in 1987 , kent beck and ward cunningham began experimenting with the idea of applying patterns to programming – specifically pattern languages – and presented their results at the oopsla conference that year design patterns gained popularity in computer science after the book design patterns was published in 1994 by the so-called '' gang of four '' ( gamma et al that same year , the first pattern languages of programming conference was held , and the following year the portland pattern repository was set up for documentation of design patterns notable books in the design pattern genre include : although design patterns have been applied practically for a long time , formalization of the concept of design patterns languished for several years design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested , proven development paradigms reusing design patterns helps to prevent such subtle issues , and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns developers use the design pattern by introducing in their designs this prototypical micro-architecture , which means that micro-architectures in their designs will have structure and organization similar to the chosen design motif efforts have also been made to codify design patterns in particular domains , including use of existing design patterns as well as domain specific design patterns examples include user interface design patterns , information visualization , secure design , '' secure usability '' , web design and business model design participants : a listing of the classes and objects used in the pattern and their roles in the design related patterns : other patterns that have some relationship with the pattern ; discussion of the differences between the pattern and similar patterns
