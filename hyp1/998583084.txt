the latter was appointed the lpo 's chief conductor in 1962 , presiding over what one player described as '' an era of supremely good taste '' pritchard was also music director of glyndebourne festival opera in sussex , and it was partly due to his influence that in 1964 the lpo replaced the rpo as glyndebourne 's resident orchestra , providing the players with stable guaranteed work in the slack summer months the number of lpo concerts in the provinces fell during the 1960s , and ceased to be a major factor in the orchestra 's finances during the 1960s the orchestra gave fund-raising concerts in which guests from outside the world of classical music appeared , including danny kaye , duke ellington and tony bennett in 1967 the lpo appointed bernard haitink as its principal conductor his concerts made a strong impression with the public , and within months the lpo was playing to ninety per cent capacity audiences at the festival hall , far outstripping the other london orchestras among the composers with whom haitink was associated were bruckner and mahler , whose symphonies featured frequently in the lpo 's concerts during the haitink period , as did those of shostakovich , particularly the tenth , which pirouet describes as the calling card of the orchestra and conductor with vladimir ashkenazy , haitink and the lpo gave a six-concert cycle of the beethoven symphonies and piano concertos , for which the festival hall was full to capacity in the times , joan chissell described the orchestra 's playing as '' worthy of any festival '' there was some discontent within the lpo that haitink 's prolific recordings were almost always with the other orchestra of which he was the chief conductor , the amsterdam concertgebouw pirouet comments that as haitink recorded exclusively for the dutch firm philips it was to be expected that the amsterdam orchestra would be preferred , and in any case the lpo was recording extensively with boult , solti , daniel barenboim and many others in 1973 the lpo was caught up in a recurring phenomenon of london orchestral life : the conviction in official circles that having four independent orchestras is too much for one city , and that two or more of the existing ensembles should merge one of the constant difficulties of london orchestras was the lack of good rehearsal space and facilities guest conductors in the 1970s included erich leinsdorf , carlo maria giulini , eugen jochum , riccardo chailly , klaus tennstedt and solti when haitink announced in 1977 that he would step down as principal conductor at the end of the 1978–79 season , solti , who had been principal guest conductor since 1971 , agreed to succeed him in the guardian , edward greenfield wrote , '' i doubt if the lpo has ever played so beautifully , even in the days of beecham '' solti stepped down at the end of the jubilee season , and was succeeded by klaus tennstedt , of whom the times commented , '' tennstedt found the orchestra sensitive and flexible , and his players regarded him with a warmth that is by no means universally extended by musicians to their conductors '' unlike his two predecessors tennstedt preferred to record with the lpo rather than major continental or american orchestras ; among the many sets they made together was a complete cycle of mahler 's symphonies for emi from the outset of the lpo 's existence as a self-governing co-operative in 1939 , its chief executive had always been appointed from within the orchestra 's ranks he continued to appear with the lpo as a guest , with the title of '' conductor laureate '' ; in 1989 richard morrison of the times wrote that the lpo still played better for tennstedt than for anyone else welser-möst concluded his lpo tenure in 1996 , after what the guardian called '' a fraught few years in which the high hopes placed in him were somehow not fulfilled in most lpo recordings for lyrita the conductor was boult ; in the same period he also recorded extensively for emi , with the lpo his preferred orchestra the orchestra lists among its best-selling recordings mahler 's eighth symphony , conducted by tennstedt , and works by rachmaninoff and tchaikovsky with jurowski in may 2011 the orchestra recorded the 205 national anthems to be used at medal ceremonies at the olympic and paralympic games in london the following year '' london 2012 hands baton to london philharmonic orchestra '' , ipc , 15 april 2011
