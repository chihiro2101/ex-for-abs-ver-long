data general ( dg ) was founded by several engineers from digital equipment corporation who were frustrated with dec 's management and left to form their own company de castro was watching developments in manufacturing , especially more complex printed circuit boards ( pcbs ) and wave soldering that suggested that the pdp-8 could be greatly cost-reduced it lacked general registers and the stack-pointer functionality of the more advanced pdp-11 , as did competing products , such as the hp 2100 ; compilers used hardware-based memory locations in lieu of a stack pointer designed to be rack-mounted similarly to the later pdp-8 machines , it was packaged on four pcb cards and was thus smaller in height , while also including a number of features that made it run considerably faster announced as '' the best small computer in the world '' , the nova quickly gained a following , especially in scientific and educational markets , and made the company flush with cash during this period the nova generated 20 % annual growth rates for the company , becoming a star in the business community and generating us 100 million in sales in 1975 in 1977 , dg launched a 16-bit microcomputer called the micronova to poor commercial success the nova series played a very important role as instruction-set inspiration to charles p thacker and others at xerox parc during their construction of the xerox alto based on many of the same concepts as the nova , it included support for virtual memory and multitasking more suitable to the small office environment many customers sued data general after more than a year of waiting , charging the company with breach of contract , while others simply canceled their orders and went elsewhere the eclipse was originally intended to replace the nova outright , evidenced by the fact that the nova 3 series , released at the same time and utilizing virtually the same internal architecture as the eclipse , was phased out the next year while dg was still struggling with eclipse , in 1977 , digital announced the vax series , their first 32-bit minicomputer line , described as '' super-minis '' development took place off-site so that even dg workers would not know of it the developers were given free rein over the design and selected a system that used a writable instruction set the idea was that the instruction set architecture ( isa ) was not fixed , programs could write their own isa and upload it as microcode to the processor 's control store this would allow the isa to be tailored to the programs being run , for instance , one might upload an isa tuned for cobol if the company 's workload included significant numbers of cobol programs when digital 's vax-11/780 was shipped in february 1978 , however , fountainhead was not yet ready to deliver a machine , due mainly to problems in project management dg 's customers left quickly for the vax world eagle was a straightforward , 32-bit extension of the nova-based eclipse it was backwards-compatible with 16-bit eclipse applications , used the same command-line interpreter , but offered improved 32-bit performance over the vax 11/780 while using fewer components by late 1979 , it became clear that eagle would deliver before fountainhead , igniting an intense turf war within the company for constantly shrinking project funds in the meantime , customers were abandoning data general in droves , driven not only by the delivery problems with the original eclipse , including very serious quality control and customer service problems , but also the power and versatility of digital 's new vax line ultimately , fountainhead was cancelled and eagle became the new mv series , with the first model , the data general eclipse mv/8000 , announced in april 1980 one of data general 's significant customers at this time was the united states forest service , which starting in the mid-1980s used dg systems installed at all levels from headquarters in washington , d.c down to individual ranger stations and fire command posts this required equipment of high reliability and generally rugged construction that could be deployed in a wide range of places , often to be maintained and used by people with no computer background at all the introduction , implementation , and effects of the dg systems in usfs were documented in a series of evaluative reports prepared in the late 1980s by the rand corporation the mv series came in various iterations , from the mv/2000 ( later mv/2500 ) , mv/4000 , mv/10000 , mv/15000 , mv/20000 , mv/30000 , mv/40000 and ultimately concluded with the mv/60000ha minicomputer the mv/60000ha was intended to be a high availability system , with many components duplicated to eliminate the single point of failure dg technicians were kept quite busy replacing boards and many blamed poor quality control at the dg factory in mexico where they were made and refurbished while the mv series did stop the erosion of dg 's customer base , this now smaller base was no longer large enough to allow dg to develop their next generation the aos/vs software was the most commonly used dg software product and included cli ( command line interpreter ) allowing for complex scripting , dump/load , and other custom components the latter provided microcode acceleration of arithmetic and conversion operations for a wide range of now-arcane data types such as overpunch characters also notable were several commercial software products developed in the mid to late 1970s in conjunction with the commercial computers in june 1987 , data general announced its intention to replace xodiac with the osi protocols '' now the customer could run any software they wished as long as it ran on unix , and by the early 1990s , everything did dg quickly responded by introduced new models of the aviion series based on a true commodity processor , the intel x86 series after leaving dg he co-founded alliant computer systems along with former dg colleague craig mundie edward zander was product marketing manager at data general before his positions at apollo computer , sun microsystems and motorola as ceo
