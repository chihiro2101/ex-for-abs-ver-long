in december 1998 , the ietf published - definition of the differentiated services field ( ds field ) in the ipv4 and ipv6 headers , which replaced the ipv4 tos field with the ds field in the ds field , a range of eight values ( class selectors ) is used for backward compatibility with the ip precedence specification in the former tos field diffserv-aware routers implement per-hop behaviors ( phbs ) , which define the packet-forwarding properties associated with a class of traffic rather than differentiating network traffic based on the requirements of an individual flow , diffserv operates on the principle of traffic classification , placing each data packet into one of a limited number of traffic classes each traffic class can be managed differently , ensuring preferential treatment for higher-priority traffic on the network a group of routers that implement common , administratively defined diffserv policies are referred to as a diffserv domain while diffserv does recommend a standardized set of traffic classes , the diffserv architecture does not incorporate predetermined judgments of what types of traffic should be given priority treatment a traffic classifier may inspect many different parameters in incoming packets , such as source address , destination address or traffic type and assign individual packets to a specific traffic class for tight control over volumes and type of traffic in a given class , a network operator may choose not to honor markings at the ingress to the diffserv domain traffic in each class may be further conditioned by subjecting the traffic to rate limiting , traffic policers or shapers explicit congestion notification ( ecn ) occupies the least-significant 2 bits of the ipv4 tos field and ipv6 traffic class ( tc ) field this gives a network operator great flexibility in defining traffic classes ef traffic is often given priority queue above all other traffic classes the af behavior group defines four separate af classes with all traffic within one class having the same priority — definition of the differentiated services field ( ds field ) in the ipv4 and ipv6 headers — a differentiated services code point ( dscp ) for capacity-admitted traffic
