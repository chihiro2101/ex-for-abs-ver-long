however , the difference in frame rates between film ( generally 24 frames/s ) and television ( 30 or 25 frames/s , interlaced ) meant that simply playing a film into a television camera would result in flickering originally the kinescope was used to record the image from a television display to film , synchronized to the tv scan rate the obvious solution is to simply speed up the film to match the television frame rates , but this , at least in the case of ntsc , is rather obvious to the eye and ear for ntsc , the difference in frame rates can be corrected by showing every fourth frame of film twice , although this does require the sound to be handled separately to avoid '' skipping '' effects a more advanced technique is to use '' 2:3 pulldown '' , discussed below , which turns every second frame of the film into three fields of video , which results in a slightly smoother display however , during the analogue broadcasting period , the 24 frame per second film was shown at a slightly faster 25 frames per second rate , to match the pal video signal the most complex part of telecine is the synchronization of the mechanical film motion and the electronic video signal in countries that use the pal or secam video standards , film destined for television is photographed at 25 frames per second the pal video standard broadcasts at 25 frames per second , so the transfer from film to video is simple ; for every film frame , one video frame is captured for film at 24 frame/s , there are 24 frames of film for every 25 frames of pal video for the film 's motion to be accurately rendered on the video signal , a telecine must use a technique called the 2:3 pulldown , also known as 3:2 pulldown , to convert from 24 to ~29.97 frame/s the term '' pulldown '' comes from the mechanical process of '' pulling '' ( physically moving ) the film downward within the film portion of the transport mechanism , to advance it from one frame to the next at a repetitive rate ( nominally 24 frames/s ) the second step of the 2:3 pulldown is distributing cinema frames into video fields
