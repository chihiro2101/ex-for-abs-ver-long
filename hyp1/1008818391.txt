'happiness ' is the subject of debate on usage and meaning , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy states that '' an important project in the philosophy of happiness is simply getting clear on what various writers are talking about '' how universal is happiness ? '' ruut veenhoven , chapter 11 in ed diener , john f dan haybron ( , ; '' i would suggest that when we talk about happiness , we are actually referring , much of the time , to a complex emotional phenomenon happiness as emotional well-being concerns your emotions and moods , more broadly your emotional condition as a whole being in good spirits , quick to laugh and slow to anger , at peace and untroubled , confident and comfortable in your own skin , engaged , energetic and full of life '' people don ’ t want to be happy the way i ’ ve defined the term – what i experience here and now in my view , it ’ s much more important for them to be satisfied , to experience life satisfaction , from the perspective of ‘ what i remember , ’ of the story they tell about their lives for instance ruut veenhoven has defined happiness as '' overall appreciation of one 's life as-a-whole '' , 1.1 2011 , '' ‘ happiness ’ is often used , in ordinary life , to refer to a short-lived state of a person , frequently a feeling of contentment : ‘ you look happy today ’ ; ‘ i ’ m very happy for you ’ and in philosophy it is possible to speak of the happiness of a person ’ s life , or of their happy life , even if that person was in fact usually pretty miserable the point is that some good things in their life made it a happy one , even though they lacked contentment “ people don ’ t want to be happy the way i ’ ve defined the term – what i experience here and now in my view , it ’ s much more important for them to be satisfied , to experience life satisfaction , from the perspective of ‘ what i remember , ’ of the story they tell about their lives 'can happiness be measured ' , action for happiness , includes measures of current experience ( emotions , moods , and feelings ) and of life satisfaction xavier landes has proposed that happiness include measures of subjective wellbeing , mood and eudaimonia 44 in the global sample ) , at all levels , with life satisfaction—strictly speaking , a “ life evaluation ” measure that asks respondents to rate their lives without saying whether they are satisfied yet the correlation of household income with the affect measures is far weaker : globally , if the results hold up , the upshot appears to be that income is pretty strongly related to life satisfaction , but weakly related to emotional well-being , at least above a certain threshold some users accept these issues , but continue to use the word because of its convening power the converse argument made in the world happiness reports is that this double usage helps to justify using happiness in a generic role , as long as the alternative meanings are clearly understood and credibly related helliwell and others , world happiness report , 2015 , quoted in what 's special about happiness as a social indicator ? john f philosophy of happiness is often discussed in conjunction with ethics however , with the rise of individualism , begotten partly by protestantism and capitalism , the links between duty in a society and happiness were gradually broken happiness is no longer defined in relation to social life , but in terms of individual psychology happiness , however , remains a difficult term for moral philosophy throughout the history of moral philosophy , there has been an oscillation between attempts to define morality in terms of consequences leading to happiness and attempts to define morality in terms that have nothing to do with happiness at all thus understood , the happy life is the good life , that is , a life in which a person fulfills human nature in an excellent way specifically , aristotle argued that the good life is the life of excellent rational activity according to aristotle , the life of excellent rational activity is the happy life aristotle argued a second best life for those incapable of excellent rational activity was the life of moral virtue these small , '' last men '' who seek after only their own pleasure and health , avoiding all danger , exertion , difficulty , challenge , struggle are meant to seem contemptible to nietzsche 's reader personal happiness aims can be effected by cultural factors hedonism appears to be more strongly related to happiness in more individualistic cultures for instance western concern about childhood being a time of happiness has occurred only since the 19th century not all cultures seek to maximise happiness , see the work of jeanne tsai see life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness meaning of '' happiness '' ref more mundane forms of happiness , such as acquiring wealth and maintaining good friendships , are also recognized as worthy goals for lay people ( see sukha ) buddhism also encourages the generation of metta and karuṇā , the desire for the happiness and welfare of all beings in advaita vedanta , the ultimate goal of life is happiness , in the sense that duality between atman and brahman is transcended and one realizes oneself to be the self in all happiness or simcha in judaism is considered an important element in the avodat hashem '' judaism 's value of happiness living with gratitude and idealism a popular teaching by rabbi nachman of breslov , a 19th-century chassidic rabbi , is '' mitzvah gedolah le'hiyot besimcha tamid , '' it is a great mitzvah ( commandment ) to always be in a state of happiness when a person is happy they are much more capable of serving god and going about their daily activities than when depressed or upset the primary meaning of '' happiness '' in various european languages involves good fortune , chance or happening the meaning in greek philosophy , however , refers primarily to ethics various writers , including camus and tolle , have written that the act of searching or seeking for happiness is incompatible with being happy in contrast , evaluative well-being asks questions such as '' how good was your vacation ? '' and measures one 's subjective thoughts and feelings about happiness in the past happiness is evaluated , as in “ how happy are you with your life as a whole ? ” , and in emotional reports , as in “ how happy are you now ? , ” and people seem able to use happiness as appropriate in these verbal contexts although these factors play a role in happiness , they do not all need to act in simultaneously to help one achieve an increase in happiness coercive regulation and the balance of freedom , edward glaeser , cato unbound 11.5.2007 good mental health and good relationships contribute more than income to happiness and governments should take these into account
