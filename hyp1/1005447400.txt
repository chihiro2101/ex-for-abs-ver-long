in general terms , the procedure for an open appendectomy is : antibiotics are given immediately if signs of actual sepsis are seen ( in appendicitis , sepsis and bacteremia usually only occurs at some point after rupture , once peritonitis has begun ) , or if there is reasonable suspicion that the appendix has ruptured ( e.g , on imaging ) or if the onset of peritonitis- which will lead to full sepsis if not quickly treated- is suspected ; otherwise , a single dose of prophylactic intravenous antibiotics is given immediately before surgery general anaesthesia is induced , with endotracheal tube and full muscle relaxant , and the patient is positioned supine otherwise , the incision is made over mcburney 's point ( one-third of the way from the anterior superior iliac spine to the navel ) , which represents the most common position of the base of the appendix some surgeons choose to bury the stump of the appendix by inverting it so it points into the caecum the standardization of an incision is not best practice when performing an appendectomy given that the appendix is a mobile organ a physical exam should be performed prior to the operation and the incision should be chosen based on the point of maximal tenderness to palpation many surgeons have attempted to reduce incisional morbidity and improve cosmetic outcomes in laparoscopic appendectomy by using fewer and smaller ports have described variants of an sling-based single-port laparoscopic appendectomy with good clinical results also , a trend is increasing towards single-incision laparoscopic surgery ( sils ) , using a special multiport umbilical trocar these findings , in addition to non-specific abdominal symptoms make appendicitis difficult to diagnose overall , there is no increased risk of fetal loss or preterm delivery with the laparoscopic approach ( la ) as compared to the open approach ( oa ) thumb thumb a study from 2010 found that the average hospital stay for people with appendicitis in the united states was 1.8 days signs and symptoms indicative of a superficial ssi are redness , swelling , and tenderness surrounding the incision and are most likely to arise on post-operative day 4 or 5 tenderness extending beyond the redness that surrounds the incision , in addition to the development of cutaneous vesicles or bullae may be indicative of a deep ssi harry hancock performed the first abdominal surgery for appendicitis in 1848 , but he did not remove the appendix on september 13 , 1980 , kurt semm performed the first laparoscopic appendectomy opening up the path for a much wider application of minimally invasive surgery
