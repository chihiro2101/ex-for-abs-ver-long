the only account of the life of zhuangzi is a brief sketch in chapter 63 of sima qian 's records of the grand historian , and most of the information it contains seems to have simply been drawn from anecdotes in the zhuangzi itself in sima 's biography , he is described as a minor official from the town of meng ( in modern anhui ) in the state of song , living in the time of king hui of wei and king xuan of qi ( late 4th century bc ) sima qian writes : : :chuang-tze had made himself well acquainted with all the literature of his time , but preferred the views of laozi ; and ranked himself among his followers , so that of the more than ten myriads of characters contained in his published writings the greater part are occupied with metaphorical illustrations of lao 's doctrines : :king wei of chu , having heard of the ability of chuang chau , sent messengers with large gifts to bring him to his court , and promising also that he would make him his chief minister '' the validity of his existence has been questioned by russell kirkland , who writes : according to modern understandings of chinese tradition , the text known as the chuang-tzu was the production of a 'taoist ' thinker of ancient china named chuang chou/zhuang zhou the chuang-tzu known to us today was the production of a thinker of the third century ce named kuo hsiang though kuo was long called merely a 'commentator , ' he was in reality much more : he arranged the texts and compiled the present 33-chapter edition however , sima qian 's biography of zhuangzi pre-dates guo xiang ( kuo hsiang ) by centuries furthermore , the han shu '' yiwenzhi '' ( monograph on literature ) lists a text zhuangzi , showing that a text with this title existed no later than the early 1st century ad , again pre-dating guo xiang by centuries zhuangzi is traditionally credited as the author of at least part of the work bearing his name , the zhuangzi this work , in its current shape consisting of 33 chapters , is traditionally divided into three parts : the first , known as the '' inner chapters '' , consists of the first seven chapters ; the second , known as the '' outer chapters '' , consist of the next 15 chapters ; the last , known as the '' mixed chapters '' , consist of the remaining 11 chapters on the one side , as martin palmer points out in the introduction to his translation , two of the three chapters sima qian cited in his biography of zhuangzi , come from the '' outer chapters '' and the third from the '' mixed chapters '' '' neither of these are allowed as authentic chuang tzu chapters by certain purists , yet they breathe the very spirit of chuang tzu just as much as , for example , the famous 'butterfly passage ' of chapter 2 in this spirit , martin palmer wrote that '' trying to read chuang tzu sequentially is a mistake in the complete works of chuang tzu , translated by burton watson it is stated that : the seeds of things have mysterious workings
