image : chicxulub-anomaly.jpg thumb gravity anomaly map of the chicxulub impact area a ring of cenotes is associated with the largest semicircular feature , although its exact origin remains unclear in the offshore magnetic data , penfield noted anomalies whose depth he estimated , and mapped 2 pencil mapping of the offshore magnetic anomalies , the fit was perfect : a shallow , 180-kilometer diameter gravity-magnetic bullseye on the almost non-magnetic , uniform carbonate background of the yucatan platform ! we recognized the crater as the likely cretaceous-paleogene boundary event '' a decade earlier , the same map suggested an impact feature to contractor robert baltosser , but he was forbidden to publicize his conclusion by pemex corporate policy of the time coincidentally , many experts in impact craters and the cretaceous–paleogene boundary were attending a separate conference on earth impacts their evidence included greenish-brown clay with surplus iridium containing shocked quartz grains and small weathered glass beads that looked to be tektites such deposits occur in many locations but seem concentrated in the caribbean basin at the k–pg boundary hildebrand interview : 'similar deposits of rubble occur all across the southern coast of north america … indicate that something extraordinary happened here ' so when haitian professor florentine morás discovered what he thought to be evidence of an ancient volcano on haiti , hildebrand suggested it could be a telltale feature of a nearby impact in 1990 , houston chronicle reporter carlos byars told hildebrand of penfield 's earlier discovery of a possible impact crater hildebrand contacted penfield in april 1990 and the pair soon secured two drill samples from the pemex wells , stored in new orleans researchers at the university of glasgow dated tektite samples from the impact as 66,038,000 ± 11,000 & nbsp ; years old the impact created a hole wide and deep , leaving a crater mainly under the sea and covered by of sediment by the 21st century in addition , the impact created winds in excess of 1000 kilometers per hour near the blast 's center the impact would have caused a megatsunami over tall that would have reached all the way to what are now texas and florida the height of the tsunami was limited by the relatively shallow sea in the area of the impact ; in deep ocean it would have been tall nonetheless , the most recent simulations show that waves may have been up to 1.5 kilometers ( ~1 & nbsp ; mi ) tall , able to reach the coastal lines all over the world a cloud of hot dust , ash and steam would have spread from the crater as the impactor burrowed underground in less than a second the emission of dust and particles could have covered the entire surface of the earth for several years , possibly a decade , creating a harsh environment for living things '' this was borne out by the results of a drilling project in 2016 which found that sulfate-containing rocks found in the area were not found in the peak ring ( the rocks found were from deep within the earth 's crust instead ) , the interpretation being that they had been vaporized by the impact and dispersed into the atmosphere the groundwater of such a basin would have dissolved the limestone and created the caves and cenotes beneath the surface bottke , david vokrouhlický , and david nesvorný , argued that a collision in the asteroid belt 160 million years ago resulted in the baptistina family of asteroids , the largest surviving member of which is 298 baptistina the connection between chicxulub and baptistina is supported by the large amount of carbonaceous material present in microscopic fragments of the impactor , suggesting the impactor was a member of an uncommon class of asteroids called carbonaceous chondrites , like baptistina in 2010 , another hypothesis was offered which implicated the newly discovered asteroid 354p/linear , a member of the flora family of asteroids , as a possible remnant cohort of the k/pg impactor in february 2021 , scientists reported studies suggesting the impactor that led to the demise of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago was a fragment from a disrupted comet , rather than an asteroid which has long been the leading candidate among scientists the impact associated with the crater is thus implicated in the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event , including the worldwide extinction of non-avian dinosaurs they concluded that the impact at chicxulub triggered the mass extinctions at the k–pg boundary it was hypothesized that the iridium was spread into the atmosphere when the impactor was vaporized and settled across the earth 's surface among other material thrown up by the impact , producing the layer of iridium-enriched clay this has led to the hypothesis that the chicxulub impact may have been only one of several impacts that happened nearly at the same time chicxulub is the only known earth crater with a remaining impact peak ring , but it is under of sediment it suggests the impact was so great it shocked and melted rocks found deep in the crust , causing them to shoot up before falling back down to produce the peak rings probing the impact-generated hydrothermal system in the peak ring of the chicxulub crater and its potential as a habitat also related to this tsunami was a dense dinosaur bone bed on the cretaceous–paleogene boundary found in patagonia
