mayapan is 4.2 square kilometers ( about 1.6 square miles ) and has over 4000 structures , most of them residences , packed into this compound within the city walls built-up areas extend a half kilometer beyond the city walls in all directions the wall is 9.1 & nbsp ; km ( about 5.65 miles ) long and is roughly ovate with a pointed northeast corner the ceremonial center of the site is located in square q of the city 's grid in the center of the wider western half of the walled enclosure smith , an archeologist with the carnegie institute , estimated 10–12,000 people lived within the walled city gregory simons survey outside the city walls , there were numerous additional dwellings and he revised the total population estimate to between 15,000–17,000 people people living outside of the city wall engaged in agriculture , animal-raising , and specialized activities such as lime production russell also found a colonnaded hall outside the city wall , revealing much is still to be discovered regarding the complexity of this urban landscape the temple of kukulcan , a large pyramid also known as the castillo , is the main temple in mayapan however , the mayapan temple appears to be an inferior imitation of the one at chichen itza , and the city 's buildings in general are not constructed as well as those in other mayan cities for example , most or all of the vaulted roofs in mayapan have collapsed , while many of the better-built buildings at chichen itza remain intact unlike chichen itza , mayapan has no ballcourts lanes wind among the residences and walls the residential areas of the site contain many cenotes , perhaps as many as 40 he convened the lords of the region , who agreed to found a new capital at mayapan the ethnohistorical sources recount multiple different histories of the rise and fall of mayapan ( roys 1962 ) for example , some sources say that the maya revolted in 1221 against the maya-toltec lords of chichen itza the new city was built within a defensive wall and named mayapan , meaning '' standard of the maya people '' another family , the xiu , may have been living in the mayapan area prior to the arrival of the cocom ; the xiu claim to be a part of the lineage from uxmal the social climate of mayapan was made complicated by the antagonistic relationship between the factions of nobles , which were often arranged by kinship ( pugh 2009 ; milbrath 2003 ) stephens was the first to document parts of the mayapan site with two important illustrations he was the first in a long string of explorers who drew the ruins of mayapan the first large-scale archeological site surveys were not conducted until 1938 by r.t these surveys mapped the main plaza group and the city wall , and were the basis of later maps ( russell 2008 ) smith , robert smith , tatiana proskouriakoff , edwin shook , karl ruppert and j the final report was published by the carnegie institution as mayapan , yucatan , mexico , by h robert smith published a two-volume monograph on the pottery of mayapan in 1971 ( papers of the peabody museum of archaeology and ethnology 66 , harvard university ) brown of tulane university carried out excavations in the residential zones of mayapan as part of his doctoral dissertation research it has resulted in the discovery of many important artifacts , murals , stuccoes , and architectural elements marilyn masson from the state university new york at albany , carlos peraza lope of inah , and timothy s great variation is now recognized in the types of work performed by commoners of different households and their degrees of affluence some evidence suggests overlapping occupation of the area by different cultures the mixture of puuc pot sherds in the lower parts of mayapan lots may support this , but it is a very small percentage of the material ( 2 % in most cases and no more than 4 % in others ) according to robert smith , the ceramicist for the carnegie institution , there were two ceramic phases in mayapan : hocaba , which he said started around a.d 1100 , which fits better with the chronology of the southern lowland sites : a burial found on bedrock in the houselot soils of a post-classical solare dated between a.d researchers think that this sample is not associated with the context in which it was found however , two of these dates come from inexact sources the early date would suggest that this temple was built and in use in mayapan 's early history it is important for suggesting that the post-classical phase in mayapan started earlier than a.d diego de landa calderon , yucatán before and after the conquest , 1937 ( reprinted in 2008 ) see : abridged history of yucatan , pp mayapan yucatan mexico , h.e.d ledyard smith , publication 619 : carnegie institution of washington , washington , d.c researchers have suggested that mayapan was an import/export center , and that they often traded luxury goods , such as cotton , salt , and honey , for products of obsidian and metal , which they would have forged the largest samples of recognized remains within the monumental center were from : white-tailed deer ( 23 % ) , dog ( 4.4 % ) , turkey ( 12.9 % ) , and iguana ( 10.2 % ) these percentages as well as the ones that will follow for the settlement zone are based on recognized remains primary animals may have made up larger portions of the diet but their remains are too difficult to recognize the temple assemblages at zacpeten are very similar to those at mayapan topoxte in lake yaxha , peten also shares similarities of architecture and artifacts of effigy censers also , tiny “ dwarf ” shrines found at this site were very similar to shrines found at mayapan architectural and artifact connections are seen between mayapan and the utatlan in highland guatemala the east coast sites exported products such as cotton , salt , and honey from the yucatán el chayal in guatemala was the only source of the obsidian found at mayapan some mayapan figures showed details of aztec dress , and what appears to be an aztec deity is carved on an altar in mayapan the symbolism present in mayapan is particularly significant , partially because the center of the site is mainly used for ritual purposes there are many similarities between the murals in mayapan and the art and iconography of the aztec and mixteca-puebla regions 2010 ) serpent iconography is very common at mayapan , serpent balustrade carvings are common throughout the ritual center in the complexes that are associated with the cocom lineage like the castillo ( milbrath , susan pestilence may have been involved in the subsequent abandonment of the site by the remaining xiu inhabitants 1270–1400 , prior to the documented collapse of mayapan 2008 metallurgy , mayapan and the postclassic world system tatiana proskouriakoff ( 1962 ) civic and religious structures at mayapán , in “ introduction , ” in mayapán , yucatan , mexico , by harry e '' literary sources for the history of mayapan '' , in mayapan , yucatán , mexico
