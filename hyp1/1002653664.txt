laboratories used for scientific research take many forms because of the differing requirements of specialists in the various fields of science and engineering a physics laboratory might contain a particle accelerator or vacuum chamber , while a metallurgy laboratory could have apparatus for casting or refining metals or for testing their strength a chemist or biology might use a wet laboratory , while a psychology laboratory might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior in some laboratories , such as those commonly used by computer scientists , computers ( sometimes supercomputers ) are used for either simulations or the analysis of data scientists in other fields will use still other types of laboratories scientific laboratories can be found as research room and learning spaces in schools and university , industry , government , or military facilities , and even aboard ships and spacecraft '' the emergence of big science during world war ii increased the size of laboratories and scientific equipment , introducing particle accelerators and similar devices the earliest laboratory according to the present evidence is a home laboratory of pythagoras of samos , the well-known greek philosopher and scientist this laboratory was created when pythagoras conducted an experiment about tones of sound and vibration of string a 16th century underground alchemical laboratory was accidentally discovered in the year 2002 the laboratory is called speculum alchemiae and is preserved as a museum in prague the title of laboratory is also used for certain other facilities where the processes or equipment used are similar to those in scientific laboratories image:2008-07-02 eye wash station.jpg thumb an eyewash station in a laboratory an important element of such audits is the review of regulatory compliance and the training of individuals who have access to or work in the laboratory work is divided , not only between different jobs of the laboratory such as the researchers , engineers and technicians , but also in terms of autonomy ( should the work be individual or in groups ) from the 1950s , the laboratory has evolved from being an educational tool used by teachers to attract the top students into research , into an organizational model allowing a high level of scientific productivity a locator is an employee of a laboratory who is in charge of knowing where each member of the laboratory currently is , based on a unique signal emitted from the badge of each staff member by looking at the various interactions among staff members , we can determine their social position in the organization in summary , differences in attitude among members of the laboratory are explained by social organization : a person 's attitudes are intimately related to the role they have in an organization
