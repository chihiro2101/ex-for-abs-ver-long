in commercial aviation the major western manufacturers of turbofan engines are pratt & whitney ( a subsidiary of raytheon technologies ) , ge aviation , rolls-royce , and cfm international ( a joint venture of safran aircraft engines and general electric ) 1848 : john stringfellow made a steam engine for a 10-foot wingspan model aircraft which achieved the first powered flight , albeit with negligible payload 1903 : charlie taylor built an inline engine , mostly of aluminum , for the wright flyer ( 12 horsepower ) 1906 : léon levavasseur produces a successful water-cooled v8 engine for aircraft use 1908 : rené lorin patents a design for the ramjet engine 1908 : louis seguin designed the gnome omega , the world 's first rotary engine to be produced in quantity 1930 : frank whittle submitted his first patent for a turbojet engine june 1939 : heinkel he 176 is the first successful aircraft to fly powered solely by a liquid-fueled rocket engine 1940 : jendrassik cs-1 , the world 's first run of a turboprop engine 1945 : first turboprop-powered aircraft flies , a modified gloster meteor with two rolls-royce trent engines 1947 : bell x-1 rocket-propelled aircraft exceeds the speed of sound 1948 : 100 shp 782 , the first turboshaft engine to be applied to aircraft use ; in 1950 used to develop the larger turbomeca artouste 1950 : rolls-royce conway , the world 's first production turbofan , enters service 2020 : pipistrel e-811 is the first electric aircraft engine to be awarded a type certificate by easa the greatest advantage of an inline engine is that it allows the aircraft to be designed with a low frontal area to minimize drag the disadvantages of an inline engine include a poor power-to-weight ratio , because the crankcase and crankshaft are long and thus heavy an in-line engine may be either air-cooled or liquid-cooled , but liquid-cooling is more common because it is difficult to get enough air-flow to cool the rear cylinders directly inline engines were common in early aircraft ; one was used in the wright flyer , the aircraft that made the first controlled powered flight however , the inherent disadvantages of the design soon became apparent , and the inline design was abandoned , becoming a rarity in modern aviation for other configurations of aviation inline engine , such as x engine , u engine , h engine , etc cylinders in this engine are arranged in two in-line banks , typically tilted 60–90 degrees apart from each other and driving a common crankshaft a horizontally opposed engine , also called a flat or boxer engine , has two banks of cylinders on opposite sides of a centrally located crankcase in addition , the compact cylinder arrangement reduces the engine 's frontal area and allows a streamlined installation that minimizes aerodynamic drag opposed , air-cooled four- and six-cylinder piston engines are by far the most common engines used in small general aviation aircraft requiring up to per engine aircraft that require more than per engine tend to be powered by gas turbine because the cylinder arrangement exposes a large amount of the engine 's heat-radiating surfaces to the air and tends to cancel reciprocating forces , radials tend to cool evenly and run smoothly most radial engines have the cylinders arranged evenly around the crankshaft , although some early engines , sometimes called semi-radials or fan configuration engines , had an uneven arrangement in military aircraft designs , the large frontal area of the engine acted as an extra layer of armor for the pilot also air-cooled engines , without vulnerable radiators , are slightly less prone to battle damage , and on occasion would continue running even with one or more cylinders shot away however , the large frontal area also resulted in an aircraft with an aerodynamic increased frontal area the advantage of this arrangement is that a satisfactory flow of cooling air is maintained even at low airspeeds , retaining the weight advantage and simplicity of a conventional air-cooled engine without one of their major drawbacks before the first world war most speed records were gained using gnome-engined aircraft , and in the early years of the war rotary engines were dominant in aircraft types for which speed and agility were paramount considerable development of these designs started after world war ii , but at the time the aircraft industry favored the use of turbine engines it was believed that turbojet or turboprop engines could power all aircraft , from the largest to smallest designs . on 18 may 2020 , the pipistrel e-811 was the first electric aircraft engine to be awarded a type certificate by easa for use in general aviation turbofans were among the first engines to use multiple spools—concentric shafts that are free to rotate at their own speed—to let the engine react more quickly to changing power requirements in the case of the twin-engine english electric lightning , which has two fuselage-mounted jet engines one above the other , engine no aircraft diesel engine aviation safety engine configuration federal aviation regulations hyper engine list of aircraft engines model engine united states military aircraft engine designations
