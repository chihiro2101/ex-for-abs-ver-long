succinylcholine chloride injection indicated , in addition to general anesthesia , to facilitate tracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation it may be better than rocuronium in people without contraindications due to its faster onset of action and shorter duration of action it is indicated , in addition to general anesthesia , to facilitate tracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation suxamethonium is also commonly used as the sole muscle relaxant during electroconvulsive therapy , favoured for its short duration of action suxamethonium is quickly degraded by plasma butyrylcholinesterase and the duration of effect is usually in the range of a few minutes in people with neuromuscular disease or burns , an injection of suxamethonium can lead to a large release of potassium from skeletal muscles , potentially resulting in cardiac arrest the side effect of high blood potassium may occur because the acetylcholine receptor is propped open , allowing continued flow of potassium ions into the extracellular fluid a typical increase of potassium ion serum concentration on administration of suxamethonium is 0.5 & nbsp ; mmol per liter high blood potassium does not generally result in adverse effects below a concentration of 6.5 to 7 meq per liter therefore , the increase in serum potassium level is usually not catastrophic in otherwise healthy patients the normal short duration of action of suxamethonium is due to the rapid metabolism of the drug by non-specific plasma cholinesterases mivacurium , a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug , is also metabolized via the same route with a similar clinical effect in patients deficient in plasma cholinesterase activity in normal skeletal muscle , acetylcholine dissociates from the receptor following depolarization and is rapidly hydrolyzed by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase suxamethonium has a longer duration of effect than acetylcholine , and is not hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase
