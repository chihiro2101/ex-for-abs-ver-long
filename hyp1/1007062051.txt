up until world war ii , australia had been one of the world 's leading centres of aviation in the words of director general of civil aviation ab corbett , a nation which refuses to use flying in its national life must necessarily today be a backward and defenceless nation by the end of the war , there were only nine domestic airlines remaining , eight smaller regional concerns and australian national airways ( ana ) , a conglomerate owned by british and australian shipping interests which had a virtual monopoly on the major trunk routes and received 85 % of all government air transport subsidies the chifley government 's view was summed up by minister for air , arthur drakeford : where are the great pioneers of aviation ? air transport , the government believed , was primarily a public service , like hospitals , the railways or the post office in august 1945 , only two days after the end of world war ii , the australian parliament passed the australian national airways bill , which set up the australian national airways commission ( anac ) and charged it with the task of reconstructing the nation 's air transport industry in keeping with the labor government 's socialist leanings , the bill declared that the licenses of private operators would lapse for those routes that were adequately serviced by the national carrier however , a legal challenge , backed by the liberal opposition and business interests generally , was successful and in december 1945 , the high court ruled that the commonwealth did not have the power to prevent the issue of airline licenses to private companies the commissioners themselves were prominent high-achievers , including the director-general of civil aviation , the deputy director , a labor party luminary and former member of the commonwealth bank board , the director-general of posts and telegraphs , and the assistant secretary of the treasury coles was one of the richest men in australia and the co-founder of the coles

rivalry between the privately owned ansett-ana and the government-supported taa although government-owned , the menzies government ( 1949–66 ) of the 1950s had a philosophical leaning towards the needs of the privately owned ansett and the requirements of taa suffered as a result the controversial two airlines policy was introduced and effectively seriously limited growth and expansion opportunities for the airlines without government approval flight numbers and schedules were strictly controlled , and taa and ansett-ana invariably had flights departing airports for the same destination at exactly the same time with exactly the same equipment the policy was so strict that even newly purchased identical aircraft ( one from each airline ) were required on their delivery flights to enter australian airspace at exactly the same time the conservative government 's benevolent attitude towards ansett was epitomised in the 1950s when it forced taa to swap a number of its popular turbo-prop viscount aircraft with ansett-ana in return for slower and older , piston-engined douglas dc-6bs one of the more memorable television advertisements of the period was the jingle '' up , up and away , with taa , the friendly friendly way '' , whose lyrics and music were a variation on the 1967 song up , up and away , written by jimmy webb and also used by the us airline trans
