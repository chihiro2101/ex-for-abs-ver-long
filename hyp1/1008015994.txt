in return , the bank charges the company interest the amount of interest payment depends on the interest rate and the amount of capital they deposited base rate usually refers to the annualized rate offered on overnight deposits by the central bank or other monetary authority based on the banking business , there are deposit interest rate and loan interest rate based on the relationship between supply and demand of market interest rate , there are fixed interest rate and floating interest rate interest rate targets are a vital tool of monetary policy and are taken into account when dealing with variables like investment , inflation , and unemployment the central banks of countries generally tend to reduce interest rates when they wish to increase investment and consumption in the country 's economy for example , the federal reserve federal funds rate in the united states has varied between about 0.25 % and 19 % from 1954 to 2008 , while the bank of england base rate varied between 0.5 % and 15 % from 1989 to 2009 , moneyextra.com interest rate history political short-term gain : lowering interest rates can give the economy a short-run boost since according to time preference theory people prefer goods now to goods later , in a free market there will be a positive interest rate commonwealth bank why do interest rates change ? economy : interest rates can fluctuate according to the status of the economy it will generally be found that if the economy is strong then the interest rates will be high , if the economy is weak the interest rates will be low in many law disputes , where interest has to be calculated , an average rate of interest has to be assumed as the legal rate if we inquire further as to why the limits of a mean rate of interest can not be deduced from general laws , we find the answer lies simply in the nature of interest for example , suppose someone deposits 100 with a bank for 1 year , and they receive interest of 10 ( before tax ) , so at the end of the year , their balance is 110 ( before tax ) the real interest rate measures the growth in real value of the loan plus interest , taking inflation into account the real interest rate is zero in this case the existence of the negative overnight deposit rate was a technical consequence of the fact that overnight deposit rates are generally set at 0.5 % below or 0.75 % below the policy rate the most notable example of this was nestle , some of whose aaa-rated bonds traded at negative nominal interest rate in 2015
