there are several theories about how and when gender identity forms , and studying the subject is difficult because children 's lack of language requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence john money suggested children might have awareness of and attach some significance to gender as early as 18 months to 2 years ; lawrence kohlberg argued that gender identity does not form until age 3 '' and attempts to reassign it can result in gender dysphoria coleman , developmental stages of the coming out process , in journal of homosexuality , 1982 : '' core gender and sex-role identities are well-formed by the age of 3 ( money & ehrhardt , 1972 ) '' gender identity refinement extends into the fourth to sixth years of age , stein mt , zucker kj , dixon sd '' gender identity '' , the nurse practitioner martin and ruble conceptualize this process of development as three stages : ( 1 ) as toddlers and preschoolers , children learn about defined characteristics , which are socialized aspects of gender ; ( 2 ) around the ages of 5–7 years , identity is consolidated and becomes rigid ; ( 3 ) after this '' peak of rigidity '' , fluidity returns and socially defined gender roles relax somewhat barbara newmann breaks it down into four parts : ( 1 ) understanding the concept of gender , ( 2 ) learning gender role standards and stereotypes , ( 3 ) identifying with parents , and ( 4 ) forming gender preference according to un agencies , discussions relating to comprehensive sexuality education raise awareness of topics , such as gender and gender identity although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood , many factors have been suggested as influencing its development in particular , the extent to which it is determined by socialization ( environmental factors ) versus innate ( biological ) factors is an ongoing debate in psychology , known as '' nature versus nurture '' biological factors that influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels 44 : '' when assigned and raised as boys , these genetic girls adopt a male gender identity and role , showing that a y chromosome is not necessary for gender development to proceed in a male direction '' social factors which may influence gender identity include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family , authority figures , mass media , and other influential people in a child 's life when children are raised by individuals who adhere to stringent gender roles , they are more likely to behave in the same way , matching their gender identity with the corresponding stereotypical gender patterns language also plays a role : children , while learning a language , learn to separate masculine and feminine characteristics and subconsciously adjust their own behavior to these predetermined roles williams , michael , '' cultural identity , language identity , gender identity '' , '' the english academy of south africa '' , 2011 the social learning theory posits that children furthermore develop their gender identity through observing and imitating gender-linked behaviors , and then being rewarded or punished for behaving that way , myers , david g john money was instrumental in the early research of gender identity , though he used the term gender role in money 's opinion , if the parent confidently raised their child as the opposite sex , the child would believe that they were born that sex and act accordingly one criticism of the reimer case is that reimer lost his penis at the age of eight months and underwent sex reassignment surgery at seventeen months , which possibly meant that reimer had already been influenced by his socialization as a boy she reported that she had been somewhat tomboyish during childhood , enjoying stereotypically masculine childhood toys and interests , although her childhood friends were girls griet vandermassen argues that since these are the only two cases being documented in scientific literature , this makes it difficult to draw any firm conclusions from them about the origins of gender identity , particularly given the two cases reached different conclusions however , vandermassen also argues that transgender people support the idea of gender identity as being biologically rooted , as they do not identify with their anatomical sex despite being raised and their behaviour reinforced according to their anatomical sex six of them changed their gender identity to male , five remained female and three had ambiguous gender identities ( though two of them had declared they were male ) '' discordant sexual identity in some genetic males with cloacal exstrophy assigned to female sex at birth ) , looked at males raised as females due to a variety of developmental disorders ( penile agenesis , cloacal exstrophy or penile ablation ) a minority of those raised as female later switched to male the study 's authors caution drawing any strong conclusions from it due to numerous methodological caveats which were a severe problem in studies of this nature an intersex human or other animal is one possessing any of several variations in sex characteristics including chromosomes , gonads , sex hormones , or genitals that , according to the un office of the high commissioner for human rights , '' do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies '' a 2005 study on the gender identity outcomes of female-raised 46 , xy persons with penile agenesis , cloacal exstrophy of the bladder , or penile ablation , found that 78 % of the study subjects were living as female , as opposed to 22 % who decided to initiate a sex change to male in line with their genetic sex the study concludes : '' the findings clearly indicate an increased risk of later patient-initiated gender re-assignment to male after female assignment in infancy or early childhood , but are nevertheless incompatible with the notion of a full determination of core gender identity by prenatal androgens sociological research in australia , a country with a third ' x ' sex classification , shows that 19 % of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an '' x '' or ''

it was hypothesized , and proven , that parent behaviors , rather than parent beliefs , regarding gender are better predictors for a child 's attitude on gender his work at johns hopkins university 's gender identity clinic ( established in 1965 ) popularized an interactionist theory of gender identity , suggesting that , up to a certain age , gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation gender dysphoria ( previously called '' gender identity disorder '' or gid in the dsm ) is the formal diagnosis of people who experience significant dysphoria ( discontent ) with
