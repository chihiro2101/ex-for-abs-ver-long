the party was founded on 7 april 1947 as the arab ba'ath party by michel aflaq ( an antiochian christian ) , salah al-din al-bitar ( a sunni muslim ) , and the followers of zaki al-arsuzi ( an atheist ) in damascus , syria , leading to the establishment of the syrian regional branch other regional branches were established throughout the arab world in the later 1940s and early 1950s , in , among others , iraq , yemen and jordan throughout its existence , the national command ( the body responsible for all-arab affairs ) , gave most attention to syrian affairs the 2nd national congress was convened in june 1954 , and elected a seven-man national command ; aflaq , bitar , and akram al-hawrani were elected and represented the syrian regional branch , while abdullah rimawi and abdallah na'was were elected to represent the jordanian branch the congress is notable for sanctioning the merger of the arab socialist movement and the ba'ath party , which took place in 1952 the syrian regional branch rose to prominence in the 1940s and 1950s ; in the 1954 parliamentary elections the syrian regional branch won 22 seats in parliament , becoming the second largest party in the country 90 percent of ba'ath party members who stood for elections were elected to parliament the failure of the traditional parties represented by the people 's party and the national party , strengthened the ba'ath party 's public credibility its new , strengthened position , was used successfully to garner support for syria 's merger with gamal abdel nasser 's egypt , which led to the establishment of the united arab republic ( uar ) in 1958 on 24 june 1959 , fuad al-rikabi , the regional secretary of the iraqi regional branch , accused the national command of betraying arab nationalist principles by conspiring against the uar the congress is notable for endorsing the dissolution of the syrian regional branch , which had been decided by aflaq and bitar without inner-party consultation in 1958 , and for expelling rimawi , the regional secretary of the jordanian regional branch rimawi reacted to his expulsion by forming his own party , the arab socialist revolutionary ba'ath party , which established a rival national command to compete with the original the national command responded to the problems in iraq by appointing a temporary regional command on 2 february 1960 , which appointed talib el-shibib as regional secretary , and on 15 june 1961 the national command expelled rikabi from the party in iraq , the iraqi regional branch had supported abd al-karim qasim 's seizure of power and its ensuing abolishment of the iraqi monarchy however , this was proven to be a ruse , and after taking power qasim launched an iraq first policy qasim was overthrown in the ramadan revolution led by young ba'athist officer ahmed hassan al-bakr , and rumoured to be supported by the american central intelligence agency ( cia ) on a separate plan to instigate a military coup against qasim , and who later became the head of the cia 's operations in iraq and syria '' from late 1968 to june 1970 , '' has '' denied any involvement in the ba'ath party 's actions '' the iraqi regional branch , when it took power , was so riven by factionalism that its purported allies launched a counter-coup forcing them out of power in november 1963 the 4th national congress , held in august 1960 , criticized the leadership of aflaq and bitar , called for the reestablishment of the syrian regional branch and deemphasized the party 's commitment to arab nationalism while emphasizing more the socialist character of the party a year after , at the uar 's nadir in syria , the syrian general abd al-karim al-nahlawi launched a coup on 28 september 1961 , which led to the reestablishment of the syrian arab republic the challenges of building a ba'athist state led to considerable ideological discussion and internal struggle within the party aflaq , angry at this transformation of his party , retained a nominal leadership role , but the national command as a whole came under the control of the radicals in 1963 the ba'ath party seized power , from then on the ba'ath functioned as the only officially recognized syrian political party , but factionalism and splintering within the party led to a succession of governments and new constitutions several of jadid 's opponents managed to make their escape and fled to beirut , lebanon the organizational structure ran from top to bottom , and members were forbidden to initiate contacts between groups on the same level of the organisation—all contacts had to pass through a higher command level the national congress elected the national command , national tribunal , the party 's discipline body , and the secretary-general , the party leader in ba'athist jargon '' nation '' means the arab nation , because of that , the national command formed the highest policy-making and coordinating council for the ba'ath movement throughout the arab world the national command had several bureaus , similar to those of the regional command a '' region '' ( quṭr ) , in ba'athist parlance , is an arab state such as syria , iraq , or lebanon the regional congress is made of delegates from the provincial branches ; other members attended , but as observers the regional command , similar to the branch command , operated through bureaus and met for weekly-sessions the branch held a congress periodically in which it elected a command and a secretary ( leader ) such ba'athist groups occurred throughout the bureaucracy and the military the military organization was made up of branches similar to those in the ba'ath 's civilian sector there existed three types of membership categories in the ba'ath party ; active member ( arabic : udw ämil ) , apprentice member ( arabic : udw mutadarrib ) and supporter ( arabic : firqa ) '' to express his heartfelt belief in arab nationalism , aflaq coined the term '' one arab nation with an eternal message '' party ideology , and ba'athism in general , was not based on concepts such as the purity of the arab race or ethnic chauvinism , but on idealistic thoughts borrowed from the enlightenment era according to middle east expert tabitha petran , the basic idea of the party 's ideology was ; that the arab nation is a permanent entity in history the arab nation is considered , philosophically speaking , not as a social and economic formation , but as a transcendent fact inspiring different forms , one of its highest contributions taking the form of islam the early ba'ath gave little attention to the problems facing the peasants and workers most of the delegates were either school teacher or students attending universities the '' transitional ba'ath '' , which grew out of the dissolution of the syrian regional branch in 1958 dissolution and the military committee , were more rural in outlook , policy and ideology aflaq believed that the ba'ath party , at least in theory , would rule , and guide the people , in a transitional period of time without consulting the people , however he did support intra-party democracy the original interpretation of arab socialism did not answer questions such as : how much state control was necessary , or economic equality ; but instead focused on freeing the arab nation and its people from colonization and oppression in general after the failure of the united arab republic ( uar ) , a union of egypt and syria , the ba'ath party was divided into two main factions , the regionalists and the nationalists ( pan-arab ) on 21 february 1962 , the national command issued a new policy regarding the pan-arab project by first mentioning the successes and failures of the uar , but ending the statement by calling for the reestablishment of the uar as a decentralized federation with nasser 's egypt the provincial party members had not been told of the syrian regional branch 's dissolution , which in fact broke the communication line with provincial branches and the national command the disillusionment felt among party members on the pan-arab project , led to the radicalization of the party 's interpretation of socialism jamal al-atassi , who had been a moderate socialist for most of his life , called for the renunciation of arab socialism in 1963 and the adoption of a '' virtually marxist concept of socialism '' by claiming that class conflict was the moving force in society hammud al-shufi became the leader of the party 's marxist faction during his short stint as syrian regional secretary , literally the head of the syrian regional organization the military committee , which now controlled the syrian regional branch , took control of the ba'ath party in the coup of 1966 according to middle east expert avraham ben-tzur '' the neo-ba'th in its latest variant is a bureaucratic apparatus headed by the military , whose daily life and routine are shaped by the rigid military oppression on the home front , and soviet aid among others military aid at the 6th national congress , the lebanese regional branch elected jubrän majdalani and khalid al-ali to the national command during the congress , aflaq and the military committee , through muhammad umran , made contact for the first time ; the committee asked for permission to initiate a coup d'état ; aflaq supported the conspiracy whatever the case , the syrian regional command slowly amassed its powers by weakening the national command
