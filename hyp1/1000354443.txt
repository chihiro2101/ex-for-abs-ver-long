10 , alexander hamilton and james madison , respectively , wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic political factions richard hofstadter , the idea of a party system : the rise of legitimate opposition in the united states , 1780–1840 ( 1970 ) gordon s wood , empire of liberty : a history of the early republic , 1789–1815 ( oxford history of the united states ) starting with the 1796 election , congressional party or a state legislature party caucus selected the party 's presidential candidates that system collapsed in 1824 , and since 1832 the preferred mechanism for nomination has been a national convention chase ; emergence of the presidential nominating convention , 1789–1832 ( 1973 ) the first national convention was called by the anti-masonic party in 1831 , as they could not use the caucus system because they had no congressmen the party leaders instead called for a national meeting of supporters to set the party 's candidate delegates to the national convention were usually selected at state conventions whose own delegates were chosen by district conventions progressive era reformers looked to the primary election as a way to measure popular opinion of candidates , as opposed to the opinion of the bosses florida enacted the first presidential primary in 1901 in 1910 , oregon became the first state to establish a presidential preference primary , which requires delegates to the national convention to support the winner of the primary at the convention by 1912 , twelve states either selected delegates in primaries , used a preferential primary , or both by 1920 there were 20 states with primaries , but some went back , and from 1936 to 1968 , 12 states used them roosevelt proved the most popular candidate , but as most primaries were non-binding '' preference '' shows and held in only fourteen of the-then forty-eight states , the republican nomination went to taft , who controlled the convention the impetus for national adoption of the binding primary election was the chaotic 1968 democratic national convention after this , a democratic national committee-commissioned panel led by senator george mcgovern – the mcgovern–fraser commission – recommended that states adopt new rules to assure wider participation a large number of states , faced with the need to conform to more detailed rules for the selection of national delegates , chose a presidential primary as an easier way to come into compliance with the new national democratic party rules the result was that many more future delegates would be selected by a state presidential primary the republicans also adopted many more state presidential primaries the first regional primary was the southern super tuesday of march 8 , 1988 , in which nine states united in the idea that a candidate would reflect regional interests another trend is to stage earlier and earlier primaries , given impetus by super tuesday and the mid-1990s move ( since repealed ) of the california primary and its bloc of votes—the largest in the nation—from june to march a major reason states try to increase their influence , and vie for earlier primaries , is that in recent years the races have usually been decided before the primary season has ended in june for example , john mccain officially clinched the 2008 republican presidential nomination in march , while during that same month barack obama held a substantial lead in pledged delegates in the democratic party primaries in 2012 , both the republicans and the democrats moved their florida primary to january 31 , which was an earlier date than past election cycles in response , other states also changed their primary election dates for 2012 , in order to claim a greater influence , creating a cascade of changes in other states this followed what happened in 2008 when nevada moved its caucuses to january , causing other states to also move their primaries to earlier dates territories are not represented in the electoral college , and thus voters residing in those areas are basically ineligible to vote in the general election both the democratic and republican parties , as well as other third parties , have agreed to let these territories participate in the presidential nomination process in the two major party 's rules , '' territories '' are referred to as '' states '' , which can be carried over in discussion and media implying there are more than 50 states serious challenges are rare , but then generally presage failure to win the general election in the fall during the 1976 republican party primaries , then-former california governor reagan carried 23 states while running against incumbent president gerald ford ; ford then went on to lose the presidential election to jimmy carter senator ted kennedy then carried 12 states while running against carter during the 1980 democratic party primaries ; reagan then defeated carter in the fall pat buchanan captured a decent percentage of a protest vote against george h.w each of these conventions is attended by a number of delegates selected in accordance with the given party 's bylaws the results of the presidential primaries and caucuses bind many of these delegates , known as pledged delegates , to vote for a particular candidate republicans have three at-large delegates selected at the state convention from all the states and territories , 168 in number in democratic primaries through 2016 , about 85 % of delegates to the democratic national convention are '' pledged delegates '' who are apportioned to candidates according to the results of primaries and caucuses , senators and representatives ) , former and current democratic presidents and vice presidents , and a few leaders of democratic national committee-affiliated organizations , such as the young democrats of america ) who can vote for whomever they wish in 2016 , following a push by senator bernie sanders , burgess everett & seung min kim , sanders ' anti-superdelegate push gains steam in senate , politico ( june 21 , 2016 ) instead of going to a polling place , voters attend local private events run by the political parties , and cast their selections there one disadvantage of caucuses is that the state party runs the process directly instead of having the state and local governments run them nearly all states have a binding primary or caucus , in which the results of the election depending on state law or party rules legally bind some or all of the delegates to vote for a particular candidate at the national convention , for a certain number of ballots or until the candidate releases the delegates some binding primaries are winner-take-all contests , in which all of a state 's delegates are required to vote for the same candidate in a proportional vote , a state 's delegation is allocated in proportion to the candidates ' percent of the popular vote in a congressional district in many of those states that have proportional vote primaries , a candidate must meet a certain threshold in the popular vote to be given delegates in many states , only voters registered with a party may vote in that party 's primary , known as a closed primary in some states , a semi-closed primary is practiced , in which voters unaffiliated with a party ( independents ) may choose a party primary in which to vote in an open primary , any voter may vote in any party 's primary a semi-open primary occurs when a voter must choose a party-specific ballot to cast , instead of being provided a single ballot where the voter must choose on the ballot itself which party 's primary to vote in territories of american samoa , guam , the northern mariana islands , puerto rico , and the us virgin islands are instead assigned a fixed number of pledged delegates states and territories who schedule their primary or caucus later in the primary season may also get additional bonus delegates kerry went on to overcome dean 's initial lead in new hampshire to win that primary , and eventually the democratic presidential nomination the delaware plan was put to vote at republican national convention of 2000 and rejected in the 2008 republican primary , states that ran early primaries were punished by a reduction of 50 % in the number of delegates they could send to the national convention for democrats , states violating these rules will be penalized half of their pledged delegates and all of their unpledged delegates
