adam smith , in his seminal work the wealth of nations , described wealth as '' the annual produce of the land and labour of the society '' in popular usage , wealth can be described as an abundance of items of economic value , or the state of controlling or possessing such items , usually in the form of money , real estate and personal property an individual who is considered wealthy , affluent , or rich is someone who has accumulated substantial wealth relative to others in their society or reference group in economics , net worth refers to the value of assets owned minus the value of liabilities owed at a point in time wealth can be categorized into three principal categories : personal property , including homes or automobiles ; monetary savings , such as the accumulation of past income ; and the capital wealth of income producing assets , including real estate , stocks , bonds , and businesses wealth provides a type of individual safety net of protection against an unforeseen decline in one 's living standard in the event of job loss or other emergency and can be transformed into home ownership , business ownership , or even a college education wealth has been defined as a collection of things limited in supply , transferable , and useful in satisfying human desires when a desirable or valuable commodity ( transferable good or skill ) is abundantly available to everyone , the owner of the commodity will possess no potential for wealth 'wealth ' refers to some accumulation of resources ( net asset value ) , whether abundant or not the term implies a social contract on establishing and maintaining ownership in relation to such items which can be invoked with little or no effort and expense on the part of the owner a personal net worth of us 10,000 in most parts of the united states would certainly not place a person among the wealthiest citizens of that locale modern labor-saving inventions and the development of the sciences have vastly improved the standard of living in modern societies for even the poorest of people this comparative wealth across time is also applicable to the future ; given this trend of human advancement , it is possible that the standard of living that the wealthiest enjoy today will be considered impoverished by future generations however , physical capital , as it came to be known , consisting of both the natural capital and the infrastructural capital , became the focus of the analysis of wealth adam smith saw wealth creation as the combination of materials , labour , land , and technology in such a way as to capture a profit ( excess above the cost of production ) an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations the theories of david ricardo , john locke , john stuart mill , in the 18th century and 19th century built on these views of wealth that we now call classical economics marxian economics ( see labor theory of value ) distinguishes in the grundrisse between material wealth and human wealth , defining human wealth as '' wealth in human relations '' ; land and labour were the source of all material wealth billionaires such as bill gates , jeff bezos , warren buffett , elon musk , charlie munger and others advise the following principles of wealth creation : science and scientific method economics and continuous lifelong learning aristotle describes the basic function of money as a universal instrument of quantitative measurement '' for it measures all things … '' making things alike and comparable due to a social '' agreement '' of acceptance in that way , money also enables a new type of economic society and the definition of wealth in measurable quantities , such as gold and money for national wealth as measured in the national accounts , the net liabilities are those owed to the rest of the world wealth or savings is a stock variable – that is , it is measurable at a date in time , for example the value of an orchard on december 31 minus debt owed on the orchard what marks the income as a flow is its measurement per unit of time , such as the value of apples yielded from the orchard per year one feature of its effect on economic behavior is the wealth elasticity of demand , which is the percentage change in the amount of consumption goods demanded for each one-percent change in wealth wealth may be measured in nominal or real values – that is , in money value as of a given date or adjusted to net out price changes the assets include those that are tangible ( land and capital ) and financial ( money , bonds , etc measurable wealth typically excludes intangible or nonmarketable assets such as human capital and social capital accounting measures net worth in terms of the historical cost of assets while economics measures wealth in terms of current values '' are government bonds net wealth ?
