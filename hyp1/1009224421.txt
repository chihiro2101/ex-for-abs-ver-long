the names somatotropin ( sth ) or somatotropic hormone refer to the growth hormone produced naturally in animals and extracted from carcasses the main growth hormone produced by recombinant dna technology has the approved generic name ( inn ) somatropin and the brand name humatrope , and is properly abbreviated rhgh in the scientific literature genes for human growth hormone , known as growth hormone 1 ( somatotropin ; pituitary growth hormone ) and growth hormone 2 ( placental growth hormone ; growth hormone variant ) , are localized in the q22-24 region of chromosome 17 and are closely related to somatomammotropin ( also known as placental lactogen ) genes gh , human chorionic somatomammotropin , and prolactin belong to somatotropin family with growth-promoting and lactogenic activity the major isoform of the human growth hormone is a protein of 191 amino acids and a molecular weight of 22,124 daltons it appears that , in structure , gh is evolutionarily homologous to prolactin and chorionic somatomammotropin despite marked structural similarities between growth hormone from different species , only human and old world monkey growth hormones have significant effects on the human growth hormone receptor furthermore , these variants circulate partially bound to a protein ( growth hormone-binding protein , ghbp ) , which is the truncated part of the growth hormone receptor , and an acid-labile subunit ( als ) secretion of growth hormone ( gh ) in the pituitary is regulated by the neurosecretion nuclei of the hypothalamus these cells release the peptides growth hormone-releasing hormone ( ghrh or somatocrinin ) and somatostatin ( ghih or somatostatin ) into the hypophyseal portal venous blood surrounding the pituitary somatotropic cells in the anterior pituitary gland then synthesize and secrete gh in a pulsatile manner , in response to these stimuli by the hypothalamus the largest and most predictable of these gh peaks occurs about an hour after onset of sleep with plasma levels of 13 to 72 & nbsp ; ng/ml nearly fifty percent of gh secretion occurs during the third and fourth nrem sleep stages between the peaks , basal gh levels are low , usually less than 5 & nbsp ; ng/ml for most of the day and night effects of growth hormone on the tissues of the body can generally be described as anabolic ( building up ) thus , gh exerts some of its effects by binding to receptors on target cells , where it activates the mapk/erk pathway gh also stimulates , through the jak-stat signaling pathway , the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 ( igf-1 , formerly known as somatomedin c ) , a hormone homologous to proinsulin igf-1 also has stimulatory effects on osteoblast and chondrocyte activity to promote bone growth the most common disease of gh excess is a pituitary tumor composed of somatotroph cells of the anterior pituitary other drugs like octreotide ( somatostatin agonist ) and bromocriptine ( dopamine agonist ) can be used to block gh secretion because both somatostatin and dopamine negatively inhibit ghrh-mediated gh release from the anterior pituitary major manifestations of gh deficiency in children are growth failure , the development of a short stature , and delayed sexual maturity diagnosis of gh deficiency involves a multiple-step diagnostic process , usually culminating in gh stimulation tests to see if the patient 's pituitary gland will release a pulse of gh when provoked by various stimuli several studies , primarily involving patients with gh deficiency , have suggested a crucial role of gh in both mental and emotional well-being and maintaining a high energy level gh in humans appears to improve cognitive function and may be useful in the treatment of patients with cognitive impairment that is a result of gh deficiency gh is used as replacement therapy in adults with gh deficiency of either childhood-onset or adult-onset ( usually as a result of an acquired pituitary tumor ) gh can be used to treat conditions that produce short stature but are not related to deficiencies in gh one version of rhgh has also been fda approved for maintaining muscle mass in wasting due to aids athletes in many sports have used human growth hormone in order to attempt to enhance their athletic performance in 1985 , biosynthetic human growth hormone replaced pituitary-derived human growth hormone for therapeutic use in the u.s
