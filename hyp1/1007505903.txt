fischer black ( 1972 ) developed another version of capm , called black capm or zero-beta capm , that does not assume the existence of a riskless asset the capm returns the asset-appropriate required return or discount rate—i.e the rate at which future cash flows produced by the asset should be discounted given that asset 's relative riskiness thus , a more risky stock will have a higher beta and will be discounted at a higher rate ; less sensitive stocks will have lower betas and be discounted at a lower rate market risk , the market as a whole , by definition , has a beta of one stock market indices are frequently used as local proxies for the market—and in that case ( by definition ) have a beta of one an investor in a large , diversified portfolio ( such as a mutual fund ) , therefore , expects performance in line with the market the risk of a portfolio comprises systematic risk , also known as undiversifiable risk , and specific risk which is also known as idiosyncratic risk or diversifiable risk systematic risk refers to the risk common to all securities—i.e unsystematic risk is the risk associated with individual assets unsystematic risk can be diversified away to smaller levels by including a greater number of assets in the portfolio ( specific risks '' average out '' ) the same is not possible for systematic risk within one market therefore , the required return on an asset , that is , the return that compensates for risk taken , must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context—i.e in the capm context , portfolio risk is represented by higher variance i.e the capm assumes that the risk-return profile of a portfolio can be optimized—an optimal portfolio displays the lowest possible level of risk for its level of return because the unsystematic risk is diversifiable , the total risk of a portfolio can be viewed as beta a critique of the traditional capm is that the risk measure used remains constant ( non-varying beta ) the model assumes that all active and potential shareholders have access to the same information and agree about the risk and expected return of all assets ( homogeneous expectations assumption ) other authors have attempted to document what the world wealth or world market portfolio consists of and what its returns have been the capital asset pricing model : some empirical tests , pp the capital asset pricing model ( capm ) , short-sale restrictions and related issues , journal of finance , 32 ( 177 ) stone , bernell k
