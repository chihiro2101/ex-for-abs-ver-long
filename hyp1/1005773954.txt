the investigation of the nucleus was done by three optical spectrometers , one microwave radio antenna and one radar : alice ( an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ) the ultraviolet spectroscopy searched for and quantified the noble gas content in the comet nucleus , from which the temperature during the comet creation could be estimated development and construction of the instrument was led by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) miro ( microwave instrument for the rosetta orbiter ) the abundance and temperature of volatile substances like water , ammonia and carbon dioxide could be detected by miro via their microwave emissions the radio antenna along with the rest of the instrument was built by nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory with international contributions by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) , among others the radar performed tomography of the nucleus by measuring electromagnetic wave propagation between the philae lander and the rosetta orbiter through the comet nucleus development was led by the laboratoire de planétologie de grenoble with contributions by the ruhr-universität boch and the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) the instrument consisted of a double-focus sector instrument ( dfms ) and a reflectron type time of flight ( rtof ) the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) has contributed to the deveplopment and construction of the instrument giada analysed the dust environment of the comet coma by measuring the optical cross section , momentum , speed and mass of each grain entering inside the instrument comets are thought to have delivered a vast quantity of water to earth , and they may have also seeded earth with organic molecules before succumbing to falling power levels , philae cosac instrument was able to detect organic molecules in the comet 's atmosphere ; amino acids upon landing on the comet , philae should have also tested some hypotheses as to why essential amino acids are almost all '' left-handed '' , which refers to how the atoms arrange in orientation in relation to the carbon core of the molecule most asymmetrical molecules are oriented in approximately equal numbers of left- and right-handed configurations ( chirality ) , and the primarily left-handed structure of essential amino acids used by living organisms is unique the virtis spectrometer on board the rosetta spacecraft has provided evidence of nonvolatile organic macromolecular compounds everywhere on the surface of comet 67p with little to no water ice visible solid organic compounds were also found in the dust particles emitted by the comet ; the carbon in this organic material is bound in '' very large macromolecular compounds '' , analogous to those found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites in turn , the philae lander 's cosac instrument detected organic molecules in the comet 's atmosphere as it descended to its surface one of the most outstanding discoveries of the mission was the detection of large amounts of free molecular oxygen gas surrounding the comet ; 2004 2 march – rosetta was successfully launched at 07:17 utc ( 04:17 local time ) from kourou , french guiana 8 november – catalina sky survey briefly misidentified the rosetta spacecraft , approaching for its second earth flyby , as a newly discovered asteroid in total eight burns were used to align the trajectories of rosetta 67p with the majority of the deceleration occurring during three burns : delta-v of on 21 may , on 4 june , and on 18 june 4 september – the first science data from rosetta alice instrument was reported , showing that the comet is unusually dark in ultraviolet wavelengths , hydrogen and oxygen are present in the coma , and no significant areas of water-ice have been found on the comet 's surface ; 2016 27 july 2016 – esa switched off the electrical support system processor unit ( ess ) aboard rosetta , disabling any possibility of further communications with the philae lander '' the film 's conception was the result of the bfi 's inquiry to the esa for a contribution to their celebration of science fiction , with the esa taking the opportunity to promote the rosetta mission through the festival on 23 september 2016 , vangelis released the studio album rosetta in honour of the mission , which was used on 30 september in the '' rosetta 's final hour '' streaming video of the esa livestream event '' rosetta grand finale ''
