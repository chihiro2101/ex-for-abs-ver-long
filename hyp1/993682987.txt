recursion theory originated in the 1930s , with work of kurt gödel , alonzo church , rózsa péter , alan turing , stephen kleene , and emil post these results led stephen kleene ( 1952 ) to coin the two names '' church 's thesis '' ( kleene 1952:300 ) and '' turing 's thesis '' ( kleene 1952:376 ) nowadays these are often considered as a single hypothesis , the church–turing thesis , which states that any function that is computable by an algorithm is a computable function in 1947 , markov and post published independent papers showing that the word problem for semigroups can not be effectively decided the study of which mathematical constructions can be effectively performed is sometimes called recursive mathematics ; the handbook of recursive mathematics ( ershov et al the main form of computability studied in recursion theory was introduced by turing ( 1936 ) a set of natural numbers is said to be a computable set ( also called a decidable , recursive , or turing computable set ) if there is a turing machine that , given a number n , halts with output 1 if n is in the set and halts with output 0 if n is not in the set a function f from the natural numbers to themselves is a recursive or ( turing ) computable function if there is a turing machine that , on input n , halts and returns output f ( n ) the use of turing machines here is not necessary ; there are many other model of computation that have the same computing power as turing machines ; for example the mu-recursive function obtained from primitive recursion and the μ operator the definition in terms of μ-recursive functions as well as a different definition of rekursiv functions by gödel led to the traditional name recursive for sets and functions computable by a turing machine not every set of natural numbers is computable the halting problem , which is the set of ( descriptions of ) turing machines that halt on input 0 , is a well-known example of a noncomputable set the existence of many noncomputable sets follows from the facts that there are only countable set turing machines , and thus only countably many computable sets , but according to the cantor 's theorem , there are uncountable set sets of natural numbers although the halting problem is not computable , it is possible to simulate program execution and produce an infinite list of the programs that do halt these are not independent areas of research : each of these areas draws ideas and results from the others , and most recursion theorists are familiar with the majority of them recursion theory in mathematical logic has traditionally focused on relative computability , a generalization of turing computability defined using oracle turing machines , introduced by turing & nbsp ; ( 1939 ) each question will be immediately answered correctly , even if the oracle set is not computable informally , a set of natural numbers a is turing reduction to a set b if there is an oracle machine that correctly tells whether numbers are in a when run with b as the oracle set ( in this case , the set a is also said to be ( relatively ) computable from b and recursive in b ) if a set a is turing reducible to a set b and b is turing reducible to a then the sets are said to have the same turing degree ( also called degree of unsolvability ) the natural examples of sets that are not computable , including many different sets that encode variants of the halting problem , have two properties in common : they are recursively enumerable , and each can be translated into any other via a many-one reduction that is , given such sets a and b , there is a total computable function f such that a has the property that either the halting problem or its complement is many-one reducible to e , that is , can be mapped using a many-one reduction to e ( see rice 's theorem for more detail ) the index sets given here are even complete for their levels , that is , all the sets in these levels can be many-one reduced to the given index sets the weakest such axiom studied in reverse mathematics is recursive comprehension , which states that the powerset of the naturals is closed under turing reducibility numberings can be partial-recursive although some of its members are total recursive , that is , computable functions later research dealt also with numberings of other classes like classes of recursively enumerable sets maximal sets ( as defined in the previous paragraph ) have the property that they can not be automorphic to non-maximal sets , that is , if there is an automorphism of the recursive enumerable sets under the structure just mentioned , then every maximal set is mapped to another maximal set such sets are known as ( m , & nbsp ; n ) -recursive sets gödel 's proofs show that the set of logical consequences of an effective first-order theory is a recursively enumerable set , and that if the theory is strong enough this set will be uncomputable according to rogers , the sets of interest in recursion theory are the noncomputable sets , partitioned into equivalence classes by computable bijections of the natural numbers
