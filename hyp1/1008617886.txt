researchers trace the origins of the blade back to the domestic sickle and the prehistoric bent stick used for hunting and later in hand-to-hand combat similar implements have existed in several forms throughout the indian subcontinent and were used both as weapons and as tools , such as for sacrificial rituals the kukri came to be known to the western world when the east india company came into conflict with the growing gorkha kingdom , culminating in the gurkha war of 1814â€“1816 all gurkha troops are issued with two kukris , a service no.1 ( ceremonial ) and a service no.2 ( exercise ) ; in modern times members of the brigade of gurkhas receive training in its use the weapon gained fame in the gurkha war and its continued use through both world war i and world war ii enhanced its reputation among both allied troops and enemy forces elsewhere during the second world war , the kukri was purchased and used by other british , commonwealth and us troops training in india , including the chindits and merrill 's marauders as a general guide the spines vary from at the handle , and can taper to by the point while the blade lengths can vary from for general use the handle quite often has a flared butt that allows better retention in draw cuts and chopping most handles have metal bolsters and butt plates which are generally made of brass or steel the traditional handle attachment in nepal is the partial tang , although the more modern versions have the stick tang which has become popular traditionally , the scabbard also holds two smaller blades : an unsharpened checkmark to burnish the blade , and another accessory blade called a karda modern kukri blades are often forged from spring steel , sometimes collected from recycled suspension ( vehicle ) the tang of the blade usually extends all the way through to the end of the handle ; the small portion of the tang that projects through the end of the handle are hammered flat to secure the blade in more modern kukri , handles of cast aluminium or brass are press-fitted to the tang ; as the hot metal cools it shrinks , locking onto the blade traditional profiling of the blade edge is performed by a two-man team ; one spins a grinding wheel forwards and backwards by means of a rope wound several times around an axle while the sharpener applies the blade the wheel is made by hand from fine river sand bound by laha , the same adhesive used to affix the handle to the blade routine sharpening is traditionally accomplished by passing a chakmak over the edge in a manner similar to that used by chefs to steel their knives while most famed from use in the military , the kukri is the most commonly used multipurpose tool in the fields and homes in nepal butt cap ( chapri ) : thick metal/brass plate used to secure the handle to the tang upper edge ( mathillo bhaag ) : spine of the scabbard where holding should be done when handling a kukri there is khukuri named after gorkhali general amar singh thapa called amar singh thapa khukuri the real khukuri used by amar singh thapa is archived at national museum of nepal and is more curvy in nature than other traditions
