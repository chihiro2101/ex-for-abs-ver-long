the main organs involved in urination are the urinary bladder and the urethra the smooth muscle of the bladder , known as the detrusor , is innervated by sympathetic nervous system fibers from the lumbar spinal cord and parasympathetic fibers from the sacrum spinal cord fibers in the pelvic nerves constitute the main afferent limb of the voiding reflex ; the parasympathetic fibers to the bladder that constitute the excitatory efferent limb also travel in these nerves part of the urethra is surrounded by the male or female external urethral sphincter , which is innervated by the somatic pudendal nerve originating in the cord , in an area termed onuf 's nucleus smooth muscle bundles pass on either side of the urethra , and these fibers are sometimes called the internal urethral sphincter , although they do not encircle the urethra when the bladder is fully distended the superficial cells become squamous ( flat ) and the stratification of the cuboidal cells is reduced in order to provide lateral stretching micturition is fundamentally a spinobulbospinal reflex facilitated and inhibited by higher brain centers such as the pontine micturition center and , like defecation , subject to voluntary facilitation and inhibition in healthy individuals , the lower urinary tract has two discrete phases of activity : the storage ( or guarding ) phase , when urine is stored in the bladder ; and the voiding phase , when urine is released through the urethra the state of the reflex system is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra at low bladder volumes , afferent firing is low , resulting in excitation of the outlet ( the sphincter and urethra ) , and relaxation of the bladder at high bladder volumes , afferent firing increases , causing a conscious sensation of urinary urge when the individual is ready to urinate , he or she consciously initiates voiding , causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax voiding continues until the bladder empties completely , at which point the bladder relaxes and the outlet contracts to re-initiate storage during micturition , parasympathetic stimulation causes the detrusor muscle to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to relax the external urethral sphincter ( sphincter urethrae ) is under somatic control and is consciously relaxed during micturition in the adult , the volume of urine in the bladder that normally initiates a reflex contraction is about a plot of bladder ( intravesical ) pressure against the depressant of fluid in the bladder ( called a cystometrogram ) , will show a very slight rise as the bladder is filled this phenomenon is a manifestation of the law of laplace , which states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius action potentials carried by sensory neurons from stretch receptors in the urinary bladder wall travel to the sacral segments of the spinal cord through the pelvic nerves since bladder wall stretch is low during the storage phase , these afferent neurons fire at low frequencies low-frequency afferent signals cause relaxation of the bladder by inhibiting sacral parasympathetic preganglionic neurons and exciting lumbar sympathetic preganglionic neurons voiding begins when a voluntary signal is sent from the brain to begin urination , and continues until the bladder is empty at a certain level of afferent activity , the conscious urge to void becomes difficult to ignore the firing of these neurons causes the wall of the bladder to contract ; as a result , a sudden , sharp rise in intravesical pressure occurs when the external urinary sphincter is relaxed urine is released from the urinary bladder when the pressure there is great enough to force urine to flow out of the urethra the micturition reflex normally produces a series of contractions of the urinary bladder the flow of urine through the urethra has an overall excitatory role in micturition , which helps sustain voiding until the bladder is empty elsevier after urination , the female urethra empties partially by gravity , with assistance from muscles for land mammals over 1 kilogram , the duration of urination does not vary with body mass , being dispersed around an average of 21 seconds ( standard deviation 13 seconds ) , despite a 4 order of magnitude ( 1000Ã— ) difference in bladder volume for smaller mammals a different phenomenon occurs , where urine is discharged as droplets , and urination in smaller mammals , such as mice and rats , can occur in less than a second after transection of the brain stem just above the pons , the threshold is lowered and less bladder filling is required to trigger it , whereas after transection at the top of the midbrain , the threshold for the reflex is essentially normal the bladder can be made to contract by voluntary facilitation of the spinal voiding reflex when it contains only a few milliliters of urine in females the need to urinate is felt in the lower abdomen region when the bladder is full when the bladder becomes too full , the sphincter muscles will involuntarily relax , allowing urine to pass from the bladder bladder sphincter dyssynergia , a discoordination between the bladder and external urethral sphincter as a result of brain or spinal cord injury a drug that increases urination is called a diuretic , whereas antidiuretics decrease the production of urine by the kidneys paruresis , also known as shy bladder syndrome , is an example of a bladder interruption from the brain that often causes total interruption until the person has left a public area when the sacral dorsal roots are cut in experimental animals or interrupted by diseases of the dorsal roots such as tabes dorsalis in humans , all reflex contractions of the bladder are abolished gradually , however , the muscle of the '' decentralized bladder '' becomes active , with many contraction waves that expel dribbles of urine out of the urethra the bladder becomes shrunken and the bladder wall hypertrophied it becomes overfilled , and urine dribbles through the sphincters ( overflow incontinence ) the reflex hyperactivity is made worse , and may be caused , by infection in the bladder wall elderly males with prostate gland enlargement may benefit from sitting down while in healthy males , no difference is found in the ability to urinate for practising muslim men , the genital modesty of squatting is also associated with proper cleanliness requirements or awrah an alternative method for women to urinate standing is to use a tool known as a female urination device to assist a common technique used in many undeveloped nations involves holding the child by the backs of the thighs , above the ground , facing outward , in order to urinate occasionally , if a male 's penis is damaged or removed , or a female 's genitals/urinary tract is damaged , other urination techniques must be used most often in such cases , doctors will reposition the urethra to a location where urination can still be accomplished , usually in a position that would promote urination only while seated/squatting , though a permanent urinary catheter may be used in rare cases resisting the urge to urinate because of lack of facilities can promote urinary tract infections which can lead to more serious infections and , in rare situations , can cause renal damage in women the male 's urination is meant to repel other males from his partner while the female 's urination is a rejection of any approaching male when she is not receptive domestic dogs mark their territories by urinating on vertical surfaces ( usually at nose level ) , sometimes marking over the urine of other dogs breeding pairs of wolves will sometimes urinate on the same spot : this is known as '' double-marking '' to identify their territories , male tigers mark trees by spraying urine and anal gland secretions , as well as marking trails with scat
