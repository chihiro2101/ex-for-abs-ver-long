the frankish carolingian empire and the frisians fought for control of the territory , until the franks gained control of the frisian coast in 719 dorestad flourished between the 7th century and the mid-9th century the settlement was well known for minting coins under the control of several frankish rulers in the 7th century , it was clear that dorestad had the potential to become a major port as a result , the franks and the frisians fought over control of the township the franks won out at the end of the 7th century and closely monitored the growth of dorestad , which led to dorestad 's economic expansion via international trade and the establishment of a mint in the upper town it is assumed that there was a toll as well as harbour fees , collected by the king 's representatives at dorestad it seems that the expansion of dorestad , lower town in particular , lasted until the early 9th century , when the strength of the international trade of luxury items was weakened by the rise of regional trade as a result , the franks slowly lost interest in the town and granted the church of utrecht responsibility over a sizeable portion of dorestad it is thought that the decline occurred because of viking raids as well as a decline in the economy however , lothair i was unable to protect dorestad and the other frankish territories from economic turmoil as a result , louis the pious quickly took back dorestad and exiled his son to italy the second was that lothair i was stirring up trouble for the franks by encouraging viking raids on the frisian coast when he was exiled although dorestad was raided only once , in 834 , it seems that the town never fully recovered afterwards the coast was battered by viking attacks , but it seems that dorestad was left relatively unscathed by the 9th century , it seems that the need for international trade was waning as regional trade gained importance under danish control , dorestad became less significant because of its wealth and success as a trade centre , dorestad got the attention of vikings in the 9th century the throne of denmark was briefly under control of the son of halfdan , harald klak , but he was driven away by the sons of godfred this resulted in dorestad undergoing many attacks and lootings until louis and lothair came to terms in worms in 839 the valuable piece of jewellery may have been placed in the well to protect it from danger , for example the attacks of the vikings on dorestad only the '' lower town '' was excavated by archaeologists as much of dorestad was eroded away by the river bend
