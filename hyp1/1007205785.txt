although usually not cost-effective , glycerol can be produced by various routes from propene chlorine-free processes from propylene include the synthesis of glycerol from acrolein and propylene oxide : because of the large-scale production of biodiesel from fats , where glycerol is a waste product , the market for glycerol is depressed owing to oversupply , efforts are being made to convert glycerol to synthetic precursors , such as acrolein and epichlorohydrin in food and beverages , glycerol serves as a humectant , solvent , and sweetener , and may help preserve foods it is also used as filler in commercially prepared low-fat foods ( e.g glycerol and water are used to preserve certain types of plant leaves as a sugar substitute , it has approximately 27 food energy per teaspoon ( sugar has 20 ) and is 60 % as sweet as sucrose as a food additive , glycerol is labeled as e number e422 as used in foods , glycerol is categorized by the u.s food and drug administration ( fda ) carbohydrate designation includes all caloric macronutrients excluding protein and fat due to this it is used widely in wound care products , including glycerin based hydrogel sheets for burns and other wound care it is approved for all types of wound care except third degree burns , and is used to package donor skin used in skin grafts there is no topical treatment approved for third degree burns , and so this limitation is not exclusive to glycerin glycerol is used in medical , pharmaceutical and personal care preparations , often as a means of improving smoothness , providing lubrication , and as a humectant glycerol is also used in blood banking to preserve red blood cells prior to freezing glycerol has also been incorporated as a component of bio-ink formulations in the field of bioprinting when utilized in '' tincture '' method extractions , specifically as a 10 % solution , glycerol prevents tannins from precipitating in ethanol extracts of plants ( tinctures ) it is also used as an '' alcohol-free '' alternative to ethanol as a solvent in preparing herbal extractions alcohol-based tinctures can also have the alcohol removed and replaced with glycerol for its preserving properties that glycerol possesses such high extractive power assumes it is utilized with dynamic ( i.e ( 1928 ) glycerol and the glycols â€“ production , properties and analysis the minimum freezing point temperature is about corresponding to 70 % glycerol in water glycerol was historically used as an anti-freeze for automotive applications before being replaced by ethylene glycol , which has a lower freezing point research has been conducted to produce value-added products from glycerol obtained from biodiesel production glycerol injections can be used as a simple test for liver damage , as its rate of absorption by the liver is considered an accurate measure of liver health direct glycerol treatment of testes has been found to cause significant long-term reduction in sperm count
