the history of group dynamics ( or group processes ) has a consistent , underlying premise : 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts ' a social group is an entity that has qualities which can not be understood just by studying the individuals that make up the group as a field of study , group dynamics has roots in both psychology and sociology ( the concept of a collective consciousness is not essential to group dynamics eventually , the social psychology kurt lewin ( 1890–1947 ) coined the term group dynamics to describe the positive and negative forces within groups of people throughout his career , lewin was focused on how the study of group dynamics could be applied to real-world , social issues increasingly , research has applied evolutionary psychology principles to group dynamics as humans social environments became more complex , they acquired adaptations by way of group dynamics that enhance survival examples include mechanisms for dealing with status , reciprocity , identifying cheaters , ostracism , altruism , group decision , leadership , and intergroup relations gustave le bon was a french social psychologist whose seminal study , the crowd : a study of the popular mind ( 1896 ) led to the development of group psychology the british psychologist william mcdougall in his work the group mind ( 1920 ) researched the dynamics of groups of various sizes and degrees of organization in group psychology and the analysis of the ego , ( 1922 ) , sigmund freud based his preliminary description of group psychology on le bon 's work , but went on to develop his own , original theory , related to what he had begun to elaborate in totem and taboo kurt lewin ( 1943 , 1948 , 1951 ) is commonly identified as the founder of the movement to study groups scientifically he coined the term group dynamics to describe the way groups and individuals act and react to changing circumstances this model refers to the overall pattern of the group , but of course individuals within a group work in different ways ( 1987 ) the different drum : community-making and peace.p these include : being a real team : which results from having a shared task , clear boundaries which clarify who is inside or outside of the group , and stability in group membership enabling structure : which results from having tasks which have variety , a group size that is not too large , talented group members who have at least moderate social skill , and strong norms that specify appropriate behaviour supportive context : which occurs in groups nested in larger groups ( e.g intragroup dynamics ( also referred to as ingroup- , within-group , or commonly just ‘ group dynamics ’ ) are the underlying processes that give rise to a set of norms , roles , relations , and common goals that characterize a particular social group examples of groups include religious , political , military , and environmental groups , sports teams , work groups , and therapy groups amongst the members of a group , there is a state of interdependence , through which the behaviours , attitudes , opinions , and experiences of each member are collectively influenced by the other group members residents ( ‘ americans ’ ) as a group , but could also define a more specific set of u.s south that sustain a culture of honor , which is associated with norms of toughness , honour-related violence , and self-defence additionally , from the social identity approach , group formation involves both identifying with some individuals and explicitly not identifying with others through interaction , individuals begin to develop group norms , roles , and attitudes which define the group , and are internalized to influence behaviour group membership , allocated roles ) or prior experience working together joining a group is determined by a number of different factors , including an individual 's personal traits ; gender ; social motives such as need for affiliation , need for power , and need for intimacy ; attachment style ; and prior group experiences it also offers friendship , potential new interests , learning new skills , and enhancing self esteem those individuals who have experienced positive rewards with few costs in previous relationships and groups will have a higher comparison level than a person who experienced more negative costs and fewer rewards in previous relationships and group memberships as well , group membership will be unsatisfying to a new member if the outcomes are below the individual 's comparison level this comparison level for alternatives is the standard by which an individual will evaluate the quality of the group in comparison to other groups the individual has the opportunity to join thiabaut and kelley stated that the '' comparison level for alternatives can be defined informally as the lowest level of outcomes a member will accept in the light of available alternative opportunities if membership in the group is above the comparison level for alternatives but below the comparison level , membership will be not be satisfactory ; however , the individual will likely join the group since no other desirable options are available when group membership is below the comparison level for alternatives but above the comparison level , membership is satisfying but an individual will be unlikely to join if group membership is below both the comparison and alternative comparison levels , membership will be dissatisfying and the individual will be less likely to join the group for example , three best friends who interact every day as well as a collection of people watching a movie in a theater both constitute a group it is important to define these four types of groups because they are intuitive to most lay people for example , in an experiment , participants were asked to sort a number of groups into categories based on their own criteria it was found that participants consistently sorted groups into four categories : intimacy groups , task groups , loose associations , and social categories primary groups are characterized by relatively small , long-lasting groups of individuals who share personally meaningful relationships since these groups often interact face-to-face , they know each other very well and are unified individuals that are a part of primary groups consider the group to be an important part of their lives consequently , members strongly identify with their group , even without regular meetings examples of primary groups include family , close friends , and gangs a social group is characterized by a formally organized group of individuals who are not as emotionally involved with each other as those in a primary group examples of social groups include coworkers , clubs , and sports teams collectives are characterized by large groups of individuals who display similar actions or outlooks categories are characterized by a collection of individuals who are similar in some way categories become groups when their similarities have social implications the degree of entitativity that a group has is influenced by whether a collection of individuals experience the same fate , display similarities , and are close in proximity examples of categories are new yorkers , gamblers , and women in contrast , one 's social identity is defined by his or her group membership , and the general characteristics ( or prototypes ) that define the group and differentiate it from others instead , we make evaluations that are self-enhancing , emphasizing the positive qualities of our own group ( see ingroup bias ) optimal distinctiveness theory suggests that individuals have a desire to be similar to others , but also a desire to differentiate themselves , ultimately seeking some balance of these two desires ( to obtain optimal distinctiveness ) it is thought to be one of the most important characteristics of a group , and has been linked to group performance , group conflict and therapeutic change group cohesion , as a scientifically studied property of groups , is commonly associated with kurt lewin and his student , leon festinger later , this definition was modified to describe the forces acting on individual members to remain in the group , termed attraction to the group for example , emile durkheim described two forms of solidarity ( mechanical and organic ) , which created a sense of collective conscious and an emotion-based sense of community beliefs within the ingroup are based on how individuals in the group see their other members they are a fundamental aspect of group structure as they provide direction and motivation , and organize the social interactions of members analysing the intermember relations aspect of a group can highlight the degree centrality of each member in the group , which can lead to a better understanding of the roles of certain group ( e.g according to social identity theory , intergroup conflict starts with a process of comparison between individuals in one group ( the ingroup ) to those of another group ( the outgroup )
