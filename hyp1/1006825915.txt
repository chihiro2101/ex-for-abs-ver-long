the concept of reconfigurable computing has existed since the 1960s , when gerald estrin 's paper proposed the concept of a computer made of a standard processor and an array of '' reconfigurable '' hardware the main processor would control the behavior of the reconfigurable hardware bobda : introduction to reconfigurable computing : architectures ; springer , 2007 such as : copacobana , matrix , garp , hauser , john r and wawrzynek , john , '' garp : a mips processor with a reconfigurable coprocessor '' , proceedings of the ieee symposium on field-programmable custom computing machines ( fccm '97 , april 16â€“18 , 1997 ) , pp the world 's first commercial reconfigurable computer , the algotronix chs2x4 , was completed in 1991 it was not a commercial success , but was promising enough that xilinx ( the inventor of the fpga , fpga ) bought the technology and hired the algotronix staff tredennick : the case for reconfigurable computing ; microprocessor report , vol high-performance reconfigurable computing ( hprc ) is a computer architecture combining reconfigurable computing-based accelerators like field-programmable gate array with cpus or multi-core processors the increase of logic in an fpga has enabled larger and more complex algorithms to be programmed into the fpga this has brought reconfigurable computing into the high-performance computing sphere this heterogeneous systems technique is used in computing research and especially in supercomputing the us national science foundation has a center for high-performance reconfigurable computing ( chrec ) commercial high-performance reconfigurable computing systems are beginning to emerge with the announcement of ibm integrating fpgas with its power processor in many cases it is useful to be able to swap out one or several of these subcomponents while the fpga is still operating partial reconfiguration allows for critical parts of the design to continue operating while a controller either on the fpga or off of it loads a partial design into a reconfigurable module partial reconfiguration also can be used to save space for multiple designs by only storing the partial designs that change between designs a common example for when partial reconfiguration would be useful is the case of a communication device the quartus prime pro software also support hierarchical partial reconfiguration and simulation of partial reconfiguration in a typical reconfigurable system , a bit stream is used to program the device at deployment time partial re-configuration allows smaller reconfigurable bit streams thus not wasting energy on transmitting redundant information in the bit stream often the reconfigurable array is used as a processing accelerator attached to a host processor the flexibility in reconfigurable devices mainly comes from their routing interconnect
