critical chain project management is based on methods and algorithms derived from theory of constraints goldratt 's book , critical chain according to studies of traditional project management methods by standish group and others as of 1998 , only 44 % of projects typically finish on time harvey maylor , project management in a project plan , the critical chain is the sequence of both precedence- and resource-dependent tasks that prevents a project from being completed in a shorter time , given finite resources if resources are always available in unlimited quantities , then a project 's critical chain is identical to its critical path method critical chain project management uses buffer management instead of earned value management to assess the performance of a project some project managers feel that the earned value management technique is misleading , because it does not distinguish progress on the project constraint ( i.e a project plan or work breakdown structure ( wbs ) is created in much the same fashion as with critical path in 1999 , a researcher applied simulation to assess the impact of risks associated with each component of project work breakdown structure on project duration , cost and performance when the plan is complete and the project is ready to start , the project network is fixed and the buffers ' sizes are '' locked '' ( i.e , their planned duration may not be altered during the project ) , because they are used to monitor project schedule and financial performance because task duration has been planned at the 50 % probability duration , there is pressure on resources to complete critical chain tasks as quickly as possible , overcoming student 's syndrome and parkinson 's law
