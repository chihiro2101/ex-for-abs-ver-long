by contrast , most of the macrophages that accumulate at diseased sites typically derive from circulating monocytes when a monocyte enters damaged tissue through the endothelium of a blood vessel , a process known as leukocyte extravasation , it undergoes a series of changes to become a macrophage monocytes are attracted to a damaged site by chemical substances through chemotaxis , triggered by a range of stimuli including damaged cells , pathogens and cytokines released by macrophages already at the site at some sites such as the testis , macrophages have been shown to populate the organ through proliferation unlike short-lived neutrophils , macrophages survive longer in the body , up to several months file : phagocytosis zp.svg thumb right 400px steps of a macrophage ingesting a pathogen : a macrophages are professional phagocytes and are highly specialized in removal of dying or dead cells and cellular debris this role is important in chronic inflammation , as the early stages of inflammation are dominated by neutrophils , which are ingested by macrophages if they come of age ( see cd31 for a description of this process ) the neutrophils are at first attracted to a site , where they perform their function and die , before they are phagocytized by the macrophages when at the site , the first wave of neutrophils , after the process of aging and after the first 48 hours , stimulate the appearance of the macrophages whereby these macrophages will then ingest the aged neutrophils along with dendritic cells , they are foremost among the cells that present antigens , a crucial role in initiating an immune response as secretory cells , monocytes and macrophages are vital to the regulation of immune responses and the development of inflammation ; they produce a wide array of powerful chemical substances ( monokines ) including enzymes , complement proteins , and regulatory factors such as interleukin-1 at the same time , they carry receptors for lymphokines that allow them to be '' activated '' into single-minded pursuit of microbes and tumour cells after digesting a pathogen , a macrophage will present the antigen ( a molecule , most often a protein found on the surface of the pathogen and used by the immune system for identification ) of the pathogen to the corresponding helper t cell the presentation is done by integrating it into the cell membrane and displaying it attached to an mhc class ii molecule ( mhcii ) , indicating to other white blood cells that the macrophage is not a pathogen , despite having antigens on its surface the antigen presentation on the surface of infected macrophages ( in the context of mhc class ii ) in a lymph node stimulates th1 ( type 1 helper t cells ) to proliferate ( mainly due to il-12 secretion from the macrophage ) t cells that express the t cell receptor which recognizes the antigen-mhcii complex ( with co-stimulatory factors- cd40 and cd40l ) cause the b-cell to produce antibodies that help opsonisation of the antigen so that the bacteria can be better cleared by phagocytes macrophages provide yet another line of defense against tumor cells and somatic cells infected with fungus or parasites m1 macrophages : as mentioned earlier ( previously referred to as classically activated macrophages ) , m1 '' killer '' macrophages are activated by lps and ifn-gamma , and secrete high levels of il-12 and low levels of il-10 these mediator molecules create a pro-inflammatory response that in return produce pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 and tnf m2 macrophages are divided into four major types based on their roles : m2a , m2b , m2c , and m2d there is a phenotype shift from m1 to m2 macrophages in acute wounds , however this shift is impaired for chronic wounds this dysregulation results in insufficient m2 macrophages and its corresponding growth factors that aid in wound repair with a lack of these growth factors/anti-inflammatory cytokines and an overabundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines from m1 macrophages chronic wounds are unable to heal in a timely manner the first step to understanding the importance of macrophages in muscle repair , growth , and regeneration is that there are two '' waves '' of macrophages with the onset of damageable muscle use & nbsp ; â€“ subpopulations that do and do not directly have an influence on repairing muscle these early-invading , phagocytic macrophages reach their highest concentration about 24 hours following the onset of some form of muscle cell injury or reloading attracted to the wound site by growth factors released by platelets and other cells , monocytes from the bloodstream enter the area through blood vessel walls once they are in the wound site , monocytes mature into macrophages the macrophage 's main role is to phagocytize bacteria and damaged tissue , and they also debride damaged tissue by releasing proteases macrophages are stimulated by the low oxygen content of their surroundings to produce factors that induce and speed angiogenesis and they also stimulate cells that re-epithelialize the wound , create granulation tissue , and lay down a new extracellular matrix by secreting these factors , macrophages contribute to pushing the wound healing process into the next phase scientists have elucidated that as well as eating up material debris , macrophages are involved in the typical limb regeneration in the salamander as described above , macrophages play a key role in removing dying or dead cells and cellular debris melanophages are a subset of tissue-resident macrophages able to absorb pigment , either native to the organism or exogenous ( such as tattoos ) , from extracellular space legionella pneumophila , the causative agent of legionnaires ' disease , also establishes residence within macrophages for example , macrophages may have cytotoxic activity to kill tumor cells directly ; also the co-operation of t-cells and macrophages is important to suppress tumors because macrophages can regulate tumor progression , therapeutic strategies to reduce the number of these cells , or to manipulate their phenotypes , are currently being tested in cancer patients like macrophages , intestinal macrophages are differentiated monocytes , though intestinal macrophages have to coexist with the microbiota in the intestines there has yet to be a determined mechanism for the alteration of the intestinal macrophages by recruitment of new monocytes or changes in the already present intestinal macrophages
