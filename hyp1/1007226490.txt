quorum sensing was first reported in 1970 , by kenneth nealson , terry platt , and j some of the best-known examples of quorum sensing come from studies of bacteria bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate certain phenotype expressions , which in turn , coordinate their behaviours certain bacteria are able to use quorum sensing to regulate bioluminescence , nitrogen fixation and spore both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria use quorum sensing , but there are some major differences in their mechanisms for the bacteria to use quorum sensing constitutively , they must possess three characteristics : to secrete a signaling molecule , an autoinducer , to detect the change in concentration of signaling molecules , and to regulate gene transcription as a response this process is highly dependent on the diffusion mechanism of the signaling molecules qs signaling molecules are usually secreted at a low level by individual bacteria at high cell density , the local concentration of signaling molecules may exceed its threshold level , and trigger changes in gene expression the kinase phosphorylates a transcription factor , which regulates gene transcription gram-negative bacteria produce n-acyl homoserine lactone ( ahl ) as their signaling molecule some gram-negative bacteria may use the two-component system as well fischeri bioluminescence is regulated by ahls ( n-acyl-homoserine lactones ) which is a product of the luxi gene whose transcription is regulated by the luxr activator moreover , a study showed that these host associated curvibacter bacteria produce a broad spectrum of ahl , explaining the presence of those operons as mentioned before , ahl are the quorum sensing molecules of gram-negative bacteria , which means curvibacter has a quorum sensing activity indeed , due to the oxidoreductase activity of hydra , there is a modification of ahl signalling molecules ( 3-oxo-homoserine lactone into 3-hydroxy-homoserine lactone ) which leads to a different host-microbe interaction yet , flagellin , the main protein component of flagella , can act as an immunomodulator and activate the innate immune response in hydra another explanation is that 3-hydroxy-hsl induces carbon metabolism and fatty acid degradation genes in hydra coli ) , cell division may be partially regulated by ai-2-mediated quorum sensing part of it encodes an abc transporter , which imports ai-2 into the cells during the early stationery ( latent ) phase of growth coli will lose the ability to internalize ai-2 ( because of catabolite repression ) however , they have a receptor that detects ahls from other bacteria and change their gene expression in accordance with the presence of other '' quorate '' populations of gram-negative bacteria sdia detects ahls produced by other species of bacteria including aeromonas hydrophila , hafnia alvei , and yersinia enterocolitica however , sdia does become activated when salmonella transits through turtles colonized with aeromonas hydrophila or mice infected with yersinia enterocolitica the opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa uses quorum sensing to coordinate the formation of biofilm , swarming motility , exopolysaccharide production , virulence , and cell aggregation these bacteria can grow within a host without harming it until they reach a threshold concentration recent studies have discovered that anaerobiosis can significantly impact the major regulatory circuit of quorum sensing this important link between quorum sensing and anaerobiosis has a significant impact on the production of virulence factors of this organism disrupting the signaling process in this way is called quorum sensing inhibition shows both quorum sensing and quorum quenching activity it produces ahls and also , it can degrade the ahl molecules as well this bacterium was previously considered a fish pathogen , but it has recently emerged as a human pathogen have been isolated from various infected sites from patients ( bile , blood , peritoneal fluid , pus , stool and urine ) it has been documented that aeromonas sobria has produced c6-hsl and two additional ahls with n-acyl side chain longer than c6 '' farnesol is used by the fungus candida albicans as a quorum sensing molecule that inhibits filamentation those bacteria produce 3-oxo-hsl quorum sensing molecules scouts that are still tandem-running to other potential sites are also recruited to the new nest , and the entire colony moves the quorum sensing process in honey bees is similar to the method used by temnothorax ants in several ways ad-hoc wireless networks can also benefit from quorum sensing , by allowing the system to detect and respond to network conditions cell signaling collective behavior interspecies quorum sensing microbial intelligence pheromone signal transduction swarm intelligence
