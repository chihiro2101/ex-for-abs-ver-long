before the introduction of digital printing technology , production of small numbers of publications had many limitations large print jobs were not a problem , but small numbers of printed pages were typically during the early 20th century produced using stencils and reproducing on a mimeograph or similar machine and to print on a teletypewriter , line printer or other computer printer , but the software and hardware to produce original good-quality printed colour text and graphics and to print small jobs fast and cheaply was unavailable print on demand with digital technology is a way to print items for a fixed cost per copy , regardless of the size of the order while the unit price of each physical copy is greater than with offset printing , the average cost is lower for very small print jobs , because setup costs are much greater for offset printing pod has other business benefits besides lesser costs ( for small jobs ) : technical set-up is usually quicker than for offset printing many publishers use pod for other printing needs other than books such as galley proof , catalogs and review copies digital technology is ideally suited to publish small print jobs of posters ( often as a single copy ) when they are needed pod creates a new category of publishing ( or printing ) company that offers services , usually for a fee , directly to authors who wish to self-publish these services generally include printing and shipping each individual book ordered , handling royalties , and getting listings in online bookstores other services may also be available , including formatting , proofreading , and editing , but such companies typically do not spend money for marketing , unlike conventional publishers while amateur/professional writers are targeted as early adopters by companies like infinity publishing and trafford publishing , there is an effort presently to make pod more mass-market among traditional publishers , pod services can be used to make sure that books remain available when one print job has sold out , but another has not yet become available pod allows a publisher to use cheaper conventional printing to produce enough copies to satisfy a pessimistic forecast of the publication sales , and then rely on pod to make up the difference because the per-unit cost is typically greater with pod than with a print job of thousands of copies , it is common for pod books to be more expensive than similar books made by conventional print jobs , especially if a book is produced exclusively with pod instead of using pod as a supplemental technology between print jobs wholesalers obtain their books in two ways : either as a special order such that the book is ordered direct from a publisher when a book store requests a copy , or as stocked , which they keep in their own warehouse as part of their inventory
