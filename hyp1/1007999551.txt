in biblical hebrew , the idea of repentance is represented by two verbs : שוב shuv ( to return ) and נחם nacham ( to feel sorrow ) in the new testament , the word translated as 'repentance ' is the greek word μετάνοια ( metanoia ) , '' after/behind one 's mind '' , which is a compound word of the preposition 'meta ' ( after , with ) , and the verb 'noeo ' ( to perceive , to think , the result of perceiving or observing ) metanoia is therefore primarily an after-thought , different from the former thought ; a change of mind and change of conduct , '' change of mind and heart '' , or , '' change of consciousness '' the doctrine of repentance as taught in the bible is a call to persons to make a radical turn from one way of life to another the repentance ( metanoia ) called for throughout the bible is a summons to a personal , absolute and ultimate unconditional surrender to god as sovereign 118-119 it is a change of mind that involves a conscious turning away from wrong actions , attitudes and thoughts that conflict with a godly lifestyle and biblical commands , and an intentional turning toward doing that which the bible says pleases god many rabbinic sources state that repentance is of paramount importance to the existence of this world , so that it was one of the seven provisions which god made before the creation ' & nbsp ; '' jerusalem talmud sanhedrin 28b '' great is repentance : it brings healing into the world '' ; '' it reaches to the throne of the lord '' ; '' it brings redemption '' ; '' it prolongs man 's life '' ; talmud yoma 86a ) '' repentance and works of charity are man 's intercessors before god 's throne '' buber , 25:158 ; midrash leviticus rabbah 7 ; talmud sanhedrin 43b ) sincere repentance is manifested when the same temptation to sin , under the same conditions , is ever after resolutely resisted ( talmud taanith 16a ; mishneh torah teshuva 2:3 ) according to jewish doctrine , repentance is the prerequisite of atonement talmud rosh hashan 18a ; mishneh torah teshuva 2:6 repentance and the day of atonement only absolve one from sins committed against god ; from sins against another person they absolve only when restitution has been made and the pardon of the offended party has been obtained talmud yoma 87a ; mishneh torah teshuva2:9 no one need despair on account of his or her sins , for every penitent sinner is graciously received by god ( talmud bava metsia 58b ; mishneh torah teshuva 8:8 ) repentance occupies a prominent position in all the ethical writings of the middle ages one of the most significant medieval works on repentance is '' shaarei teshuva , '' the '' gates of repentance '' by yonah gerondi in the first case , the manifestation of repentance consists in : ( 1 ) confession of one 's sin before god , the essential part being a solemn promise and firm resolve not to commit the same sin again however , the prophets disparaged all such outer manifestations of repentance , insisting rather on a complete change of the sinner 's mental and spiritual attitude see the description of repentance in the hebrew bible above for repentance in the old testament even in a non-religious context , the greek word μετάνοια ( metanoia ) , in particular , meant '' change of mind or heart , repentance '' or , in rhetoric , '' afterthought , correction '' in the second place , we represented repentance as proceeding from a serious fear of god '' at-tahriim 66:8 although repentance is considered as one act that can be used for cleansing the sins , the quran notes that all of the sins are forgiven with or without repentance except the state of shirk , i.e the believing person must repent for shirk sin and seek the forgiveness of allah
