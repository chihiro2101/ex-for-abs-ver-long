he attributed that to either the absorption of light within the galaxy or to modified dynamics in the outer portions of the spiral and not to any form of missing matter a companion paper by maarten schmidt showed that this rotation curve could be fit by a flattened mass distribution more extensive than the light these results suggested that either gravity does not apply universally or that , conservatively , upwards of 50 % of the mass of galaxies was contained in the relatively dark galactic halo it is also observed that galaxies with a uniform distribution of luminous matter have a rotation curve that rises from the center to the edge , and most low-surface-brightness galaxy ( lsb galaxies ) have the same anomalous rotation curve the rotation curves might be explained by hypothesizing the existence of a substantial amount of matter permeating the galaxy outside of the central bulge that is not emitting light in the mass-to-light ratio of the central bulge in order to accommodate a flat rotation curve , a density profile for a galaxy and its environs must be different than one that is centrally concentrated since observations of galaxy rotation do not match the distribution expected from application of kepler 's laws , they do not match the distribution of luminous matter this implies that spiral galaxies contain large amounts of dark matter or , in alternative , the existence of exotic physics in action on galactic scales dark matter is believed to dominate the gravitational potential of galaxies and clusters of galaxies so , while state-of-the-art cosmological and galaxy formation simulations of dark matter with normal baryonic matter included can be matched to galaxy observations , there is not yet any straightforward explanation as to why the observed scaling relationship exists there have been a number of attempts to solve the problem of galaxy rotation by modifying gravity without invoking dark matter using data from the spitzer photometry and accurate rotation curves ( sparc ) database , a group has found the radial acceleration traced by rotation curves could be predicted just from the observed baryon distribution ( that is , including stars and gas but not dark matter ) . a model of galaxy based on a general relativity metric was also proposed , showing that the rotation curves for the milky way , ngc 3031 , ngc 3198 and ngc 7331 are consistent with the mass density distributions of the visible matter , avoiding the need for a massive halo of exotic dark matter
