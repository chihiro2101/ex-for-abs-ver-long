despite the increase in ivr technology during the 1970s , the technology was considered complex and expensive for automating tasks in call centers the first commercial application of ivr was an order entry inventory control system designed and developed by steven schmidt in 1973 as call centers began to migrate to multimedia in the late 1990s , companies started to invest in computer telephony integration ( cti ) with ivr systems with improvements in technology , systems could use speaker-independent voice recognition of a limited vocabulary instead of requiring the person to use dtmf signaling starting in the 2000s , voice response became more common and cheaper to deploy dtmf decoding and speech recognition are used to interpret the caller 's response to voice prompts ivr technology is also being introduced into automobile systems for hands-free operation this information can be used to profile the caller and route the call to an agent with a particular skill set ) interactive voice response can be used to front-end a call center operation by identifying the needs of the caller a traditional ivr depended upon proprietary programming or scripting languages , whereas modern ivr applications are generated in a similar way to web pages , using standards such as voicexml , ccxml , srgs and ssml the ability to use xml-driven applications allows a web server to act as the application server , freeing the ivr developer to focus on the call flow a directed dialogue prompt communicates a set of valid responses to the user ( e.g the key difference is that with directed dialogue , the user is more likely to speak an option exactly as was communicated by the prompt ( e.g with an open-ended prompt , however , the user is likely to include extraneous words or phrases ( e.g open-ended recognition also requires a larger grammar set , which accounts for a wider array of permutations of a given response ( e.g in addition , these tools normally provide extension mechanisms for software integration , such as an http interface to a website and a java interface for connecting to a database ivr systems are used to service high call volumes at lower cost call centers use ivr systems to identify and segment callers additional caller authentication data could include account number , personal information , password and biometrics ( such as voice print ) ivr can be used to provide a more sophisticated voice mail experience to the caller some of the largest installed ivr platforms are used for televoting on television game shows , such as pop idol and big brother , which can generate enormous call spikes the use of video gives ivr systems the ability to implement multimodal interaction with the caller it is also possible to deploy two-prong ivr services where the initial ivr application is used to route the call to the appropriate contact center ivr has historically received criticism for its difficulty of use and a lack of appreciation of the caller 's needs as well as objections to providing a voice response to an automated system
