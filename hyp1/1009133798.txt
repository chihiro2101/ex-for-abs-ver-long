ideally , campfires should be made in a fire ring if a fire ring is not available , a temporary fire site may be constructed bare rock or unvegetated ground is ideal for a fire site alternatively , turf may be cut away to form a bare area and carefully replaced after the fire has cooled to minimize damage a ring of rocks is sometimes constructed around a fire fire rings , however , do not fully protect material on the ground from catching fire never bury hot coals , as they can continue to burn and cause root fires or wildfires making sure the fire pit is large enough for the campfire and there are no combustibles near the campfire , and avoiding the construction of the campfire on a windy day there are , by conventional classification , three types of material involved in building a fire without manufactured fuels or modern conveniences such as lighters it is anything that can be lit with a spark and is usually classified as being thinner than your little finger kindling wood is an arbitrary classification including anything bigger than tinder but smaller than fuel wood a quantity of kindling sufficient to fill a hat may be enough , but more is better a faggot is a related term indicating a bundle of small branches used to feed a small fire or continue developing a bigger fire out of a small one in most realistic cases nowadays , non-natural additions to the fuels mentioned above will be used a functional design is important in the early stages of a fire most of them make no mention of fuelwoodâ€”in most designs , fuelwood is never placed on a fire until the kindling is burning strongly ( synthetic rope should be avoided since it produces pollutants when it burns one downside to a tipi fire is that when it burns , the logs become unstable and can fall over a log cabin fire-build likewise begins with a tinder pile the first two kindling sticks are laid parallel to each other , on opposite sides of the tinder pile the tinder is lit , and the kindling is allowed to catch fire eventually , a pile of kindling burns between two pieces of fuelwood , and soon the logs catch fire from it another variation is called the funeral pyre method because it is used for building funeral pyres its main difference from the standard log cabin is that it starts with thin pieces and moves up to thick pieces a hybrid fire combines the elements of both the tipi and the log cabin creating an easily lit yet stable fire structure the hybrid is made by first erecting a small tipi and then proceeding to construct a log cabin around it a cross-fire is built by positioning two pieces of wood with the tinder in between once the fire is burning well , additional pieces of wood are placed on top in layers that alternate directions a lean-to fire-build starts with the same pile of tinder as the tipi fire-build the smaller pieces of kindling are leaned against the big stick so that the tinder is enclosed between them in an alternative method , a large piece of fuelwood or log can be placed on the ground next to the tinder pile then kindling is placed with one end propped up by the larger piece of fuelwood , and the other resting on the ground so that the kindling is leaning over the tinder pile this method is useful in very high winds , as the piece of fuel wood acts as a windbreak beside the danger of people receiving burns from the fire or embers , campfires may spread into a larger fire once the fire is covered thoroughly with sand , water is then added over the fire in lightly used wilderness areas , the area around the campfire is cleaned up to make it look untouched after the fire is extinguished campfire ashes are sometimes used in ceremonies like the campfire ash ceremony
