the aire and calder is a canalisation of the river calder from wakefield to castleford , where it joins the branch from leeds , which follows the river aire the aire continues to flow eastwards to bank dole junction , then continues in a north-easterly direction to haddlesey , from where it follows a winding course to join the river ouse at airmyn the section below haddlesey is no longer part of the navigation , as a derelict lock blocks access to the lower river instead , the selby canal flows northwards from haddlesey to the ouse at selby below dole bank junction , the knottingley and goole canal flows eastwards to join the ouse at goole the aire and calder still fulfils its original purpose of linking leeds and wakefield with york and the humber ( and thence the trent ) , although the routes by which this is achieved have changed significantly more recent canals now also make the navigation a vital link in the english and welsh connected inland waterway network beyond leeds , the leeds and liverpool canal carries boats over the pennines the calder and hebble navigation , which connects to the navigation at wakefield , allows boats to reach the huddersfield broad and narrow canals , and the rochdale canal in the early 1600s , the river aire was navigable to knottingley , and boats carrying up to 30 & nbsp ; tons traded on the river , which was tidal up to this point william pickering , who was mayor of leeds , had made further attempts to obtain an act of parliament for improvements to the river in 1679 , again without success john hadley surveyed the aire , and samuel shelton surveyed the calder although the bill had a lot of support , it was opposed by the city of york , who feared that the river ouse would be damaged by the scheme it named 18 undertakers , nine from the corporation of leeds , and nine '' gentlemen of wakefield '' , who would oversee the improvements to the river aire ( from the river ouse at airmyn via castleford to leeds ) and the river calder ( from castleford to wakefield ) john hadley was engaged as the engineer immediately , and by 1704 the original work was completed , including 12 locks on the aire between haddesley and leeds and 4 on the calder capital to fund the scheme had been raised separately by the wakefield and leeds committees the early trade consisted mainly of woollen goods from leeds , wakefield , halifax and bradford , with wool and corn from lincolnshire and east anglia travelling in the opposite direction there was a long-running dispute with arthur ingram , who owned knottingley mill , which started in 1731 , and was not finally resolved until 1776 , when the company bought both of ingram 's mills they asked john smeaton to suggest improvements in 1771 , but the subsequent attempt to authorise such improvements was disputed in parliament on the basis that the present navigation was totally inadequate the recently finished calder and hebble navigation proposed to build a canal from wakefield to the dutch river , which would bypass the calder completely , and the leeds and liverpool canal supported a leeds to selby canal , which would bypass the aire with parliament not reaching a decision , they reworked their plan , which was now for a canal from haddlesey to selby , with a new cut from ferrybridge to beal , and improvements above castleford in 1774 the leeds to selby bill was rejected by parliament , but the aire and calder bill was passed , aire and calder navigation act 1774 ( 14 geo a barge lock , and a ship lock , , capable of taking vessels up to 400 tons , connected the extensive docks to the ouse faced with yet another outside scheme which would bypass the navigation from wakefield to ferrybridge , the company looked at improvements which would give of water all the way to both leeds and wakefield the leeds line was completed in april 1835 , somewhat later than anticipated , as the banks were made more substantial , to cope with steam tugs , which would be introduced in due course in 1905 , the new junction canal connected the aire and calder to the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation near stainforth between wakefield and leeds , via castleford , the navigation is part of a circular cruising route or '' ring '' , formed by the leeds & liverpool and the huddersfield or rochdale canals
