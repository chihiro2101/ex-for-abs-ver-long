there is specialized equipment used by team ropers : rope - made of synthetic fibers , used to rope the steer , there are two kinds of ropes , one for the header ( the person who ropes the head ) and one for the heeler ( the person who ropes the legs ) horn wraps - protective wraps that go around the horns of the steer to prevent rope burns and reduce the risk of a horn breaking when roped roping gloves - worn to prevent rope burns on the hands of the riders then , one at a time , a steer is moved into a chute with spring-loaded doors in front and a solid gate behind , so that only one animal is released at a time the header is on one side ( usually the left , for a right-handed header ) whose job is to rope the steer around the horns , then turn the steer so its hind legs can be roped by the '' heeler '' , who starts from the box on the other side of the chute the header must rope the steer with one of three legal catches : a clean horn catch around both horns , a neck catch around the neck or a half-head catch around the neck and one horn once the header has made the dally , the rider turns the horse , usually to the left , and the steer will follow , still running there is a 5-second penalty for roping only one hind leg and a 10-second penalty for breaking the barrier if both occur on the same run then the penalties are added together for a total of 15 seconds added the header has three possible legal catches : both horns one horn and the nose ( half-head ) the neck any other head catch is considered illegal heelers use a different technique , a right-handed heeler will twirl the loop on the left side of the rider 's body , always keeping the tip of the loop on the left side so that when the loop is thrown , it will go under the steer
