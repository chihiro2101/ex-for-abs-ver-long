was used by chinese cultures from neolithic times and became more widespread in the xia , shang , and zhou dynasties incense usage reached its peak during the song dynasty with numerous buildings erected specifically for incense ceremonies it was n't until the muromachi period during the 15th and 16th century that incense appreciation ( kōdō ) spread to the upper and middle classes of japanese society a variety of materials have been used in making incense the formula for charcoal-based incense is superficially similar to black powder , though it lacks the sulfur mucilaginous material , which can be derived from many botanical sources , is mixed with fragrant materials and water the dry binding powder usually comprises about 10 % of the dry weight in the finished incense incense is available in various forms and degrees of processing they can generally be separated into '' direct-burning '' and '' indirect-burning '' types the two differ in their composition due to the former 's requirement for even , stable , and sustained burning indirect-burning incense , also called '' non-combustible incense '' , is an aromatic material or combination of materials , such as resins , that does not contain combustible material and so requires a separate heat source finer forms tend to burn more rapidly , while coarsely ground or whole chunks may be consumed very gradually , having less surface area in the west , the best known incense materials of this type are the resins frankincense and myrrh , likely due to their numerous mentions in the bible whole : the incense material is burned directly in raw form on top of coal embers powdered or granulated : incense broken into smaller pieces burns quickly and provides brief but intense odor direct-burning incense is either extruded , pressed into forms , or coated onto a supporting material cored stick : a supporting core of bamboo is coated with a thick layer of incense material that burns away with the core this is the most commonly produced form of incense in japan and tibet rope : the incense powder is rolled into paper sheets , which are then rolled into ropes , twisted tightly , then doubled over and twisted again , yielding a two-strand rope this type of incense is easily transported and stays fresh for extremely long periods incense of the athonite orthodox christian tradition is made by powdering frankincense or fir resin , mixing it with essential oils oxidizer quantity : too little oxidizer in gum-bound incense may prevent the incense from igniting , while too much will cause the incense to burn too quickly , without producing fragrant smoke binder : water-soluble binders such as '' makko '' ensure that the incense mixture does not crumble when dry , dilute the mixture particulate size : the incense mixture has to be well pulverized with similarly sized particulates these are often sold in the united states by flea-market and sidewalk vendors who have developed their own styles small quantities of water are combined with the fragrance and incense base mixture and kneaded into a hard dough the incense dough is then pressed into shaped forms to create cone and smaller coiled incense , or forced through a hydraulic press for solid stick incense traditionally , the bamboo core of cored stick incense is prepared by hand from phyllostachys heterocycla cv this process has been largely replaced by machines in modern incense production powder-coating : powder-coating is used mainly to produce cored incense of either larger coil ( up to 1 meter in diameter ) or cored stick forms the dry incense powder is then tossed and piled over the sticks while they are spread apart the sticks are then gently rolled and packed to maintain roundness while more incense powder is repeatedly tossed onto the sticks the coated incense is then allowed to dry in open air additional coatings of incense mixture can be applied after each period of successive drying the makkō is lit and the incense mixture is burned on top this method is known as sonae-kō ( religious burning ) for direct-burning incense , the tip or end of the incense is ignited with a flame or other heat source until the incense begins to turn into ash at the burning end in most arab countries , incense is burned in the form of scented chips or blocks called bakhoor this utility led to the use of incense in funerary ceremonies because the incense could smother the scent of decay the regular burning of direct-burning incense has been used for chronological measurement in incense clocks the technique used is called “ smoke cleansing ” and is done by holding a healing stone over the smoke of burning incense for 20 to 30 seconds '' although several studies have not shown a link between incense and lung cancer , many other types of cancer have been directly linked to burning incense
