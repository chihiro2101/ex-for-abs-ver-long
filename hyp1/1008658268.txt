the liquid is also colorless but can appear as a brownish yellow liquid due to the presence of no 2 according to the following equilibrium : : n 2 o 4 ⇌ 2 no 2 higher temperatures push the equilibrium towards nitrogen dioxide inevitably , some dinitrogen tetroxide is a component of smog containing nitrogen dioxide the gas is essentially pure nitrogen dioxide , which is condensed into dinitrogen tetroxide in a brine-cooled liquefier dinitrogen tetroxide can also be made through the reaction of concentrated nitric acid and metallic copper the oxidation of copper by nitric acid is a complex reaction forming various nitrogen oxides of varying stability which depends on the concentration of the nitric acid , presence of oxygen , and other factors the unstable species further react to form nitrogen dioxide which is then purified and condensed to form dinitrogen tetroxide nitrogen tetroxide is used as an oxidizer in one of the most important rocket propellants because it can be stored as a liquid at room temperature when used as a propellant , dinitrogen tetroxide is usually referred to simply as nitrogen tetroxide and the abbreviation nto is extensively used '' cool '' dinitrogen tetroxide is compressed and heated , causing it to dissociate into nitrogen dioxide at half the molecular weight this hot nitrogen dioxide is expanded through a turbine , cooling it and lowering the pressure , and then cooled further in a heat sink , causing it to recombine into nitrogen tetroxide at the original molecular weight when exposed to oxygen , no is converted back into nitrogen dioxide : : 2 no + o 2 → 2 no 2 the resulting no 2 and n 2 o 4 can be returned to the cycle to give the mixture of nitrous and nitric acids again
