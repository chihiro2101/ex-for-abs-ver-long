an alabama law authorized teachers to set aside one minute at the start of each day for a moment for '' meditation or voluntary prayer ishmael jaffree , an american citizen , was a resident of mobile county , alabama and a parent of three students who attended school in the mobile county public school system ; two of the three children were in the second grade and the third was in kindergarten jaffree sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction restraining the defendants from '' maintaining or allowing the maintenance of regular religious prayer services or other forms of religious observances in the mobile county public schools in violation of the first amendment as made applicable to states by the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution the original complaint did n't mentioned any specific statutes , but the case later dealt with three laws for public schools in alabama : the first law ( 1978 ) created a minute of silence for meditation , the second law ( 1981 ) added the option of voluntary prayer , and the third law ( 1982 ) authorized teachers to recite a prayer with “ willing students ” despite initially granting a preliminary injunction , the united states district court for the southern district of alabama ultimately allowed the practice , found in favor of the defendants and uphold all three laws the united states 11th circuit court of appeals also uphold the 1978 law , but reversed with respect to the laws from 1981 and 1982 , holding the laws unconstitutional '' the '' lemon test , '' previously created by the court to help determine whether legislation violates the establishment clause , included as a factor that '' the statute must have a secular legislative purpose , '' and the court further held in jaffree that '' the first amendment requires that a statute must be invalidated if it is entirely motivated by a purpose to advance religion '' the record in the case showed not only that the alabama law '' was not motivated by any clearly secular purpose '' but that '' indeed , the statute had no secular purpose '' with no secular purpose behind the law , and because it expanded a previous law that already allowed for meditation so that it now explicitly included '' voluntary prayer '' as well , the only possible conclusion was that the new law was passed '' for the sole purpose of expressing the state 's endorsement of prayer activities for one minute at the beginning of each schoolday he begins by pointing out that the statute authorizing a moment of silence at the beginning of a school day , which mentions the word “ prayer ” , does not , thereby , unconstitutionally promote a religion in his conclusion , justice burger reiterates the fact that the statute was not an unconstitutional endorsement and promotion of religion that sought to establish a state church , but an entirely constitutional measure designed to prevent truly unconstitutional infringement upon the rights of students to pray individually as they please jaffree , relies heavily upon pointing out the faults behind the common misunderstanding of thomas jefferson 's statements about the “ separation of church and state ” in his letter to the danbury baptist association thus , says rehnquist , one can see indisputably that the spirit in which the congress approved the establishment clause was one of open-minded toleration , not one of hostility towards religion
