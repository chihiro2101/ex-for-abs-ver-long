ibm 701 competed with remington rand 's univac 1103 in the scientific computation market , which had been developed for the nsa , so it was held secret until permission to market it was obtained in 1951 based on the trials , the two machines had comparable computational speed , with a slight advantage for ibm 's machine , but the univac was favored unanimously for its significantly faster input-output equipment 23-34 at the lawrence livermore national laboratory , an ibm 701 meant that scientists could run nuclear explosives computations faster the first 701 was delivered to ibm 's world headquarters in new york was describing the market acceptance of the ibm 701 computer this is what he said at the stockholders ' meeting , '' as a result of our trip , on which we expected to get orders for five machines , we came home with orders for 18 ‚Äù the 704 was not compatible with the 701 , however , as the 704 increased the size of instructions from 18 bits to 36 bits to support the extra features in 1952 ibm paired with language scholars from georgetown university to develop a translation software for use on computers on january 7 , 1954 , the team developed an experimental software program that allowed the ibm 701 computer to translate from russian to english the ibm 701 can claim to be the first computer displaying the potential of artificial intelligence in arthur samuel 's checkers-playing program on february 24 , 1956 self-proclaimed checkers master robert nealey played the game on an ibm 7094 computer in 1962 and the computer won the lawrence livermore national laboratory developed a language compilation and runtime system called the kompiler for their ibm 701 the fortran compiler also developed by backus was not released by ibm until the ibm 704 ibm world headquarters , new york , n.y the ibm 701 had only two programmer accessible registers : the accumulator was 38 bits long ( adding two overflow bits ) amdahl discusses his role in the design of several computers for ibm including the ibm 701 , the ibm 704 and the stretch
