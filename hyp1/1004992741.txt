every color-managed device requires a personalized table , or '' color profile , '' which characterizes the color response of that particular device each color profile describes these colors relative to a standardized set of reference colors ( the '' profile connection space '' ) color-managed software then uses these standardized profiles to translate color from one device to another this is usually performed by a color management module ( cmm ) to describe the behavior of various output devices , they must be compared ( measured ) in relation to a standard color space color management is sometimes sidestepped by calibrating devices to a common standard color space such as srgb ; when such calibration is done well enough , no color translations are needed to get all devices to handle colors consistently the icc standard permits the exchange of output device characteristics and color spaces in the form of metadata color transformation , or color space conversion , is the transformation of the representation of a color from one color space to another this calculation is required whenever data is exchanged inside a color-managed chain and carried out by a color matching module transforming profiled color information to different output devices is achieved by referencing the profile data into a standard color space by ensuring that the reference color space covers the many possible colors that humans can see , this concept allows one to exchange colors between many different color output devices in this process there are approximations involved which make sure that the image keeps its important color qualities and also gives an opportunity to control on how the colors are being changed color management : color space conversion , cambridge in color icc specification icc.1:2010 before the actual rendering intent is carried out , one can temporarily simulate the rendering by soft proofing since 1997 color management in windows is available through an icc color management system ( icm ) gamma correction color chart digital printing icc profile international color consortium it8 linux color management
