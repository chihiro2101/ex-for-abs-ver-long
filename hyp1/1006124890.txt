usually , an enzyme molecule has only two active sites , and the active sites fit with one specific type of substrate an active site contains a binding site that binds the substrate and orients it for catalysis the orientation of the substrate and the close proximity between it and the active site is so important that in some cases the enzyme can still function properly even though all other parts are mutated and lose function initially , the interaction between the active site and the substrate is non-covalent and transient the charge distribution on the substrate and active site must be complementary , which means all positive and negative charges must be cancelled out the active site usually contains non-polar amino acids , although sometimes polar amino acids may also occur for example , alcohol dehydrogenase which catalyses the transfer of a hydride ion from ethanol to nadh interacts with the substrate methyl group , hydroxyl group and the pro- ( r ) hydrogen that will be abstracted during the reaction if these interactions are interfered with , for example by extreme ph values , high temperature or high ion concentrations , this will cause the enzyme to denature and lose its catalytic activity a tighter fit between an active site and the substrate molecule is believed to increase the efficiency of a reaction if the tightness between the active site of dna polymerase and its substrate is increased , the fidelity , which means the correct rate of dna replication will also increase there are three proposed models of how enzymes fit their specific substrate : the lock and key model , the induced fit model , and the conformational selection model he proposed that the active site and substrate are two stable structures that fit perfectly without any further modification , just like a key fits into a lock if one substrate perfectly binds to its active site , the interactions between them will be strongest , resulting in high catalytic efficiency apart from competitive inhibition , this theory can not explain the mechanism of action of non-competitive inhibition either , as they do not bind to the active site but nevertheless influence catalytic activity daniel koshland 's theory of enzyme-substrate binding is that the active site and the binding portion of the substrate are not exactly complementary the induced fit model is a development of the lock-and-key model and assumes that an active site is flexible and changes shape until the substrate is completely bound enzyme surface is flexible and only the correct catalyst can induce interaction leading to catalysis conformational changes may then occur as the substrate is bound this movement of protein surface can create microenvironments that favour the catalysis electrostatic interaction : in an aqueous environment , the oppositely charged groups in amino acid side chains within the active site and substrates attract each other , which is termed electrostatic interaction although the individual force is weak , as the total number of interactions between the active site and substrate is massive the sum of them will be significant when dissolving in water a protein molecule will curl up into a ball-like shape , leaving hydrophilic groups in outside while hydrophobic groups are deeply buried within the centre once the substrate is bound and oriented to the active site , catalysis can begin during enzyme catalytic reaction , the substrate and active site are brought together in a close proximity this means the number of substrate molecules involved in the reaction is also increased since bulk molecules can be excluded from the active site this energy output can be minimised in addition , this binding is favoured by entropy as the energy cost associated with solution reaction is largely eliminated since solvent can not enter active site in the end , the active site may manipulate the molecular orbital of the substrate into a suitable orientation to reduce activation energy many enzymes including serine protease , cysteine protease , protein kinase and phosphatase evolved to form transient covalent bonds between them and their substrates to lower the activation energy and allow the reaction to occur nucleophilic catalysis : this process involves the donation of electrons from the enzyme 's nucleophile to a substrate to form a covalent bond between them during the transition state the easiest way to distinguish between them is to check whether the reaction rate is determined by the concentrations of the general acid and base the formation of transition state within the solution requires a large amount of energy to relocate solvent molecules and the reaction is slowed in the active site , there are two cysteine residues besides the fad cofactor and are used to break the disulphide bond during the catalytic reaction the first sg âˆ’ anion is released and then receives one proton from adjacent sh group and from the first glutathione monomer they can also induce transient conformational changes in the active site so substrates can not fit perfectly with it thumb an regulatory site is a site on an enzyme , unrelated to its active site , which can bind an effector molecule
