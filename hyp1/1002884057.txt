under ideal conditions in its native range , norway maple may live up to 250 years , but often has a much shorter life expectancy ; in north america , for example , sometimes only 60 years the norway maple is a member ( and is the type species ) of the section platanoidea pax , characterised by flattened , disc-shaped seeds and the shoots and leaves containing milky sap other related species in this section include acer campestre ( field maple ) , acer cappadocicum ( cappadocian maple ) , acer lobelii ( lobel 's maple ) , and acer truncatum ( shandong maple ) from the field maple , the norway maple is distinguished by its larger leaves with pointed , not blunt , lobes , and from the other species by the presence of one or more teeth on all of the lobes the sugar maple is easy to differentiate by clear sap in the petiole ( leaf stem ) ; norway maple petioles have white sap the tips of the points on norway maple leaves reduce to a fine '' hair '' , while the tips of the points on sugar maple leaves are , on close inspection , rounded while the shape and angle of leaf lobes vary somewhat within all maple species , the leaf lobes of norway maple tend to have a more triangular shape , in contrast to the more squarish lobes often seen on sugar maples flowering and seed production begins at ten years of age , however large quantities of seeds are not produced until the tree is 20 norway maple seeds are flattened , while those of sugar maple are globose the sugar maple usually has a brighter orange autumn color , where the norway maple is usually yellow , although some of the red-leaved cultivars appear more orange leafout of norway maple is tied to photoperiod and initiated when day lengths reach approximately 13 hours , which is generally in april norway maple sits ambiguously between hard and soft maple with a janka hardness of this species as grown in the former yugoslavia is also called bosnian maple , and is probably the maple used by the famous italian violin makers , stradivari and guarneri norway maples are not typically cultivated for maple syrup production due to the lower sugar content of the sap compared to sugar maple the norway maple was introduced to northeastern north america between 1750 and 1760 as an ornamental shade tree the norway maple also suffers less herbivory than the sugar maple , allowing it to gain a competitive advantage against the latter species
