the genus lynx is now accepted , and the bobcat is listed as lynx rufus in modern taxonomic sources the genus lynx shares a clade with the genetic lineages puma , prionailurus and felis dated to ; lynx diverged approximately the bobcat is believed to have evolved from the eurasian lynx , which crossed into north america by way of the bering land bridge during the pleistocene , with progenitors arriving as early as 2.6 million years ago the first wave moved into the southern portion of north america , which was soon cut off from the north by glaciers this population evolved into modern bobcats around 20,000 years ago a second population arrived from asia and settled in the north , developing into the modern canada lynx 13 bobcat subspecies have been historically recognized based on morphological characteristics : l rufus ( schreber ) – eastern and midwestern united states l gigas ( bangs ) – northern new york to nova scotia and new brunswick l floridanus ( rafinesque ) – southeastern united states and inland to the mississippi valley , up to southwestern missouri and southern illinois l californicus ( mearns ) – california west of the sierra nevada l allen ) – central mexico , with a northern extension along the west coast to southern sonora l fasciatus ( rafinesque ) – oregon , washington west of the cascade range , northwestern california , and southwestern british columbia l peninsularis ( thomas ) – baja california l the bobcat resembles other species of the midsize genus lynx , but is on average the smallest of the four its coat is variable , though generally tan to grayish-brown , with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail bobcats in the desert regions of the southwest have the lightest-colored coats , while those in the northern , forested regions are darkest bobcat eyes are yellow with round , black pupils the nose of the bobcat is pinkish-red , and it has a base color of gray or yellowish- or brownish-red on its face , sides , and back the pupils are round , black circles and will widen during nocturnal activity to maximize light reception however , cases of bobcats swimming long distances across lakes have been recorded bobcat swims across lake lanier ) , animal : the definitive visual guide to the world 's wildlife furthermore , a june 20 , 2012 report of a new hampshire roadkill specimen listed the animal 's weight at 60-pound bobcat turns up as roadkill the bobcat is muscular , and its hind legs are longer than its front legs , giving it a somewhat irregular gait the bobcat is crepuscular , and is active mostly during twilight bobcat activities are confined to well-defined territories , which vary in size depending on the sex and the distribution of prey '' patterns in bobcat ( lynx rufus ) scent marking and communication behaviors its den smells strongly of the bobcat the sizes of bobcats ' home ranges vary significantly ; a world conservation union ( iucn ) summary of research suggests ranges from one study in kansas found resident males to have ranges of roughly , and females less than half that area transient bobcats were found to have both larger ( roughly and less well-defined home ranges reports on seasonal variation in range size have been equivocal one study found a large variation in male range sizes , from in summer up to in winter given their smaller range sizes , two or more females may reside within a male 's home range in line with widely differing estimates of home range size , population density figures are divergent , from one to 38 bobcats per in one survey one study noted a dense , unhunted population in california had a sex ratio of 2.1 males per female the bobcat hunts by stalking its prey and then ambushing with a short chase or pounce its main prey varies by region : in the eastern united states , it is the eastern cottontail and new england cottontail , and in the north , it is the snowshoe hare when these prey species exist together , as in new england , they are the primary food sources of the bobcat birds up to the size of an adult trumpeter swan are also taken in ambushes , along with their fledglings and eggs the bobcat hunts animals of different sizes , and adjusts its hunting techniques accordingly the female may later go on to mate with other males , and males generally mate with several females like all cats , the bobcat 'directly registers ' , meaning its hind prints usually fall exactly on top of its fore prints at least one confirmed observation of a bobcat and an american black bear ( ursus americanus ) fighting over a carcass is confirmed in addition , bobcat sightings have been confirmed in northern indiana , and one was killed near albion , michigan in 2008 this leads to a decrease in natural genetic diversity among bobcat populations stories featuring the bobcat , in many variations , are found in some indigenous cultures of north america , with parallels in south america
