the term klezmer comes from a combination of hebrew words : klei , meaning '' tools , utensils or instruments of '' and zemer , '' melody '' ; leading to k'lei zemer , literally '' instruments of music '' or '' musical instruments '' originally , klezmer referred to musical instruments , and was later extended to refer , as a pejorative , to musicians themselves it was not until the late 20th century that the word came to identify a musical genre early 20th century recordings and writings most often refer to the style as '' yiddish '' music , although it is also sometimes called freilech music ( yiddish , literally '' happy music '' ) the first recordings to use the term '' klezmer '' to refer to the music were the klezmorim 's east side wedding and streets of gold in 1977/78 , followed by andy statman and zev feldman 's jewish klezmer music in 1979 klezmer is easily identifiable by its characteristic expressive melodies , reminiscent of the human voice , complete with laughing and weeping this is not a coincidence ; the style is meant to imitate khazone and paraliturgical singing a number of dreydlekh ( a yiddish word for ornament ( music ) ) , such as krekhts ( '' sobs '' ) are used to produce this style various musical styles influenced traditional klezmer music klezmer musicians heard and adapted traditional romanian music , which is reflected in the dance forms found throughout surviving klezmer music repertoire ( e.g the bible has several descriptions of orchestras and levites making music , but after the destruction of the second temple in 70 ce , many rabbis discouraged musical instruments klezmorim based much of their secular instrumental music upon the devotional vocal music of the synagogue , in particular hazzan music klezmorim often travelled and played with romani musicians ( '' lăutari '' ) , because they occupied similar social strata klezmorim were respected for their musical abilities and diverse repertoire , but they were by no means restricted to playing klezmer hence musicians took up the violin , tsimbl ( or cymbalom ) , and other stringed instruments the first musician to play klezmer in european concerts , josef gusikov , played a type of xylophone which he invented and called a '' wood and straw instrument '' later , around 1855 under the reign of alexander ii of russia , ukraine permitted loud instruments the clarinet started to replace the violin as the instrument of choice also , a shift towards brass and percussion happened when klezmorim were conscripted into military bands initially , the klezmer tradition was not maintained much by u.s george gershwin was familiar with klezmer music , and the opening clarinet glissando of rhapsody in blue suggests this influence , although the composer did not compose klezmer directly at the same time , non-jewish composers were also turning to klezmer for a prolific source of fascinating thematic material in the mid-to-late 1970s there was a klezmer revival in the united states and europe , led by giora feidman , the klezmorim , zev feldman , andy statman , and the klezmer conservatory band in 1985 , henry sapoznik and adrienne cooper founded klezkamp to teach klezmer and other yiddish music the 1980s saw a second wave of revival , as interest grew in more traditionally inspired performances with string instruments , largely with non-jews of the united states and germany musicians began to track down older european klezmer , by listening to recordings , finding transcriptions , and making field recordings of the few klezmorim left in eastern europe in the 1990s , musicians from the san francisco bay area helped further interest in klezmer music by taking it into new territory today the band has developed a new sound of modern klezmer , pushing the perimeter of klezmer to incorporate many cultures and touring worldwide they wanted to explore klezmer and lăutari roots , and fuse the music of the two '' other european '' groups in order to preserve and promote klezmer music in israel , burstein founded the jerusalem klezmer association , which has become a center for learning and performance of klezmer music in the country according to walter zev feldman , the klezmer dance repertoire seems to have been relatively uniform across the areas of jewish settlement in the russian empire few scions of klezmer dynasties remained in europe , one notable exception being leopold kozlowski of poland also , recordings specific to one area may not have represented klezmer repertoire from other parts of the region klezmer music often uses '' folk scales , '' or scales commonly found in folk music , such as the harmonic minor and phrygian dominant having a third distinct section is a relatively unique aspect of klezmer music in america , this trend has continued into the present day , with hand-held or strap-held instruments like guitars , saxophones , and even harmonicas integrated into klezmer ensembles for example , the typical american klezmer wedding band uses a portable electronic synthesizer , not a piano barcelona gipsy klezmer orchestra ( bgko ) mames babegenush kiselgof klezmer fiddle list of klezmer bands list of klezmer musicians secular jewish music shlemiel the first
