thumb the parabolic shape of a dish reflects the signal to the dish ’ s focal point the lnb converts the signals from electromagnetic or radio waves to electrical signals and shifts the signals from the downlinked c-band and/or ku-band to the l band range direct broadcast satellite dishes use an lnbf , which integrates the feedhorn with the lnb a new form of omnidirectional satellite antenna , which does not use a directed parabolic dish and can be used on a mobile platform such as a vehicle was announced by the university of waterloo in 2004 the large size of dish required for lower frequencies led to the dishes being constructed from metal mesh on a metal framework modern dishes intended for home television use are generally 43 & nbsp ; cm ( 18 & nbsp ; in ) to 80 & nbsp ; cm ( 31 & nbsp ; in ) in diameter , and are fixed in one position , for ku-band reception from one orbital position in the lnb they become down converted to 950–2150 & nbsp ; mhz , which is the frequency range allocated for the satellite service on the coaxial cable between lnbf and receiver in a single receiver residential installation there is a single coaxial cable running from the receiver set-top box in the building to the lnb on the dish thumb a satellite finder ( or sat finder ) is a satellite field strength meter used to accurately point satellite dishes at communications satellites in geostationary orbit with diseqc and usals , the satellite dish will automatically aim itself at one of sixteen satellites programmed in previously when pressing one of the channel buttons on the remote motor-driven satellite dishes using usals can detect other satellites in a constellation after one has been found and aimed at right every standard-size dish enables simultaneous reception from multiple different satellite positions without re-positioning the dish , just by adding additional lnb or using special duo lnb , triple , or four feed monoblock lnb automatic tracking satellite dish satellitedish1.jpg general electric satellite dish for directv satellite television satellite dishes made of wire mesh first came out in the early 1980s , and were at first in diameter this was the first widely used direct-broadcast satellite television system and allowed dishes as small as 20 & nbsp ; inches to be used this great decrease of dish size also allowed satellite dishes to be installed on vehicles
