atmospheric or wind-borne fugitive dust , also known as aeolian dust , comes from arid and dry regions where high velocity winds are able to remove mostly silt-sized material , deflating susceptible surfaces saharan dust in particular can be transported and deposited as far as the caribbean and the amazon basin , and may affect air temperatures , cause ocean cooling , and alter rainfall amounts recently , initiatives such as project-dust have been established to directly study dust in the middle east dust kicked up by vehicles traveling on roads may make up 33 % of air pollution road dust consists of deposits of exhaust gas , particles from tire and brake dust , dust from paved roads or potholes , and dust from construction sites control of road dust is a significant challenge in urban areas , and also in other locations with high levels of vehicular traffic upon unsealed roads , such as mines and landfill dumps road dust may be suppressed by mechanical methods like street sweeper vehicles equipped with vacuum cleaners , vegetable oil sprays , or with water sprayers the danger of coal dust resulted in environmental legislation regulating work place air quality in some jurisdictions most governmental epas , including the united states environmental protection agency ( epa ) mandate that facilities that generate fugitive dust , minimize or mitigate the production of dust in their operation dust control is the suppression of solid particles with diameters less than 500 micrometers care is required when removing dust to avoid causing the dust to become airborne a dust resistant surface is a state of prevention against dust contamination or damage , by a design or treatment of materials and items in manufacturing or through a repair process dust also covers solid planetary bodies , and vast dust storms can occur on mars which cover almost the entire planet dust in this regime has a complicated emission spectrum , and includes both thermal dust emission and spinning dust emission image : dust over southeast australia.jpg dry , windy weather sends clouds of dust across south-eastern australia
