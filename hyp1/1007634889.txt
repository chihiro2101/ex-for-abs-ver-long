the purpose of any engine bell is to direct the exhaust of a rocket engine in one direction , generating thrust in the opposite direction if the exhaust is allowed to escape in this form , only a small part of the flow will be moving in the correct direction and thus contribute to forward thrust ambient air pressure also imparts a small pressure against the exhaust , helping to keep it moving in the '' right '' direction as it exits the engine , outward from the main exhaust plume ) , the efficiency of the engine is reduced as the rocket travels because this escaping exhaust is no longer contributing to the thrust of the engine an aerospike rocket engine seeks to eliminate this loss of efficiency instead of firing the exhaust out of a small hole in the middle of a bell , an aerospike engine avoids this random distribution by firing along the outside edge of a wedge-shaped protrusion , the '' spike '' , which serves the same function as a traditional engine bell the idea behind the aerospike design is that at low altitude the ambient pressure compresses the exhaust against the spike exhaust recirculation in the base zone of the spike can raise the pressure in that zone to nearly ambient since the pressure in front of the vehicle is ambient , this means that the exhaust at the base of the spike nearly balances out with the drag experienced by the vehicle the recirculation zone at the base of the spike maintains the pressure in that zone to a fraction of 1 bar , higher than the near-vacuum in front of the vehicle , thus giving extra thrust as altitude increases in july 2014 firefly aerospace announced its planned alpha launcher that uses an aerospike engine for its first stage a new company , firefly aerospace , has replaced the aerospike engine with a conventional engine in the alpha 2.0 design in june 2017 , arca announced that they would fly their demonstrator3 rocket to space , also using a linear aerospike engine in september 2017 , arca announced that , after being delayed , their linear aerospike engine was ready to perform ground tests and flight tests on a demonstrator3 rocket
