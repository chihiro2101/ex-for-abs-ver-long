it would appear that some of the earliest empirical explorations of mindset originated in the early 1900s ( gollwitzer 1990 , 2012 ) the attention to mindset within the study of cognitive psychology has continued relatively unabated in addition to the field of cognitive psychology , the use of mindset is evident within the social sciences and several other fields ( e.g a characteristic of this area of study , in all its various manifestations , is the fragment use of mindset throughout the academy ( e.g a well-known example is the '' cold war mindset '' prevalent in both the u.s most theorists consider that the key responsibility of an embedded power group is to challenge the assumptions that comprise the group 's own mindset according to these commentators , power groups that fail to review or revise their mindsets with sufficient regularity can not hold power indefinitely , as a single mindset is unlikely to possess the flexibility and adaptability needed to address all future events may have made that country more able to challenge assumptions than the kremlin with its more static bureaucracy modern military theory attempts to challenge entrenched mindsets in dealing with asymmetric warfare , terrorism , and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in combination , these threats represent '' a revolution in military affairs '' and require very rapid adaptation to new threats and circumstances naturally , the question regarding the embodiment of a collective mindset comes to mind this variation includes how to define , measure , and conceptualize a mindset as well as the types of mindset identified nevertheless , any discussion of mindset should include recognition concerning the numerous , varied , and growing number of mindsets and mindset theories that receive attention in multiple disciplines throughout the academy mindset theory , as based on the cultural values defined by sagiv and schwarts , explains the nature , functions , and variables that make up the characteristics of personality hierarchical bureaucrats generally view the world as having natural order with competition and consequences much like natural selection fixed and growth mindset according to carol dweck , individuals can be placed on a continuum according to their implicit views of '' where ability comes from '' according to dweck , individuals with a '' growth '' mindset are more likely to continue working hard despite setbacks dweck argues that the growth mindset '' will allow a person to live a less stressful and more successful life '' in a 2012 interview , dweck defined both fixed and growth mindsets : an example of a person with a growth mindset is an employee who , when posed with an extraordinarily challenging assignment , takes the project as a growing opportunity instead of one that will defeat them a large part of dweck 's research on mindsets has been done in the field of education , and how these mindsets affect a student 's performance in the classroom in order for students to effectively adopt a growth mindset , a classroom culture needs to be established that nurtures this type of thinking as such , it is important for educators to carefully craft and design meaningful learning activities for their students to engage in the classroom possible activities include establishing personal goals , writing letters , or having students share with one another something they used to be poor at and now are very good at in a recent study by hussein ( 2018 ) , the effects of reflective journal writing on students ' growth mindset was examined it was found that the use of journaling could positively affect a student 's learning process by improving their conceptual knowledge , promoting growth mindset , and enhancing understanding of their thoughts through writing the way educators evaluate their students ' work and communicate their progress can also contribute to the establishment of a growth mindset culture in the classroom if an educator hears students saying they are not good at something or ca n't do something , it is important for the teacher to interject with the words '' not yet '' to reinforce the idea that ability and motivation are fluid overall , it is clear to see that a classroom that includes challenging learning tasks , praising of the process , and explicit growth mindset teaching and assessment , is a classroom where students will have the tools needed to become lifelong learners carol dweck and jo boaler have done extensive research on the topics of fixed and growth mindset however , studies on this topic show that there is a disparity in the fixed and growth mindsets of females and males boaler uses carol dweck 's research showing that '' gender differences in mathematics performance only existed among fixed mindset students '' ( boaler , 2013 ) according to chris argyris ( 2004 ) , there are two dominant mindsets in organizations : the productive mindset and the defensive mindset developing your global mindset : the handbook for successful global leaders
