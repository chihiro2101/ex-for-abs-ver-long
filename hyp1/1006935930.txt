history of karyotype studies chromosomes were first observed in plant cells by carl wilhelm von nägeli in 1842 their behavior in animal ( salamander ) cells was described by walther flemming , the discoverer of mitosis , in 1882 the name was coined by another german anatomist , heinrich von waldeyer in 1888 in 1922 seems to have been the first person to define the karyotype as the phenotypic appearance of the somatic chromosomes , in contrast to their gene contents 2nd ed , revised and enlarged , 1958 considering the techniques of the time , these results were remarkable the karyotype of humans includes only 46 chromosomes human and mammalian cytogenetics : a historical perspective human chromosome 2 is now known to be a result of an end-to-end fusion of two ancestral ape chromosomes human chromosome 2 is a fusion of two ancestral six different characteristics of karyotypes are usually observed and compared : differences in absolute sizes of chromosomes these differences probably reflect different amounts of dna duplication these differences probably arose from segmental interchange of unequal lengths humans have one pair fewer chromosomes than the great apes human chromosome 2 appears to have resulted from the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes , and many of the genes of those two original chromosomes have been translocated to other chromosomes heterochromatin stains darker than euchromatin euchromatin is usually under active transcription and stains much lighter as it has less affinity for the giemsa stain thompson & thompson genetics in medicine 7th ed euchromatin regions contain larger amounts of guanine-cytosine pairs a full account of a karyotype may therefore include the number , type , shape and banding of the chromosomes , as well as other cytogenetic information the typical human karyotypes contain 22 pairs of autosome chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes ( allosomes ) the most common karyotypes for females contain two x chromosomes and are denoted 46 , xx ; males usually have both an x and a y chromosome denoted 46 , xy some variations in karyotype , whether to autosomes or allosomes , cause chromosome abnormalities instead of the usual gene repression , some organisms go in for large-scale elimination of heterochromatin , or other kinds of visible adjustment to the karyotype in this process , found in some copepods and roundworms such as ascaris suum , portions of the chromosomes are cast away in particular cells in placental mammals , the inactivation is random as between the two xs ; thus the mammalian female is a mosaic in respect of her x chromosomes the diploid number of the chinese muntjac , muntiacus reevesi , was found to be 46 , all telocentric the low record is held by the nematode parascaris univalens , where the haploid n 1 ; and an ant : myrmecia pilosula the high record would be somewhere amongst the ferns , with the adder 's tongue fern ophioglossum ahead with an average of 1262 chromosomes the fundamental number , fn , of a karyotype is the number of visible major chromosomal arms per set of chromosomes thus , fn ≤ 2 x 2n , the difference depending on the number of chromosomes considered single-armed ( acrocentric or telocentric ) present humans have fn 82 , due to the presence of five acrocentric chromosome pairs : 13 , 14 , 15 , 21 , and 22 ( the human y chromosome is also acrocentric ) ploidy is the number of complete sets of chromosomes in a cell the proportion of flowering plants which are polyploid was estimated by stebbins to be 30–35 % , but in grasses the average is much higher , about 70 % endopolyploidy occurs when in adult differentiated tissues the cells have ceased to divide by mitosis , but the nuclei contain more than the original somatic number of chromosomes in many instances , endopolyploid nuclei contain tens of thousands of chromosomes ( which can not be exactly counted ) evidence of various kinds shows that trends of evolution have gone in different directions in different groups these roughly 800 hawaiian drosophilid species are usually assigned to two genera , drosophila and drosophila , in the family drosophilidae previous islands now beneath the sea ( guyots ) form the emperor seamount chain each chromosome has a characteristic banding pattern that helps to identify them ; both chromosomes in a pair will have the same banding pattern some disorders arise from loss of just a piece of one chromosome , including cri du chat ( cry of the cat ) , from a truncated short arm on chromosome 5 prader-willi syndrome & ndash ; 50 % of cases have a segment of the long arm of chromosome 15 missing ; a deletion of the paternal genes , example of imprinting disorder
