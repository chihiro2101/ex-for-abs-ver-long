in 1717 , a flintlock musket for the french infantry was standardized this became the first standard flintlock musket to be issued to all french troops some references only refer to model 1763 and later versions as charleville flintlock muskets , while other references refer to all models as the charleville charleville muskets had a smoothbore barrel charleville muskets were not used in battle like a modern rifle instead , charleville muskets were fired in mass formations en masse the charleville 's barrel was held into place by three barrel bands this made the charleville sturdier than the british brown bess musket , which used pins to hold the barrel in place charleville muskets were muzzle-loaded and used a flintlock firing mechanism this model standardized most of the design features that would be common to all subsequent models , such as a 69 caliber barrel , an approximate length of 60 & nbsp ; inches ( 1,524 mm ) and an approximate weight of nine to ten pounds ( 4.1 to 4.5 kg ) the model 1717 also standardized the smoothbore barrel and flintlock firing mechanism unlike later models , the model 1717 had a pinned barrel , similar in design of the british brown bess a total of 48,000 model 1717 muskets were produced other minor changes were also made throughout the model 1728 's production life these modified versions are generally considered to be minor variations to the model 1728 , and are not typically considered to be a separate and distinct model of musket a total of 88,000 model 1763 muskets were produced the model 1763 's sturdier design proved to be a bit too heavy , so in 1766 the musket 's design was lightened the model 1770 had a modified lock plate , stronger barrel bands , and a modified retaining spring the model 1770 and 1771 are often grouped together as a single model 2 , as well as the koloniaal model 1836 and 1837 were based heavily on the design of the musket model 1777 the model 1766 and 1777 were also used by the french during their participation in the american revolutionary war
