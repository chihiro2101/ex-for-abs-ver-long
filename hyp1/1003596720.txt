because of their long wavelengths , vlf radio waves can diffract around large obstacles and so are not blocked by mountain ranges , and can propagate as ground waves following the curvature of the earth and so are not limited by the horizon the earth is surrounded by a conductive layer of electrons and ions in the upper atmosphere at the bottom of the ionosphere called the d layer at 60–90 & nbsp ; km ( 37–56 & nbsp ; miles ) altitude , which reflects vlf radio waves vlf waves have very low path attenuation , 2–3 & nbsp ; db per 1,000 & nbsp ; km , with little of the '' fading '' experienced at higher frequencies vlf waves can penetrate seawater to a depth of at least 10–40 & nbsp ; meters ( 30–130 & nbsp ; feet ) , depending on the frequency employed and the salinity of the water , so they are used to communicate with submarines vlf waves at certain frequencies have been found to cause electron precipitation vertical antennas must be used because vlf waves propagate in vertical polarization , but a quarter-wave vertical antenna at 30 & nbsp ; khz ( 10 & nbsp ; km wavelength ) would be high due to their low radiation resistance ( often less than one ohm ) they are inefficient , radiating only 10 % to 50 % of the transmitter power at most , with the rest of the power dissipated in the antenna/ground system resistances high power transmitting antennas for vlf frequencies are very large wire antennas , up to several kilometers long high power stations use variations on the umbrella antenna such as the '' delta '' and '' trideco '' antennas , or multiwire flattop ( triatic ) antennas due to the low radiation resistance , to minimize power dissipated in the ground these antennas require extremely low resistance ground ( earthing ) systems , consisting of radial networks of buried copper wires under the antenna counterpoise systems have also been used , consisting of radial networks of copper cables supported several feet above the ground under the antenna at vlf the design of this coil is challenging ; it must have low resistance at the operating rf frequency , high , and must withstand the high voltage on the antenna end the high capacitance and inductance and low resistance of the antenna-loading coil combination makes it act electrically like a high tuned circuit vlf antennas have very narrow bandwidth and to change the transmitting frequency requires a variable inductor ( variometer ) to tune the antenna the large vlf antennas used for high power transmitters usually have bandwidths of only 50-100 & nbsp ; hertz , and when transmitting frequency shift keying ( fsk ) , the usual mode , the resonant frequency of the antenna must sometimes be dynamically shifted with the modulation , between the two fsk frequencies the high results in very high voltages ( up to 200 & nbsp ; kv ) on the antenna and very good insulation is required large vlf antennas usually operate in 'voltage limited ' mode : the maximum power of the transmitter is limited by the voltage the antenna can accept without air breakdown , corona , and arcing from the antenna a recent alternative used in some military vlf transmitters is a circuit which dynamically shifts the antenna 's resonant frequency between the two output frequencies with the modulation so small inefficient receiving antennas can be used , and the low voltage signal from the antenna can simply be amplified by the receiver without introducing significant noise more significantly , it would be difficult to transmit any distance because it would require an antenna with 100 times the bandwidth of current vlf antennas , which due to the chu-harrington limit would be enormous in size in military networks frequency shift keying ( fsk ) modulation is used to transmit radioteletype data using 5 & nbsp ; bit ita2 or 8 & nbsp ; bit ascii character codes in high power vlf transmitters , to increase the allowable data rate , a special form of fsk called minimum shift keying ( msk ) is used if the two frequencies representing ' 1 ' and ' 0 ' are 50 & nbsp ; hz apart , the standard frequency shift used in military vlf stations , their phases coincide every 20 & nbsp ; ms in the 1920s the discovery of the skywave ( skip ) radio propagation method allowed lower power transmitters operating at high frequency to communicate at similar distances by reflecting their radio waves off a layer of ionized atoms in the ionosphere , and long distance radio communication stations switched to the shortwave frequencies in the usa , the time signal station wwvl began transmitting a 500 & nbsp ; w signal on 20 & nbsp ; khz in august & nbsp ; 1963 vlf transmitter cutler at cutler , maine which transmits on 24 & nbsp ; khz with 1.8 & nbsp ; mw operations tend to congregate around the frequencies 8.27 & nbsp ; khz , 6.47 & nbsp ; khz , 5.17 & nbsp ; khz , and 2.97 & nbsp ; khz
