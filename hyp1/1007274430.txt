now arguing from a position of strength , the manchester & lincoln union rescinded their plans for most of their lines , and obtained an act of parliament on 7 august 1846 allowing them to construct a line from the midland railway at staveley to the canal at worksop the new company amalgamated with the chesterfield canal , to become the rather unwieldy manchester & lincoln union railway & chesterfield & gainsborough canal , with powers to further amalgamate with the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway however , by the time they announced this , the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway had already become part of the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway , and so they amalgamated with that company instead the act of parliament stated that although the canal company was to be dissolved , the entire canal was to be retained , its water supplies maintained , and tolls were to be fixed at a just level the railway company started to operate as a carrier on the canal , and to maintain water levels , the reservoirs at chesterfield were enlarged in 1856 however , the owners considered options for converting the canal from kiverton park to chesterfield into a railway in 1872 , 1873 and 1884 , but on each occasion , the plans were shelved the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway was expanding , and an act of parliament was obtained in 1889 , which allowed them to divert parts of the canal to enable a new railway connecting chesterfield , staveley and beighton to be constructed the beighton to staveley section of the new railway opened on 1 december 1891 , and reached chesterfield on 4 june 1892 close to bluebank lock , the railway , known as the great central railway chesterfield loop , turned to the east and passed to the south of staveley iron works to reach staveley town station prior to construction of this section , the canal looped to the north around the iron works , passing through cinderhill lock before turning south-eastwards the canal was re-routed along the southern edge of the works , and the railway crossed over at staveley works station , almost on top of a new lock which was known as staveley works lock or hollingwood lock the largest drain on resources was the norwood tunnel , where £21,000 had been spent since 1871 , in an attempt to repair damage and raise the roof responsibility for the canal passed the london and north eastern railway ( lner ) in 1923 , who carried out regular maintenance , and repaired and enlarged the lock connecting west stockwith basin to the river trent between 1923 and 1925 parts of the isolated section from the tunnel to chesterfield were infilled and redeveloped left following the post-war labour government nationalisation of the railways and the canals , the chesterfield canal became the responsibility of the british transport commission by 1968 , restoration efforts were sufficiently organised that the chesterfield canal was mentioned in the may edition of the bulletin , produced for members of the inland waterways association ( iwa ) by the forerunners of the waterway recovery group the chesterfield canal trust was formed in september 1976 , determined to restore the canal beyond worksop , and in 1977 they organised a boat rally at worksop to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the canal , in conjunction with the worksop and retford boat club the duke of devonshire opened the festivities , and the chesterfield canal society was formally launched , with a view to attracting support from anyone interested in the canal , rather than just from boaters progress beyond worksop moved forwards rapidly in 1995 , when a derelict land grant was obtained by nottinghamshire county council , and with additional funding from british coal , a £4.5 million scheme began to restore the canal between worksop and the aqueduct over the river ryton which forms the county boundary the complete project cost £19 million , which included an extra £971,000 received from the heritage lottery fund , to allow detailed archaeological investigation of the thorpe and turnerwood lock flights to be undertaken thumb restoration had focussed initially on the route east from norwood tunnel to worksop , which presented relatively few physical obstacles to being restored to navigation derbyshire county council acquired the section of canal between chesterfield and staveley and secured derelict land grants to enable dredging and towpath maintenance to take place in a separate development , a private owner of a length of the canal near boiley farm , killamarsh , obtained a derelict land grant to enable him to restore around of the channel in 1992 in 1997 , the chesterfield canal trust was formed , as a limited company with charitable aims , and took over the assets of the canal society in 1998 over the winter of 2010–11 , the canal trust obtained its first permanent base , when the lock house at hollingwood lock was renovated and a large extension added to the rear funding for the basin was provided by derbyshire county council with a grant from the east midlands development agency , and the work which included the reclamation of the surrounding land , won an award from the institute of civil engineers , given jointly to derbyshire and the contractors nt killingley this area has suffered from subsidence , so when the canal was formally abandoned , the twin-track iron bow girder bridge was removed and the canal was filled in the chesterfield canal partnership , an association of local and regional authorities , including the chesterfield canal trust and other interested parties , have produced detailed plans for all of the work required to reinstate the missing section this would provide a way to reach the chesterfield canal without negotiating the tidal river trent , and would create a new cruising ring , taking in the rother link , river don navigation , stainforth and keadby canal , river trent , and
