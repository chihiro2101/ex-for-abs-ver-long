alternatively , and for greater numbers , one may say for 1/2 '' one over two '' , for 5/8 '' five over eight '' , and so on this '' over '' form is also widely used in mathematics 9 1/2 9½ numbers with a decimal point may be read as a cardinal number , then '' and '' , then another cardinal number followed by an indication of the significance of the second cardinal number ( mainly u.s ) ; or as a cardinal number , followed by '' point '' , and then by the digits of the fractional part 5 ) as though they were longhand fractions ( five tenths ) , such as thirteen and seven tenths for 13.7 this formality is often dropped in common speech and is steadily disappearing in instruction in mathematics and science as well as in international american schools for example : 0.002 is '' point zero zero two '' , '' point oh oh two '' , '' nought point zero zero two '' , etc , occasionally ) 3.1416 is '' three point one four one six '' 99.3 is '' ninety-nine point three '' ; or '' ninety-nine and three tenths '' ( u.s in english the decimal point was originally printed in the center of the line ( 0·002 ) , but with the advent of the typewriter it was placed at the bottom of the line , so that a single key could be used as a full stop/period and as a decimal point '' another common usage is to write out any number that can be expressed as one or two words , and use figures otherwise in this case , the construction is parallel to the one for '' millions '' or '' billions '' , with the number used as a plural count noun , followed by a prepositional phrase with '' of '' , as in '' there are zillions of grains of sand on the beaches of the world some empty numbers may be modified by actual numbers , such as '' four zillion '' , and are used for jest , exaggeration , or to relate abstractly to actual numbers
