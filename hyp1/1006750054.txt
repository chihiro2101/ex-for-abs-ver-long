karl drais included a pivoting brake shoe that could be pressed against the rear iron tyre of his 1817 laufmaschine this was continued on the earliest bicycles with pedals , such as the boneshaker , which were fitted with a spoon brake to press onto the rear wheel the rider could also slow down by resisting the pedals of the fixed wheel drive the next development of the bicycle , the penny-farthings , were similarly braked with a spoon brake or by back pedalling during its development from 1870 to 1878 , there were various designs for brakes , most of them operating on the rear wheel however , as the rear wheel became smaller and smaller , with more of the rider 's weight over the front wheel , braking on the rear wheel became less effective the front brake , introduced by john kean in 1873 , had been generally adopted by 1880 because of its greater stopping power some penny-farthing riders used only back pedalling and got off and walked down steep hills , but most also used a brake having a brake meant that riders could coast down hill by taking their feet off the pedals and placing the legs over the handlebars , although most riders preferred to dismount and walk down steep hills putting the legs under the handlebars with the feet off the pedals placed on foot-rests on the forks had resulted in serious accidents caused by the feet getting caught in the spokes an alternative to the spoon brake for penny-farthings was the caliper brake patented by browett and harrison in 1887 this early version of caliper braking used a rubber block to contact the outside of the penny-farthing 's small rear tyre the relative fragility of the wooden rims used on most bicycles still precluded the use of rim brakes with the introduction of mass-produced bicycle tire by the dunlop rubber , the use of spoon brakes began to decline , as they tended to quickly wear through the thin casing of the new tyres 594,234 , november 23 , 1897 the duck brake used a rod operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin rubber rollers against the front tyre , braking the front wheel 594,234 in 1898 , after the advent of freewheel coasting mechanisms , the first internal coaster brakes were introduced for the rear wheel in the united states , the coaster brake was the most commonly fitted brake throughout the first half of the 20th century , often comprising the only braking system on the bicycle the spoon brake , or plunger brake was probably the first type of bicycle brake and precedes the pneumatic tyre the spoon brake consists of a pad ( often leather ) or metal shoe ( possibly rubber faced ) , which is pressed onto the top of the front tyre perhaps more so than any other form of bicycle brake , the spoon brake is sensitive to road conditions and increases tyre wear dramatically though made obsolete by the introduction of the duck brake , coaster brake , and rod brake , spoon brakes continued to be used in the west supplementally on adult bicycles until the 1930s , and on children 's bicycles until the 1950s jpg spoon brake on front wheel file : marian038.jpg improvised spoon brake on a chinese cargo tricycle mounted on axles secured by friction washers and set at an angle to conform to the shape of the tyre , the rollers were forced against their friction washers upon contacting the tyre , thus braking the front wheel braking power was enhanced by an extra-long brake lever mounted in parallel with and behind the handlebar , which provided additional leverage when braking ( two hands could be used to pull the lever if necessary ) used in combination with a rear coaster brake , a cyclist of the day could stop much more quickly and with better modulation of braking effort than was possible using only a spoon brake or rear coaster brake 198-233 : the spoon brake was fairly ineffective , while the coaster brake did not operate on the front tyre , the most effective position on a two-wheel vehicle during a hard stop 4951 known colloquially as the duck brake , the design was used by many notable riders of the day , and was widely exported to england , australia , and other countries wyman , who crossed the united states aboard a motorized bicycle with a duck roller brake praised its efficiency , stating that '' i controlled my motorbike with it on the steepest grades of the rocky mountains '' rim brakes are so called because braking force is applied by friction pads to the rim of the rotating wheel , thus slowing it and the bicycle brake pads can be made of leather , rubber or cork and are often mounted in metal '' shoes '' however , they perform relatively poorly when the rims are wet , and will brake unevenly if the rims are even slightly warped in normal use this is not a problem , as the brakes are applied with limited force and for a short time , so the heat quickly dissipates to the surrounding air it may also slightly reduce heat transfer to the inside of the rims because it is a thermal insulator many consist of a replaceable rubber pad held on a mounting , or brake shoe , with a post or bolt on the back to attach to the brake many pad designs have a rectangular shape ; others are longer and curved to match the radius of the rim this wedges the shoes higher upon the tapered rim , thus increasing the normal force between shoes and rim surface thus the front brake is typically more effective than the rear when the brakes are so mounted types of rim brakes the following are among the many sub-types of rim brakes : rim brakes have been the subject of countless '' engineering innovations '' a common setup was to combine a front rod brake with a rear coaster brake the caliper brake is a class of cable-actuated brake in which the brake mounts to a single point above the wheel , theoretically allowing the arms to auto-centre on the rim while some designs incorporate dual pivot points & mdash ; the arms pivot on a sub-frame & mdash ; the entire assembly still mounts to a single point caliper brakes tend to become less effective as tyres get wider , and so deeper , reducing the brakes ' mechanical advantage thus caliper brakes are rarely found on modern mountain bikes when the brake lever is squeezed , the arms move together and the brake pads squeeze the rim these brakes are now used on inexpensive bikes ; before the introduction of dual-pivot caliper brakes they were used on all types of road bikes the cable housing attaches like that of a side-pull brake these brakes offer a higher mechanical advantage , and result in better braking this type of brake has symmetrical arms and therefore centre more effectively tension on the cable is evenly distributed to the two arms , preventing the brake from taking a '' set '' to one side or the other they are more effective than side-pull brakes in long reach applications as the distance between the pivot and brake pad or cable attachment is much shorter , reducing flex '' u-brakes '' ( also known by the trademarked term '' 990-style '' ) are essentially the same design as the centre-pull caliper brake thus u-brakes are often interchangeable with , and have the same maintenance issues as , roller cam brakes the cantilever brake is a class of brake in which each arm is attached to a separate pivot point on one side of the seat stay or fork in the second-class lever design , the arm pivots below the rim thus cantilever brake shoes are notoriously difficult to adjust it is a centre-pull cantilever design with an outwardly angled arm protruding on each side , a cable stop on the frame or fork to terminate the cable housing , and a straddle cable between the arms similar to centre-pull caliper brakes originally , cantilever brakes had nearly horizontal arms and were designed for maximum clearance on touring or cyclo-cross bicycles traditional cantilever brakes are difficult to adapt to bicycle suspensions and protrude somewhat from the frame '' linear-pull brakes '' or '' direct-pull brakes '' , commonly referred to by shimano 's trademark '' v-brakes '' , are a side-pull version of cantilever brakes and mount on the same frame bosses they are mounted either on the same pivot points used for cantilever and linear-pull brakes or they can be mounted on four-bolt brake mounts found on many trials frames disc brakes require a hub built to accept the disc , and a fork ( for front brakes ) or frame ( for rear brakes ) built to accept the caliper cable-actuated disc brakes were traditionally the only type of disc brake that could be used with the brake levers found on drop handlebars , sheldon brown , quoted at but this is no longer the case it is also common to use a larger diameter rotor on the front wheel and a smaller rotor on the rear wheel since the front wheel does the most braking ( up to 90 % of the total )
