the mistle thrush was first described by carl linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of systema naturae under its current scientific name turdus is the latin for '' thrush '' , and viscivorus , '' mistletoe eater '' , comes from viscum '' mistletoe '' and vorare , '' to devour '' the bird 's liking for mistletoe berries is also indicated by its english name , '' mistle '' being an old name for the plant a mitochondrial dna study identified the mistle thrush 's closest relatives as the similarly plumaged song and chinese thrushes ; these three species are early offshoots from the eurasian lineage of turdus thrushes after they spread north from africa they are less closely related to other european thrush species such as the blackbird ( t merula ) which are descended from ancestors that had colonised the caribbean islands from africa and subsequently reached europe from there at least eight subspecies have been proposed , but the differences between them are mainly clinal , with birds being paler and less densely spotted in the east of the range mistle thrush fossils have been found in pleistocene deposits from poland and sicily the mistle thrush is the largest thrush native to europe it has a stocky upright posture when on the ground juveniles are similar to adults , but they have paler upperparts with creamy centres to many of the feathers and smaller spots on the yellowish underparts it is paler grey above and whiter below , with fewer black spots deichleri resembles bonapartei in appearance , but is closer in size to the nominate viscivorus , although it has a more slender bill adults have a full moult after breeding , beginning between late may and the end of june , and completed by early october the mistle thrush is much larger , paler and longer-tailed than the sympatric song thrush these are similar to the mistle thrush , but the plain–backed thrush lacks obvious wing bars , is more rufous above than its relative , and is barred rather than spotted below the tone resembles that of the song thrush or blackbird , but compared to its relatives the mistle thrush 's repertoire is less varied and the delivery is slower the song is given from a treetop or other elevated position mainly from november to early june the male is most vocal in the early morning , and its tendency to sing after , and sometimes during , wet and windy weather led to the old name '' stormcock '' the song may be heard in any month , although it is uncommon from july to august while the thrush is moulting the main call , given by both sexes , is a dry chattering krrrr , louder when it is alarmed or excited in these warmer southern areas , it tends to be found in the milder uplands and coastal regions viscivorus breeds in europe and in asia east to the ob , beyond which it is replaced by t deichleri is resident in north africa , corsica and sardinia scandinavian and russian birds start moving south from mid-september onwards , most birds wintering in europe , western turkey and the middle east in the himalayas , the breeding population moves to nearby lower-altitude sites in winter migration may be by day or night , and typically involves individuals or small groups vagrant birds have occurred in the azores , china , crete , faroe islands , iceland , japan , oman , saudi arabia , sikkim and the united arab emirates in the winter 2017/2018 the first record of a mistle thrush for north america was at miramichi in new brunswick the mistle thrush is found in a wide range of habitats containing trees , including forests , plantations , hedges and town parks mistle thrushes breed in the year subsequent to their hatching ; they are monogamous and stay as a pair throughout the year in areas where they are not migratory the male will attack intruders into its breeding area , including birds of prey and corvids , and sometimes cats or humans the mistle thrush has an extensive distribution in europe and western asia , and its european breeding population is estimated at 9–22.2 & nbsp ; million birds when asian breeders are added , this gives a global total of 12.2–44.4 & nbsp ; million although the population now appears to be declining , the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria the song of the mistle thrush is also described in thomas hardy 's '' darkling thrush '' and edward thomas 's '' the thrush ''
