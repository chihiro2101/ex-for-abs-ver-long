what is a pattern ? when a designer designs something – whether a house , computer program , or lamp – they must make many decisions about how to solve problems a single problem is documented with its typical place ( the syntax ) , and use ( the grammar ) with the most common and recognized good solution seen in the wild , like the examples seen in dictionary each such entry is a single design pattern each pattern has a name , a descriptive entry , and some cross-references , much like a dictionary entry a documented pattern should explain why that solution is good in the pattern 's contexts patterns might be invented or found and studied , such as the naturally occurring patterns of design that characterize human environments like all languages , a pattern language has vocabulary , syntax , and grammar – but a pattern language applies to some complex activity other than communication in pattern languages for design , the parts break down in this way : the language description – the vocabulary – is a collection of named , described solutions to problems in a field of interest so , for example , the language for architecture describes items like : settlements , buildings , rooms , windows , latches , etc each solution includes syntax , a description that shows where the solution fits in a larger , more comprehensive or more abstract design occasionally , the smaller problems have no solution , and a different larger solution must be selected eventually all of the remaining design problems are small enough or routine enough to be solved by improvisation by the builders , and the '' design '' is done in the language , therefore , each pattern has to indicate its relationships to other patterns and to the language as a whole the most difficult part of having an outside expert apply a pattern language is in fact to get a reliable , complete list of the problems to be solved of course , the people most familiar with the problems are the people that need a design the idea expressed in a pattern should be general enough to be applied in very different systems within its context , but still specific enough to give constructive guidance the range of situations in which the problems and solutions addressed in a pattern apply is called its context for instance , alexander 's pattern '' a place to wait '' addresses bus stops in the same way as waiting rooms in a surgery , while still proposing helpful and constructive solutions still , the problems and solutions described in a pattern can vary in their level of abstraction and generality on the one side , and specificity on the other side however , even a very abstract pattern will usually contain examples that are , by nature , absolutely concrete and specific alexander gives each pattern a rating by zero , one or two stars , indicating how well they are proven in real-world examples it is generally claimed that all patterns need at least some existing real-world examples the same thinking can be applied to technical devices such as telephones and cars , to social structures like a team working on a project , or to the user interface of a computer program the qualities of a software system , for instance , could be rated by observing whether users spend their time enjoying or struggling with the system in design patterns , make only little use of pattern linking – possibly because it did not make that much sense for their collection of patterns christopher alexander , an architect and author , coined the term pattern language each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment , and then describes the core solution to that problem , in such a way that you can use the solution a million times over , without ever doing it the same way twice christopher alexander 's idea has been adopted in other disciplines , often much more heavily than the original pattern ( architecture ) as depicted in the book a pattern language the deck '' group works : a pattern language for bringing life to meetings and other gatherings '' was published in 2011 leitner , helmut ( 2015 ) : pattern theory : introduction and perspectives on the tracks of christopher alexander
