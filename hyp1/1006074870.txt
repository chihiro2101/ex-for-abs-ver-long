friedman was born wolf friedman , , in chişinău , bessarabia , the son of frederick friedman , a jew from bucharest who worked as a translator and linguist for the russian postal service , and the daughter of a well-to-do wine merchant friedman : principal cryptologist '' three years later , his first name was changed to william meanwhile , george fabyan , who ran a private research laboratory to study any personally interesting project , decided to set up his own genetics project and was referred to friedman friedman had become something of an expert photographer while working on his other projects , and was asked to travel to england on several occasions to help gallup photograph historical manuscripts during her research during this time , friedman wrote a series of 8 papers on cryptography , collectively known as the '' riverbank publications '' , including the first description of the index of coincidence , an important mathematical tool in cryptanalysis with the entry of the united states into world war i , fabyan offered the services of his department of codes and ciphers to the government no federal department existed for this kind of work ( although both the army and navy had had embryonic departments at various times ) , and soon riverbank became the unofficial cryptographic center for the us government analyzing the format of the messages , riverbank realized that the code was based on a dictionary of some sort , a cryptographic technique common at the time the united states government decided to set up its own cryptological service , and sent army officers to riverbank to train under friedman in 1929 , after the american black chamber in new york city was disbanded , its files were entrusted to sis , and the cryptographic and intelligence services was reorganized to suit its new position at the war department friedman coined several terms , including '' cryptanalysis '' , and wrote many monographs on cryptography one of these ( written mostly in his spare time ) was the first draft of his elements of cryptanalysis , which later was expanded to four volumes and became the u.s realizing that mathematical and language skills were essential to sis ' work , friedman managed to get authority to hire three men with both mathematical training and language knowledge left during the 1920s , several new cipher machines were developed generally based on using typewriter mechanics and basic electrical circuitry friedman realized that the new rotor machines would be important , and devoted some time to analyzing hebern 's design however friedman visited bletchley park in april 1943 and played a key role in drawing up the 1943 brusa agreement friedman produced a classic series of textbooks , '' military cryptanalysis '' , which was used to train nsa students friedman has the distinction of having one of the longest known suppressed patent applications , for , a patent for a '' cryptographic system '' barbara friedman ( later atchison ) ( born 1923 ) , and john ramsay friedman ( 1926–2010 )
