pietistic lutherans meet together in conventicles , '' apart from divine service in order to mutually encourage piety '' they believe '' that any true christian could point back in his or her life to an inner struggle with sin that culminated in a crisis and ultimately a decision to start a new , christ-centered life '' pietistic lutherans emphasize following '' biblical divine commands of believers to live a holy life and to strive for holy living , or sanctification '' pietism did not die out in the 18th century , but was alive and active in the american deutscher evangelischer kirchenverein des westens ( german evangelical church society of the west , based in gravois , later german evangelical synod of north america and still later the evangelical and reformed church , a precursor of the united church of christ a discussion of some of the earlier pietist influence in the evangelical and reformed church can be found in dunn et al some vestiges of pietism were still present in 1957 at the time of the formation of the united church of christ in the 21st century pietism is still alive in groups inside the evangelical church in germany however , in the 19th century , there was a revival of confessional lutheran doctrine , known as the neo-lutheranism this movement focused on a reassertion of the identity of lutherans as a distinct group within the broader community of christians , with a renewed focus on the book of concord as a key source of lutheran doctrine scherer was professor of world mission and church history at the lutheran school of theology at chicago until his retirement heppe and ritschl – have included under it nearly all religious tendencies amongst protestants of the last three centuries in the direction of a more serious cultivation of personal piety than that prevalent in the various established churches some historians also speak of a later or modern pietism , characterizing thereby a party in the german church probably influenced by remains of spener 's pietism in westphalia , on the rhine , in württemberg , halle upon saale , and berlin the party , termed the repristination movement , was chiefly distinguished by its opposition to an independent scientific study of theology , its principal theological leader being hengstenberg and its chief literary organ , the evangelische kirchenzeitung pietism also had a strong influence on contemporary artistic culture in germany ; though unread today , the pietist johann georg hamann held a strong influence in his day pietistic lutheranism entered sweden in the 1600s after the writings of johann arndt , philipp jakob spener , and august hermann francke became popular pietistic lutheranism gained patronage under archbishop erik benzelius , who encouraged the pietistic lutheran practices laestadian lutheranism , a form of pietistic lutheranism , continues to flourish in scandinavia , where church of sweden priest lars levi laestadius spearheaded the revival in the 19th century as the forerunners of the pietists in the strict sense , certain voices had been heard bewailing the shortcomings of the church and advocating a revival of practical and devout christianity in 1675 , spener published his pia desideria or earnest desire for a reform of the true evangelical church , the title giving rise to the term '' pietists '' while large numbers of orthodox lutheran theologians and pastors were deeply offended by spener 's book , many other pastors immediately adopted spener 's proposals in leipzig , a society of young theologians was formed under his influence for the learned study and devout application of the bible the lectures , however , aroused the ill-will of the other theologians and pastors of leipzig , and francke and his friends left the city , and with the aid of christian thomasius and spener founded the new university of halle spener died in 1705 , but the movement , guided by francke and fertilized from halle , spread through the whole of middle and north germany yet some claim that pietism contributed largely to the revival of biblical studies in germany and to making religion once more an affair of the heart and of life and not merely of the intellect rudolf sohm claimed that '' it was the last great surge of the waves of the ecclesiastical movement begun by the reformation ; it was the completion and the final form of the protestantism created by the reformation '' dietrich bonhoeffer of the german confessing church framed the same characterization in less positive terms when he called pietism the last attempt to save christianity as a religion : given that for him religion was a negative term , more or less an opposite to revelation , this constitutes a rather scathing judgment pietism , with its looser attitude toward confessional theology , had opened the churches to the possibility of uniting ( many immigrants to america , who agreed with the union movement , formed german evangelical lutheran and reformed congregations , later combined into the evangelical synod of north america , which is now a part of the united church of christ as such , laestadius '' spend the rest of his life advancing his idea of lutheran pietism , focusing his energies on marginalized groups in the northernmost regions of the nordic countries '' laestadius called on his followers to embrace their lutheran identity and as a result , laestadian lutherans have remained a part of the evangelical lutheran church of finland , the national church in that country , with some laestadian lutherans being consecrated as bishops laestadian lutherans observe the lutheran sacraments , holding classical lutheran theology on infant baptism and the real presence of christ in the eucharist , and also heavily emphasize confession mccormick , p 48 pietistic denominations in the united states included northern methodists , northern baptists , scandinavian lutherans , congregationalists , presbyterians , disciples of christ , and some smaller groups other works are : heinrich heppe , geschichte des pietismus und der mystik in der reformierten kirche ( 1879 ) , which is sympathetic ;
