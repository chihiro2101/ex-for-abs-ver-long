a typical high-purity grade of lanolin is composed predominantly of long chain waxy esters ( approximately 97 % by weight ) with the remainder being lanolin alcohols , lanolin acids and lanolin hydrocarbons an estimated 8,000 to 20,000 different types of lanolin esters are present in lanolin , resulting from combinations between the 200 or so different lanolin acids and the 100 or so different lanolin alcohols identified so far lanolin â€™ s complex composition of long-chain esters , hydroxyesters , diesters , lanolin alcohols , and lanolin acids means in addition to it being a valuable product in its own right , it is also the starting point for the production of a whole spectrum of lanolin derivatives , which possess wide-ranging chemical and physical properties lanolin derivatives obtained from these processes are used widely in both high-value cosmetics and dermatology products hydrolysis of lanolin yields lanolin alcohols and lanolin acids lanolin alcohols are a rich source of cholesterol ( an important skin lipid ) and are powerful water-in-oil emulsifiers ; they have been used extensively in skincare products for over 100 years new products obtained using complex purification techniques produce lanolin esters in their natural state , removing oxidative and environmental impurities resulting in white , odourless , hypoallergenic lanolin despite only being in force for a short period of time , this ruling did harm both to the lanolin industry and to the reputation of lanolin in general the cosmetics directive ruling only applied to the presence of lanolin in cosmetic products ; it did not apply to the many hundreds of its different uses in dermatological products designed for the treatment of compromised skin conditions skin bioengineering studies have shown the durational effect of the emollient ( skin smoothing ) action produced by lanolin is very significant and lasts for many hours lanolin applied to the skin at 2 & nbsp ; mg/cm 2 has been shown to reduce roughness by about 35 % after one hour and 50 % after two hours , with the overall effect lasting for considerably more than eight hours lanolin , when mixed with ingredients such as neatsfoot oil , beeswax and glycerol , is used in various leather treatments , for example in some saddle soaps and in leather care products lanolin is extracted by washing the wool in hot water with a special wool scouring detergent to remove dirt , wool grease ( crude lanolin ) , suint ( sweat salts ) , and anything else stuck to the wool
