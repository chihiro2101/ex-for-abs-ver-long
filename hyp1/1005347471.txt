al ( oh ) 3 is built up of double layers of hydroxyl groups with aluminium ions occupying two-thirds of the octahedral holes between the two layers nonetheless , both gibbsite and hydrargillite refer to the same polymorphism of aluminium hydroxide , with gibbsite used most commonly in the united states and hydrargillite used more often in europe aluminium hydroxide is amphoteric virtually all the aluminium hydroxide used commercially is manufactured by the bayer process which involves dissolving bauxite in sodium hydroxide at temperatures up to the waste solid , bauxite tailings , is removed and aluminium hydroxide is precipitated from the remaining solution of sodium aluminate this aluminium hydroxide can be converted to aluminium oxide or alumina by calcination aluminium hydroxide also finds use as a fire retardant filler for polymer applications magnesium hydroxide and mixtures of huntite and hydromagnesite are used similarly it decomposes at about , absorbing a considerable amount of heat in the process and giving off water vapour aluminium hydroxide is a feedstock for the manufacture of other aluminium compounds : speciality calcined aluminas , aluminium sulfate , polyaluminium chloride , aluminium chloride , zeolites , sodium aluminate , activated alumina , and aluminium nitrate vaccine formulations containing aluminium hydroxide stimulate the immune system by inducing the release of uric acid , an immunological danger signal
