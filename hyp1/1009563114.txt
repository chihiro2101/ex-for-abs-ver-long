menarche is the culmination of a series of physiological and anatomic processes of puberty : attainment of a sufficient body mass ( typically 17 % body fat ) over an interval of about 2 to 3 years , estrogen stimulates growth of the uterus ( as well as height growth , breast growth , widening of the pelvis , and increased regional adipose tissue ) no specific hormonal signal for menarche is known ; menarche as a discrete event is thought to be the relatively chance result of the gradual thickening of the endometrium induced by rising but fluctuating pubertal estrogen it is often scanty in amount and may be very brief , even a single instance of '' spotting '' like other menses , menarche may be accompanied by abdominal pain in most girls , menarche does not mean that ovulation has occurred in postmenarchal girls , about 80 % of the cycles were anovulatory in the first year after menarche , 50 % in the third and 10 % in the sixth year although unlikely , it is possible for a girl who has engaged in sexual intercourse shortly before her menarche to conceive and become pregnant , which would delay her menarche until after the end of the pregnancy a young age at menarche is not correlated with a young age at first sexual intercourse when menarche occurs , it confirms that the girl has had a gradual estrogen-induced growth of the uterus , especially the endometrium , and that the '' outflow tract '' from the uterus , through the cervix to the vagina , is open in very rare instances , menarche may occur at an unusually early age , preceding thelarche and other signs of puberty this is termed isolated premature menarche , but other causes of vaginal bleeding must be investigated and excluded isolated premature menarche is rarely the first manifestation of precocious puberty when menarche has failed to occur for more than three years after thelarche , or beyond 16 years of age , the delay is referred to as primary amenorrhea short stature , delayed growth in height and weight , and/or delayed menarche may be the only clinical manifestations of celiac disease , in absence of any other symptoms studies have been conducted to observe the association of the timing of menarche with various conditions and diseases a systematic review has concluded that early age at menarche is also a risk factor for the insulin resistance condition lack of exercise in childhood other research has focused on the effect of childhood stress on timing of puberty , especially female there is more uncertainty and mixed evidence as to whether milder degrees of stress or early-life under-nutrition can accelerate puberty in girls as would be predicted by life history theory and demonstrated in many other mammals statistical associations are not necessarily causal , and a variety of secondary variables and alternative explanations can be possibly intervening age at menarche for non-hispanic black girls was significantly earlier than that of white girls at 10 % , 25 % , and 50 % of those who had attained menarche , whereas non-white mexican american girls were only slightly earlier than the white girls at 25 % historically menstruation has been a social taboo and girls were taught about menarche and menstruation by their mothers or a female role model the girls who experience menarche wear special clothes and style their hair like the navajo goddess '' changing woman '' perhaps the most notable movie scene involving menarche is that from the horror movie carrie ( 1976 ) girls experiencing their first period is part of many movies , though not central to their plot , including the blue lagoon ( 1980 ) , the company of wolves ( 1984 ) , my girl ( 1991 ) , return to the blue lagoon ( 1991 ) , a walk on the moon ( 1999 ) .
