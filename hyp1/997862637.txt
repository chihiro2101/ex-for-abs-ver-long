radio clocks synchronized to a terrestrial time signal can usually achieve an accuracy within a hundredth of a second relative to the time standard , generally limited by uncertainties and variability in radio propagation some timekeepers , particularly watches such as some casio wave ceptors which are more likely than desk clocks to be used when travelling , can synchronise to any one of several different time signals transmitted in different regions radio clocks depend on coded time signals from radio stations list of radio time signal stations bipm annual report on time activities â€“ ftp : //ftp2.bipm.org/pub/tai/scale/timesignals/timesignals.pdf time signals , retrieved 2018 july 31 reception is generally better if the clock is placed near a window facing the transmitter a number of manufacturers and retailers sell radio clocks that receive coded time signals from a radio station , which , in turn , derives the time from a true atomic clock their model gc-1000 '' most accurate clock '' received shortwave time signals from radio station wwv in fort collins , colorado this oscillator was disciplined , meaning that the microprocessor-based clock used the highly accurate time signal received from wwv to trim the crystal oscillator these use signals transmitted by the appropriate transmitter for the country in which they are to be used ; l-band and vhf digital audio broadcasting : dab systems provide a time signal that has a precision equal to or better than digital radio mondiale but like fm rds do not indicate clock stratum ; digital radio mondiale : drm is able to send a clock signal , but one not as precise as navigation satellite clock signals many modern radio clocks use the global positioning system to provide more accurate time than can be obtained from terrestrial radio stations casio wave ceptor clock network speaking clock time from npl time transfer time synchronization in north america
