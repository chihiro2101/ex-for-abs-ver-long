the word tsetse means '' fly '' in tswana , a bantu language of southern africa recently , tsetse without the fly has become more common in english , particularly in the scientific and development communities tsetse flies can be seen as independent individuals in three forms : as third-instar larvae , pupae and as adults at the end of the pupal stage , tsetse emerge as adult flies the adults are relatively large flies , with lengths of , and have a recognizable shape or bauplan which makes them easy to distinguish from other flies tsetse have large heads , distinctly separated eyes , and unusual antennae procyclins are proteins developed in the surface coating of trypanosomes whilst in their tsetse fly vector other forms of human trypanosomiasis also exist but are not transmitted by tsetse animal trypanosomiasis , also called nagana when it occurs in cattle or horses or sura when it occurs in domestic pigs , is caused by several trypanosome species these diseases reduce the growth rate , milk productivity , and strength of farm animals , generally leading to the eventual death of the infected animals trypanosoma congolense and trypanosoma vivax are the two most important species infecting bovine cattle in sub-saharan africa other forms of animal trypanosomiasis are also known from other areas of the globe , caused by different species of trypanosomes and transmitted without the intervention of the tsetse fly the tsetse fly vector ranges mostly in the central part of africa trypanosomiasis poses a considerable constraint on livestock agricultural development in tsetse fly infested areas of sub saharan africa , especially in west and central africa human african trypanosomosis ( hat ) and animal african trypanosomosis ( aat ) are sufficiently important to make virtually any intervention against these diseases beneficial economic guidelines for strategic planning of tsetse and trypanosomiasis control in west africa , by a.p.m many techniques have reduced tsetse populations , with earlier , crude methods recently replaced by methods that are cheaper , more directed , and ecologically better while the fly eventually re-invaded in the 1950s , the new population of tsetse was free from the disease tsetse are also attracted to large dark colors like the hides of cow and buffaloes the sustainable removal of the tsetse fly is in many cases the most cost-effective way of dealing with the t & t problem resulting in major economic benefits for subsistence farmers in rural areas a project that was implemented from 1994 to 1997 on the island of unguja , zanzibar ( united republic of tanzania ) , demonstrated that , after suppression of the tsetse population with insecticides , sit completely removed the glossina austeni newstead population from the island the eradication of the tsetse fly from unguja island in 1997 was followed by the disappearance of the aat which enabled farmers to integrate livestock keeping with cropping in areas where this had been impossible before a '' tsetse suitability index '' was developed from insect population growth , climate and geospatial data to simulate the fly 's population steady state one conventional argument is that the tsetse fly made it difficult to use draught animals he published : a naturalist on lake victoria , with an account of sleeping sickness and the tse-tse fly ; 1920
