the suffix -man had the meaning '' person '' in old english ( see man ) , but in present-day english it is predominantly masculine thus job titles that include this suffix , such as fireman , salesman and alderman , generally imply that the holder is male a change to gender-neutral job titles can be controversial the case for switching to gender-neutral job titles usually makes an ideology argument , that gender-specific job titles at some level promote sexism in the workplace however , there are many ( in particular feminism ) who would claim that this argument is really a backlash against the argument for gender-neutral language whereas in the general case , there is often no appropriate singular gender-neutral replacement ( e.g the third person singular pronoun he , although the use of singular they is increasingly common ) , there are gender-neutral versions of nearly all job titles '' some usage guides , such as the cambridge guide to english usage , advocate gender-neutral language in circumstances where all sexes are meant to be included in the rare case where no useful gender-neutral alternative is available , they believe both male and female terms should be used the principle of gender-neutral language dictates that job titles that add suffixes to make them feminine should be avoided if gender is relevant , the words woman or female should be used instead of '' lady '' ( '' my grandmother was the first female doctor in the province '' ) , except if the masculine is '' lord '' ( as in '' landlady '' ) advisors on non-sexist usage deprecate terms such as '' male nurse '' , '' female doctor '' , '' male model '' , or '' female judge '' because such terms are often used when the gender is irrelevant
