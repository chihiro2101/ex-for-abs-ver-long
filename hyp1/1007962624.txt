in the southern hemisphere , the magellanic clouds have long been included in the lore of native inhabitants , including south sea islanders and indigenous australians between 1893 and 1906 , under the direction of solon bailey , the telescope at this site was used to survey photographically both the large and small magellanic clouds leavitt reaized that since all the stars in the smc are roughly the same distance from earth , this result implied that there is similar relationship between period and absolute brightness this important period-luminosity relation allowed the distance to any other cepheid variable to be estimated in terms of the distance to the smc using this period-luminosity relation , in 1913 the distance to the smc was first estimated by ejnar hertzsprung there is a bridge of gas connecting the small magellanic cloud with the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , which is evidence of tidal interaction between the galaxies in 2017 , using dark energy survey plus maglites data , a stellar over-density associated with the small magellanic cloud was discovered , which is probably the result of interactions between smc and lmc recent star formation has led to a large population of massive stars and high-mass x-ray binaries ( hmxbs ) which are the relics of the short-lived upper end of the initial mass function 2010 have now cataloged several hundred x-ray sources in the direction of the smc , of which perhaps half are considered likely hmxbs , and the remainder a mix of foreground stars , and background agn the fourth uhuru catalog lists an early x-ray source within the constellation tucana : 4u 0115-73 ( 3u 0115-73 , 2a 0116-737 , smc x-1 ) small magellanic cloud in fiction large magellanic cloud magellanic clouds objects within the small magellanic cloud : ngc 265 ngc 290 ngc 346 ngc 602
