there have been versions of a chinese state for around 4,000 years the chinese concept of the world was largely a division between the civilized world and the barbarian world and there was little concept of the belief that chinese interests were served by a powerful chinese state chinese nationalism as it emerged in the early 20th century was based on the experience of european nationalism , especially as viewed and interpreted by sun yat-sen the key factor in european nationalism was tradition – some of the newly manufactured – of a cultural identity based primarily on language and ethnicity chinese nationalism was rooted in the long historic tradition of china as the center of the world , in which all other states were offshoots and owed some sort of deference china and revolution : the first phase , 1900–1913 ( 1968 ) pp ethnic nationalism was , in any case , unacceptable to the ruling manchu elitethey were foreigners who conquered china and maintained their own language and traditions the discussion of modern chinese nationalism has dominated many political and intellectual debates since the late nineteenth century political scientist suisheng zhao argues that nationalism in china is not monolithic but exists in various forms , including political , liberal , ethnical , and state nationalism after the collapse of the qing regime and the founding of the republic of china in 1911 , concerns of both domestic and international threat made the role of racism decline , while anti-imperialism became the new dominant ideology of chinese nationalism over the 1910s he thus proposes to supplement the chinese communist ideology in the discussion of chinese nationalism , which he labels '' peasant nationalism '' chinese nationalism in the early twentieth century was primarily based on anti-manchurism , an ideology that was prevalent among chinese revolutionaries from late nineteenth century to the turn of the twentieth century wang jingwei , a chinese revolutionary who later became an important figure in the kuomintang , also believed that the manchus were an inferior race since the han had asserted its dominant role in chinese nationalism , the manchus had to be either absorbed or eradicated '' after the 1911 revolution , sun yat-sen established the republic of china , the national flag of which contained five colors with each symbolizing a major racial ethnicity of china while both japan and russia were encroaching china , the newly born republic also faced ethnic movements in mongolia and tibet which claimed themselves to be part of the qing empire rather than the republic of china pressured by both domestic and international problems , the fragile republican regime decided to maintain the borders of the qing empire to keep its territories intact in the context of social mobilization , chinese nationalism only fully emerged during the second sino-japanese war ( 1937-1945 ) , when the ccp mobilized the peasantry to fight against the japanese invaders the wartime alliance of the chinese peasantry and the ccp manifests how the nationalist ideology of the ccp , or the peasant nationalism , reinforced the desire of the chinese to save and build a strong nation during the 1960s and 1970s , chinese nationalism within mainland china became mixed with the rhetoric of marxism , and nationalistic rhetoric become in large part subsumed into internationalist rhetoric in the 1990s , rising economic standards , the dissolution of soviet union , and the lack of any other legitimizing ideology has led to what most observers see as a resurgence of nationalism within mainland china defining the relationship between ethnicity and the chinese identity has been a very complex issue throughout chinese history the main method by which they accomplished control of the chinese heartland was by portraying themselves as enlightened confucian sages part of whose goal was to preserve and advance chinese civilization over the course of centuries the manchus were gradually assimilated into the chinese culture and eventually many manchus identified themselves as a people of china it was during this time that the concept of han chinese came into existence as a means of describing the majority of chinese ethnicity due to sinicization in early chinese history in 1919 , the may fourth movement grew out of student protests to the treaty of versailles , especially its terms allowing japan to shandong problem surrendered by germany after the siege of tsingtao , and spurned upsurges of chinese nationalism amongst the protests the official chinese nationalistic view in the 1920s and 1930s was heavily influenced by modernism and social darwinism , and included advocacy of the cultural assimilation of ethnic groups in the western and central provinces into the '' culturally advanced '' han state , to become in name as well as in fact members of the chinese nation furthermore , it was also influenced by the fate of multi-ethnic states such as austria-hungary and the ottoman empire hu songshan , a muslim imam from ningxia , was a chinese nationalist and preached chinese nationalism and unity of all chinese

islamic sharia law which was set up by the uighurs , and set up martial law instead , retaining the former chinese officials and keeping them in power the uighurs had been promoting islamism in their separatist government , but ma hushan eliminated religion from politics while this was the commonly stated goal of both the people 's republic of china and the republic of china ( roc ) especially before 1991 , both sides differed sharply in the form of unification due to obvious and salient differences in political ideology despite this , the relationship between chinese nationalism and taiwan remains controversial , involving symbolic issues such as the use of '' the republic of china '' as the official name of the government on taiwan and the use of the word '' china '' in the name of government-owned corporations ( e.g chinese nationalism has had mutable relationships with chinese living outside of mainland china and taiwan after the end of world war ii , overseas chinese were encouraged or sometimes coerced to regard themselves as citizens of their adopted nations rather than as part of the wider ethnic chinese nationality '' textbooks for chinese schools are also
