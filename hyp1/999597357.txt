bohm was born in wilkes-barre , pennsylvania , to a hungarian jewish immigrant father , samuel bohm , - by the numbers – david bohm and a lithuanian jewish mother despite being raised in a jewish family , he became an agnostic in his teenage years bohm attended pennsylvania state college ( now pennsylvania state university ) , graduating in 1939 , and then the california institute of technology , for one year he then transferred to the theoretical physics group directed by robert oppenheimer at the university of california , berkeley radiation laboratory , where he obtained his doctorate bohm lived in the same neighborhood as some of oppenheimer 's other graduate students ( giovanni rossi lomanitz , joseph weinberg , and max friedman ) and with them became increasingly involved in radical politics he was active in communist and communist-backed organizations , including the young communist league , the campus committee to fight conscription , and the american peace mobilization during world war ii , the manhattan project mobilized much of berkeley 's physics research in the effort to produce the first atomic bomb during the war , bohm remained at berkeley , where he taught physics and conducted research in plasma , the synchrotron and the synchrocyclotron bohm later performed theoretical calculations for the calutrons at the y-12 facility in oak ridge , tennessee , which was used for the isotope separation electromagnetic for the bomb dropped on hiroshima in 1945 after the war , bohm became an assistant professor at princeton university bohm invoked his fifth amendment right to refuse to testify , and he refused to give evidence against his colleagues after his acquittal , bohm 's colleagues sought to have him reinstated at princeton , but princeton president harold w dodds russell olwell : physics and politics in cold war america : the two exiles of david bohm , working paper number 20 although einstein considered appointing him as his research assistant at the institute , oppenheimer ( who had served as the institute 's president since 1947 ) '' opposed the idea and : science and exile : david bohm , the cold war , and a new interpretation of quantum mechanics , hsps , vol as a postgraduate at berkeley , he developed a theory of plasmas , discovering the electron phenomenon now known as bohm diffusion his first book , quantum theory , published in 1951 , was well received by einstein , among others but bohm became dissatisfied with the orthodox interpretation of quantum theory he wrote about in that book de gosson , basil j bohm 's aim was not to set out a deterministic , mechanical viewpoint but to show that it was possible to attribute properties to an underlying reality , in contrast to the conventional approach he began to develop his own interpretation ( the de broglie–bohm theory , also called the pilot wave theory ) , the predictions of which agreed perfectly with the non-deterministic quantum theory he initially called his approach a hidden variable theory , but he later called it ontological theory , reflecting his view that a stochastic process underlying the phenomena described by his theory might one day be found bohm and his colleague basil hiley later stated that they had found their own choice of terms of an '' interpretation in terms of hidden variables '' to be too restrictive , especially since their variables , position , and momentum '' are not actually hidden '' david bohm , basil hiley : the undivided universe : an ontological interpretation of quantum theory , edition published in the taylor & francis e-library 2009 ( first edition routledge , 1993 ) , , p he applied for and received brazilian citizenship , but by law , had to give up his us citizenship ; he was able to reclaim it only decades later , in 1986 , after pursuing a lawsuit : science and exile : david bohm , the cold war , and a new interpretation of quantum mechanics , hsps , vol & nbsp ; 1–34 , issn 0890-9997 , 2005 at the university of são paulo , bohm worked on the causal theory that became the subject of his publications in 1952 from 1951 to 1953 , bohm and david pines published the articles in which they introduced the random phase approximation and proposed the plasmon in 1957 , bohm and his student yakir aharonov published a new version of the epr paradox , reformulating the original argument in terms of spin & nbsp ; 1070–1076 ( abstract ) it was that form of the epr paradox that was discussed by john stewart bell in his famous paper of 1964 in 1959 , bohm and aharonov discovered the aharonov–bohm effect , showing how a magnetic field could affect a region of space in which the field had been shielded , but its vector potential did not vanish there it was one of a series of seminars held by bohm at oak grove school , and it was published as thought as a system his final work , the posthumously-published the undivided universe : an ontological interpretation of quantum theory ( 1993 ) , resulted from a decades-long collaboration with basil hiley in the early 1950s , bohm 's causal quantum theory of hidden variables was mostly negatively received , with a widespread tendency among physicists to systematically ignore both bohm personally and his ideas the essential david bohm
