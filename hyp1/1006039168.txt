zirconium is one of the main components of zircon crystals , currently the oldest known minerals in the earth 's crust many later transition metals , such as rhodium , are very commonly used in jewelry due to the fact that they are incredibly shiny this period is known to have a large number of exceptions to the madelung rule rubidium is the first element placed in period 5 it is an alkali metal , the most reactive group in the periodic table , having properties and similarities with both other alkali metals and other period 5 elements rubidium also follows the trend of increasing reactivity as the atomic number increases in the alkali metals , for it is more reactive than potassium , but less so than caesium rubidium is very susceptible to redox in air , similar to most of the other alkali metals , so it readily transforms into rubidium oxide , a yellow solid with the chemical formula rb 2 o strontium is the second element placed in the 5th period it is an alkaline earth metal , a relatively reactive group , although not nearly as reactive as the alkali metals strontium is a soft metal and is extremely reactive upon contact with water yttrium is a chemical element with symbol y and atomic number 39 yttrium is almost always found combined with the lanthanides in rare earth minerals and is never found in nature as a free element johan gadolin discovered yttrium 's oxide in arrhenius ' sample in 1789 , yttrium krogt and anders gustaf ekeberg named the new oxide yttria zirconium is a chemical element with the symbol zr and atomic number 40 zirconium is mainly used as a refractory and opacifier , although minor amounts are used as alloying agent for its strong resistance to corrosion zirconium compounds have no biological role niobium , or columbium , is a chemical element with the symbol nb and atomic number 41 it is a soft , grey , ductile transition metal , which is often found in the pyrochlore mineral , the main commercial source for niobium , and columbite the german chemist heinrich rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element , which he named niobium in 1864 and 1865 , a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element ( as distinguished from tantalum ) , and for a century both names were used interchangeably niobium is used mostly in alloys , the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines these type-ii superconductor , also containing titanium and tin , are widely used in the superconducting magnets of mri scanners molybdenum is a group 6 chemical element with the symbol mo and atomic number 42 molybdenum does not occur as a free metal on earth , but rather in various oxidation states in minerals industrially , molybdenum compounds are used in high-pressure and high-temperature applications , as pigments and catalysis molybdenum minerals have long been known , but the element was '' discovered '' ( in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals ) in 1778 by carl wilhelm scheele technetium is the chemical element with atomic number 43 and symbol tc it is the lowest atomic number element without any stable isotopes ; every form of it is radioactive many of technetium 's properties were predicted by dmitri mendeleev before the element was discovered ruthenium usually occurs as a minor component of platinum ores and its annual production is only about 12 tonnes worldwide rhodium is a chemical element that is a rare , silvery-white , hard , and chemically inert transition metal and a member of the platinum group naturally occurring rhodium is found as the free metal , alloyed with similar metals , and never as a chemical compound rhodium is a so-called noble metal , resistant to corrosion , found in platinum- or nickel ores together with the other members of the platinum group metals the element 's major use ( about 80 % of world rhodium production ) is as one of the catalysts in the catalytic converter three-way of automobiles palladium is a chemical element with the chemical symbol pd and an atomic number of 46 silver is a metallic chemical element with the chemical symbol ag , from the indo-european root arg- for '' grey '' or '' shining '' ) and atomic number 47 indium is a chemical element with the symbol in and atomic number 49 tellurium is a chemical element that has the symbol te and atomic number 52 iodine is a chemical element with the symbol i and atomic number 53 in the universe and on earth , iodine 's high atomic number makes it a relatively rare element iodine is required by higher animals , which use it to synthesize thyroid hormones , which contain the element
