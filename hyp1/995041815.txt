the first known use in print of the term perfect game occurred in 1908 sanborn 's report for the chicago tribune about addie joss 's performance against the white sox calls it '' an absolutely perfect game , without run , without hit , and without letting an opponent reach first base by hook or crook , on hit , walk , or error , in nine innings '' this source also includes an 1880 clipping from the new york herald describing lee richmond 's perfect game for worcester a double error by cleveland resulted in the lone run scoring , and the writer described it as '' the only lapse from perfect play made by the clevelands during the game '' ; the use of the word '' perfect '' in this context refers only to defensive play , a different meaning than its modern baseball sense , as cleveland 's pitcher also surrendered three hits and a walk writeups for the ward perfect game of 1880 and the young game of 1904 describe the games as '' wonderful '' and other effusive terms , but do not use the term '' perfect game '' several sources have claimed that the first recorded usage of the term perfect game was by ernest lanigan in his baseball cyclopedia , made in reference to charlie robertson 's 1922 perfect game the baseball cyclopedia reference came in a supplement to the 1922 edition of the book ( a publication of baseball magazine ) and was worded thus : '' charles robertson of chicago americans pitched an absolutely perfect no-hit game against detroit on april 30 , 1922 , no one reaching first lanigan 's work references a 1914 book called balldom as a source for his list of perfect games , although balldom itself does not use the term '' perfect game '' , merely characterizing the games as '' no batter reached first base similarly , in writing up john montgomery ward 's 1880 perfect game , the new york clipper described the '' perfect play '' of providence 's defense as of 2014 , the current major league baseball definition of a perfect game is largely a side effect of the decision made by the major leagues ' committee for statistical accuracy on september 4 , 1991 , to redefine a no-hitter as a game in which the pitcher or pitchers on one team throw a complete game of nine innings or more without surrendering a hit there has been one perfect game in the world series , thrown by don larsen for the new york yankees against the brooklyn dodgers on october 8 , 1956 by coincidence , the second yankee pitcher to throw a perfect game , david wells in 1998 , graduated from the same high school as larsen - point loma high school in san diego , california in a further coincidence , larsen was in attendance when the third yankee pitcher to throw a perfect game , david cone in 1999 , performed the feat on the same day that larsen and yogi berra ( the catcher in the 1956 perfect game ) were invited to do the ceremonial first pitch the most recent perfect game pitched in major league baseball was thrown by félix hernández of the seattle mariners against the tampa bay rays on august 15 , 2012 armando galarraga 's near-perfect game eight-ender in curling for love of the game , a 1991 novel by pulitzer prize–winning author michael shaara golden set in tennis maximum break in snooker nine-dart finish in darts perfect game in bowling the perfect game , a 2009 movie the perfect game : a classic collection of facts , figures , stories and characters from the society for american baseball research ( taylor ) '' first perfect game in the major leagues '' , sports illustrated ( august 26 ; available online ) '' one out away from fame : the final out of hitless games has often proved to be a pitcher 's toughest conquest '' , baseball digest ( june ; available online )
