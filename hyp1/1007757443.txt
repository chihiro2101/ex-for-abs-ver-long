in monarchies with either an uncodified or partly unwritten constitution ( such as the united kingdom or canada ) or a wholly written constitution that consists of a text augmented by additional conventions , traditions , letters patent , etc in such an order , the reserve powers are thought to be the means by which the monarch and his or her viceregal representatives can legitimately exist as '' constitutional guardians '' or '' umpires '' , tasked with guaranteeing that cabinet and parliament adhere to the fundamental constitutional principles of the rule of law and responsible government itself some constitutional scholars , such as george winterton , have stated that reserve powers are a good thing in that they allow for a head of state to handle an unforeseen crisis and that the use of convention to limit the use of reserve powers allows for more gradual and subtle constitutional evolution than is possible through formal amendment of a written constitution in belgium a constitutional provision explicitly states that no act of the monarch is valid without the signature of a member or members of the government , which thereby becomes solely responsible , hence excluding any reserve power for the crown in legal terminology , a competence vested in 'the king ' thus very often means the government , as opposed to formal laws which require a ( sometimes qualified ) parliamentary majority constitutional precedence has even established the unwritten but binding rule that the monarch must give assent to any parliamentary decision , regardless of any other considerations ( which can only be advanced in private audience with government members , not imposed ) , as soon as the government presents it for royal signature and thus assumes full political responsibility in 1990 , when a law liberalising belgium 's abortion laws was approved by parliament , king baudouin refused to give his royal assent , only the second time in belgium 's history the monarch elected to do so instead , he requested that the cabinet declare him unable to reign for a day , which it did , thereby assuming the king 's constitutional powers within the dominions , until the 1920s , most reserve powers were exercised by a governor-general on the advice of either the local or the british government , though the latter took precedence for example , the first governor-general of the irish free state , tim healy , was instructed by the british dominions office in 1922 to withhold the royal assent on any bill passed by the two houses of the oireachtas ( the irish parliament ) that attempted to change or abolish the oath of allegiance by the time the oath was abolished by the irish parliament in 1933 , the irish governor-general was formally advised exclusively by the irish government while the reserve power to dismiss a government has not been used in the united kingdom since 1834 , this power has been exercised more recently in australia , on two occasions : on 13 may 1932 , when the governor of new south wales philip game lang dismissal crisis in queensland in 1987 , during a tense period of leadership succession , the governor of queensland , sir walter campbell , exercised reserve power in declining to follow the advice of the premier , sir joh bjelke-petersen cited in geoff barlow & jf corkery , '' sir walter campbell queensland governor and his role in premier joh bjelke-petersen 's resignation , 1987 '' , 23 barlow & corkery '' sir walter campbell '' , 28-29 these are among several exercises of the reserve powers in australia in the 20th century at state and federal levels the reserve powers in canada fall within the royal prerogative and belong specifically to the monarch , as the constitution act , 1867 , vests all executive power in the country 's sovereign at the provincial level , on 29 june 2017 lieutenant governor of british columbia judith guichon used her reserve powers to deny the request of premier christy clark to dissolve the legislature and call a new election only 51 days after the recent provincial election peter hogg , a constitutional scholar , has opined that '' a system of responsible government can not work without a formal head of state who is possessed of certain reserve powers as new zealand 's political system matured , the colonial office increasingly instructed the governors to follow the advice of local ministers , and the powers of the office have continually shrunk the governor-general has a number of reserve powers , which he or she may use on behalf of queen elizabeth ii the most visible reserve powers are the power to appoint a prime minister and the related power to accept a prime minister 's resignation this power is exercised every time a general election results in a change of government , most recently in 2017 it may also be exercised if a prime minister no-confidence motion and resigns instead of advising a dissolution of parliament ; the last such occasion was in 1912 though the power of appointment is listed among the reserve powers , in fact the governor-general abides by strict conventions , and has always appointed the leader of the dominant party in the house of representatives the governor-general may dismiss an incumbent prime minister and cabinet , an individual minister , or any other official who holds office '' during the queen 's pleasure '' or '' during the governor-general 's pleasure '' likewise , by convention , the government as a whole remains in office as long as it keeps the confidence of the house the governor-general can also dissolve parliament and call elections without prime ministerial advice however , all elections since responsible government was introduced , including snap elections , have been requested by the incumbent premier or prime minister , and are accordingly not examples of use of the reserve powers a prime minister who has lost the confidence of the house will conventionally either advise a dissolution of parliament and new elections , or tender his resignation likewise , if the prime minister tenders his resignation , the governor-general could theoretically refuse to accept it , and dissolve parliament against the prime minister 's advice see the lascelles principles for factors which might guide the governor-general in making a decision on whether or not to grant a dissolution in those circumstances a governor-general could also legally refuse a request for a snap election from a prime minister in whom the house has confidence , but such a refusal would be extremely unlikely there have been a handful of occasions when reserve powers were used , or at least considered the outgoing prime minister , sir rob muldoon , had just lost an election , but refused to advise the governor-general , david beattie , to make urgent regulations desired not only by the incoming prime minister , david lange , but also by many in muldoon 's own party and cabinet a constitutional crisis occurred in saint kitts and nevis in 1981 , when the governor , sir probyn inniss , used his reserve powers to refuse assent to a bill passed by the government of sir kennedy simmonds , the country 's premier inniss believed that the bill was unconstitutional , and would soon be struck down by the eastern caribbean supreme court the constitution of tuvalu provides , in article 52 , that the governor-general exercises his powers '' only in accordance with the advice of ( a ) the cabinet ; or ( b ) the prime minister except where he is required to act ( c ) in accordance with the advice of any other person or authority on 28 june , prime minister willy telavi 's government had lost a crucial by-election , which gave the opposition a majority of one in parliament '' tuvalu ’ s opposition waiting to hear from gg '' , islands business , 1 july 2013 prime minister telavi responded that , under the constitution , he was only required to convene parliament once a year ( for a vote on the budget ) , and was thus under no obligation to summon it until december this was last done in britain in 1963 when elizabeth ii appointed sir alec douglas-home as prime minister , on the advice of outgoing harold macmillan following japan 's defeat in world war ii , the emperor 's role is defined in chapter i of the 1947 constitution of japan , as decided by the foreign powers that had defeated japan in the war often minor parties form part of a larger major party , and through that membership it can be said that the king fulfills his constitutional mandate of consulting with party representatives with congressional representation the king , however , is not subordinate to the government and thus could play an independent role as moral authority , but the prevailing convention , expressed in the preparatory works of the 1974 instrument of government , is that the king should stay away from anything which could reasonably be interpreted as courtyard speech the president of ireland does not possess executive powers : executive powers are held by the government , which is headed by a taoiseach ( prime minister ) , who is chosen by and accountable to dáil éireann ( house of representatives )
