it read : the words '' allegiance to the constitution of the irish free state '' were taken from de valera 's preferred version , which read : '' i ( name ) do solemnly swear true faith and allegiance to the constitution of the irish free state , to the treaty of association , and to recognise the king of great britain as head of associated states michael collins : the man who made ireland , p ironically , in view of the opposition expressed to the oath by anti-treatyites , it was in fact largely the work of michael collins , based in its open lines on a draft oath suggested by the president of dáil éireann , éamon de valera , and also on the oath of the irish republican brotherhood the public perception among those who were hostile to the treaty was that it was an offensive oath due to its inclusion of the british monarch in their view : the oath was an acceptance of a common citizenship between ireland and britain under king george and therefore was in total contravention to the oath to the irish republic which they had previously taken dáil éireann – volume 3–19 december 1921 debate on treaty they rebutted the argument that it was simply an oath to the constitution by pointing out that the constitution itself made the king head of state and it was therefore the same as an oath of allegiance to him directly in contrast to this pro-treaty campaigners declared that : the oath of allegiance was actually '' true faith and allegiance to the constitution of the irish free state '' ( a line drafted by de valera in his own proposed oath ) the fidelity to the king was not to him as british monarch but '' in virtue of the common citizenship of ireland with great britain and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the british commonwealth of nations '' , in other words , in his role as the symbol of the treaty settlement , not as british king the collins 22 society later said of the anti-treaty position , the idea that the oath '' was a direct oath to the crown was a fact demonstrably incorrect by an examination of its wording an oath of allegiance to the english crown was required by the irish act of supremacy since the time of king henry viii ( 1537 ) following the 1782 relief act , which gave catholic schools a legal footing , teachers were required to take an oath of allegiance to the british crown
