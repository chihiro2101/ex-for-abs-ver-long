one monkey named helen could be considered the '' star monkey in visual research '' because she was the original blindsight subject furthermore , under certain experimental conditions , she could detect a variety of visual stimuli , such as the presence and location of objects , as well as shape , pattern , orientation , motion , and color subjects who had suffered damage to their visual cortices due to accidents or strokes reported partial or total blindness in spite of this , when they were prompted they could '' guess '' with above-average accuracy about the presence and details of objects , much like the animal subjects , and they could even catch objects that were tossed at them furthermore , blindsight subjects rarely express the amazement about their abilities that sighted people would expect them to express patients with blindsight have damage to the system that produces visual perception ( the visual cortex of the brain and some of the nerve fibers that bring information to it from the eyes ) rather than to the underlying brain system controlling eye movements hence , visual information can control behavior without producing a conscious sensation this ability of those with blindsight to act as if able to see objects that they are unconscious of suggests that consciousness is not a general property of all parts of the brain , but is produced by specialised parts of it blindsight patients show awareness of single visual features , such as edges and motion , but can not gain a holistic visual percept research has shown that visual stimuli with the single visual features of sharp borders , sharp onset/offset times , motion , and low spatial frequency contribute to , but are not strictly necessary for , an object 's salience in blindsight the stereoscopic information is attached to the object information passed to the visual cortex the monkeys were placed in front of a monitor and taught to indicate whether a stationary object or nothing was present in their visual field when a tone was played then the monkeys performed the same task except the stationary objects were presented outside of their visual field the monkeys performed very similar to human participants and were unable to perceive the presence of stationary objects outside of their visual field several years later , another study compared and contrasted the data collected from monkeys and that of a specific human patient with blindsight , gy by comparing the test results of both gy and the monkeys , the researchers concluded that similar patterns of responses to stimuli in the '' blind '' visual field can be found in both species however , more recent evidence point to a pathway from s-cones to the superior colliculus , opposing previous research and supporting the idea that some chromatic processing mechanisms are intact in blindsight similarly , another patient with unilateral lesion of area v1 could avoid obstacles placed in his blind field when he reached toward a target that was visible in his intact visual field even though he avoided the obstacles , he never reported seeing them he was able to misstate , as requested , in his left visual field ( with normal conscious vision ) ; but he tended to fail in the task—to state the location correctly—when the stimulus was in his blindsight ( right ) visual field the normal techniques that were used to assess visual acuity in humans involved asking them to verbally describe some visually recognizable aspect of an object or objects the discovery of the condition known as blindsight raised questions about how different types of visual information , even unconscious information , may be affected and sometimes even unaffected by damage to different areas of the visual cortex previous studies had already demonstrated that even without conscious awareness of visual stimuli humans could still determine certain visual features such as presence in the visual field , shape , orientation and movement but , in a newer study evidence showed that if the damage to the visual cortex occurs in areas above the primary visual cortex the conscious awareness of visual stimuli itself is not damaged so even when damage occurs in the area necessary for conscious awareness of visual information , other functions of the processing of these visual percepts are still available to the individual the same also goes for damage to other areas of the visual cortex prior studies have already shown that blindsight patients are able to detect motion even though they claim they do not see any visual percepts in their blind fields the subjects of the study were two patients who suffered from hemianopsia—blindness in more than half of their visual field however one of the subjects was not able to accurately determine whether or not blue dots were moving regardless of the brightness contrast , but he/she was able to do so with every other color dot kentridge , heywood , and weiskrantz used the phenomenon of blindsight to investigate the connection between visual attention and visual awareness they wanted to see if their subject—who exhibited blindsight in other studies —could react more quickly when his/her attention was cued without the ability to be visually aware of it destruction of the primary visual cortex leads to blindness in the part of the visual field that corresponds to the damaged cortical representation injury to the primary visual cortex , including lesions and other trauma , leads to the loss of visual experience
