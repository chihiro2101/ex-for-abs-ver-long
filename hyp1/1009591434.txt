a significant number of moorcock 's novels and short stories take place in one shared multiverse : a wide array of interconnected parallel universes , many-layered dimensions , spheres , and alternative worlds , which spans from the big bang to the end of time and from earth to faraway galaxies the eternal champion is , as a matter of fact , an appointed paladin of balance who is bound to exist in each and every world and age of the multiverse , so that law and chaos are perpetually kept in check ; however , he often does not know of his role , or , even worse , he struggles against it , never to succeed likewise , many champions are aided by an eternal companion and an eternal consort : a sidekick and a love interest who are themselves aspects of two semi-divine figures this recursivity through the multiverse is further underlined by the number of champions , companions , and mentor-figures to the champions moorcock has given the j and c initials , as a form of naming fil rouge ; in the same vein , many champions and companions belong to one branch or another of the extensive von bek dynasty space- and time-travels through the multiverse are in fact possible , to the point that one humanoid species called the eldrens is spread among many different worlds and ages and interacts with many different champions ; however , cosmic laws establish that no two eternal champions can coexist in the same situation , or the very fabric of reality would be severely damaged aubec , earl of malador : aubec debuted in a 1964 short story titled either '' the dream of earl aubec '' or '' master of chaos '' depending on the collection : he lives in the same world as elric of melniboné many generations before that character 's birth , serves as a national champion of the human kingdom of lormyria and is the paramour of the lormyrian monarch , queen eloarde moorcock planned a whole series about aubec 's wars against melniboné in order to ensure human independence , eventually reconnecting to elric 's saga as a direct prequel , but the project was eventually aborted ; consequently , '' the dream of earl aubec '' was reincorporated into elric 's series as a prologue captain oswald bastable : the main character and narrator of the nomad of time trilogy ( 1971-1981 ) , captain bastable is an officer of the british imperial army stationed in the raj in the early 20th century , until a series of time-travel incidents transports him into three different uchronia : a 1973 where the world wars have not been fought and the british empire is now encroached by decolonizing movements ; a 1904 where europe has been left in tatters by a precocious and even more devastating great war ; a 1941 where the british and german empires are firmly allied amelia underwood , a time traveler from the nineteenth century ; the couple 's courtship , relationship and shared adventures across time and space are the subject of a trilogy called the dancers at the end of time ( 1972-1976 ) ; this series is complemented by the legends at the end of time : five semi-autonomous short stories and novelettes taking place at the end of time , themselves composed in the late seventies ( with an additional sixth one being published in 2008 ) jerry cornelius : an adventurer and dimensional traveler moorcock created in the mid-sixties and developed for the following forty years , resulting in an early tetralogy of novels , the cornelius quartet ( 1968-1977 ) , a ponderous collection of short fiction , the lives and times of jerry cornelius ( 1976 ) , and a later hexalogy of novels , the cornelius calendar ( composed in two stages , 1976-1981 and 2002-2008 ) , with more tales in the working this series also includes two spin-off works , a doctor who licensed novel titled the coming of the terraphiles ( 2010 ) , whose captain cornelius is , in fact , jerry 's incarnation in the whoniverse ;

later on moorcock revised his solo works into a stand-alone series centered upon agent jerry cornell ( 1970-1980 ) , an overt parody of character tropes and clichés from ian fleming 's james bond series at the beginning of the novella '' the eternal champion '' ( 1962 ;
