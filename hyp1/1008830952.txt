balancing these competing requirements leads to optimal inventory levels , which is an ongoing process as the business needs shift and react to the wider environment inventory management involves a retailer seeking to acquire and maintain a proper merchandise assortment while ordering , shipping , handling , and related costs are kept in check it also involves systems and processes that identify inventory requirements , set targets , provide replenishment techniques , report actual and projected inventory status and handle all functions related to the tracking and management of material this would include the monitoring of material moved into and out of stockroom locations and the reconciling of the inventory balances it also may include abc analysis , lot tracking , cycle counting support , etc management of the inventories , with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution system , functions to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock holding and handling costs there are five basic reasons for keeping an inventory time – the time lags present in the supply chain , from supplier to user at every stage , requires that you maintain certain amounts of inventory to use in this lead time however , in practice , inventory is to be maintained for consumption during 'variations in lead time ' this can lead to stock accumulation , consider for example how goods consumed only in holidays can lead to accumulation of large stocks on the anticipation of future consumption so bulk buying , movement and storing brings in economies of scale , thus inventory appreciation in value – in some situations , some stock gains the required value when it is kept for some time to allow it reach the desired standard for consumption , or for production skus can be any combination of letters and numbers chosen , just as long as the system is consistent and used for all the products in the inventory while accountants often discuss inventory in terms of goods for sale , organizations – manufacturers , service providers and not-for-profits – also have inventories ( fixtures , furniture , supplies , etc manufacturers ' , distributors ' , and wholesalers ' inventory tends to cluster in warehouses stock ties up cash and , if uncontrolled , it will be impossible to know the actual level of stocks and therefore difficult to keep the costs associated with holding too much or too little inventory under control while the reasons for holding stock were covered earlier , most manufacturing organizations usually divide their '' goods for sale '' inventory into : raw materials – materials and components scheduled for use in making a product this may be vats of prepared food , filled cans not yet labeled or sub-assemblies of food components pp 29–35 “ strategic positioning of inventory to match demand in a capital projects supply chain ” , k inventory proportionality is the goal of demand-driven inventory management in such a case , there is no '' excess inventory '' , that is , inventory that would be left over of another product when the first product runs out the secondary goal of inventory proportionality is inventory minimization one early example of inventory proportionality used in a retail application in the united states was for motor fuel the motorists do not know whether they are buying gasoline off the top or bottom of the tank , nor need they care inventory proportionality is used to balance the inventories of the different grades of motor fuel , each stored in dedicated tanks , in proportion to the sales of each grade inventory proportionality minimizes the amount of excess inventory carried in underground storage tanks the use of inventory proportionality in the united states is thought to have been inspired by japanese just-in-time parts inventory management made famous by toyota motors in the 1980s those companies ( especially in metalworking ) attempted to achieve success through economies of scope - the gains of jointly producing two or more products in one facility however , the burgeoning need for financial reporting after 1900 created unavoidable pressure for financial accounting of stock and the management need to cost manage products became overshadowed the second formula then creates the new start point for the next period and gives a figure to be subtracted from the sales price to determine some form of sales-margin figure there are , in fact , so many things that can vary hidden under this appearance of simplicity that a variety of 'adjusting ' assumptions may be used these include : specific identification lower of cost or market weighted average cost moving-average cost fifo and lifo the ratio may not be able to reflect the usability of future production demand , as well as customer demand business models , including just in time ( jit ) inventory , vendor managed inventory ( vmi ) and customer managed inventory ( cmi ) , attempt to minimize on-hand inventory and increase inventory turns vmi and cmi have gained considerable attention due to the success of third-party vendors who offer added expertise and knowledge that organizations may not possess inventory management in modern days is online oriented and more viable in digital where 'one process ' factories exist , there is a market for the goods created , which establishes an independent market value for the good this effort , known as '' lean production '' will significantly reduce working capital tied up in inventory and reduce manufacturing costs ( see the toyota production system ) when a merchant buys goods from inventory , the value of the inventory account is reduced by the cost of goods sold ( cogs ) due to lifo 's potential to skew inventory value , uk gaap and ias have effectively banned lifo inventory accounting also known as distressed or expired stock , distressed inventory is inventory whose potential to be sold at a normal cost has passed or will soon pass
