however , the margrave wrote a letter of recommendation on may 22 , 1601 , so that marius could study in prague under tycho brahe , which he did for several months , although he may actually have worked directly with david fabricius instead of brahe himself during this time , he tutored other students in astronomy , including one baldassarre capra , with whom he wrote a book on a new star ( actually kepler 's supernova ) they observed in 1604 that year , he also built his own telescope and in november made observations of the galilean moons , slightly before galileo did himself , which became the source of a major dispute between the two capra published another book in 1607 which he actually plagiarised from galileo , and marius was implicated in the act due to his prior association with capra , even though this was after marius had left padua in 1614 , marius published his work mundus iovialis describing the planet jupiter and its moons ( he previously had published the discovery in 1611 in a local almanac ) because of galileo 's stature in the scientific community , for nearly 300 years , marius 's reputation was tainted by galileo 's accusations marius used the julian calendar , and that date is equivalent to january 8 , 1610 , in the gregorian one used by galileo , one day after galileo 's letter in which he first described the moons simon marius also observed the andromeda galaxy , which had also been known to persian astronomers of the middle ages the stellar disks he observed were spurious ( likely the airy disk caused by diffraction , as stars are too distant for their physical disks to be detected telescopically ) , but marius interpreted them to be physical disks , like the planetary disks visible through a telescope prickard ) , '' the mundus jovialis of simon marius '' , the observatory ( astronomy ) , vol
