mayapan is 4.2 square kilometers ( about 1.6 square miles ) and has over 4000 structures , most of them residences , packed into this compound within the city walls built-up areas extend a half kilometer beyond the city walls in all directions the stone perimeter wall has twelve gates , including seven major gates with vaulted entrances the wall is 9.1 & nbsp ; km ( about 5.65 miles ) long and is roughly ovate with a pointed northeast corner the ceremonial center has a tightly packed cluster of temples , colonnaded halls , oratories , shrines , sanctuaries , altars , and platforms ( for oration , dancing , or stela display ) smith , an archeologist with the carnegie institute , estimated 10–12,000 people lived within the walled city gregory simons survey outside the city walls , there were numerous additional dwellings and he revised the total population estimate to between 15,000–17,000 people people living outside of the city wall engaged in agriculture , animal-raising , and specialized activities such as lime production the temple of kukulcan , a large pyramid also known as the castillo , is the main temple in mayapan however , the mayapan temple appears to be an inferior imitation of the one at chichen itza , and the city 's buildings in general are not constructed as well as those in other mayan cities for example , most or all of the vaulted roofs in mayapan have collapsed , while many of the better-built buildings at chichen itza remain intact other major temples in the ceremonial center include three round ones , which are unusual for the maya area and are also linked to the deity kukulkan/quetzalcoatl in his wind god ( ehecatl ) aspect he convened the lords of the region , who agreed to found a new capital at mayapan the ethnohistorical sources recount multiple different histories of the rise and fall of mayapan ( roys 1962 ) for example , some sources say that the maya revolted in 1221 against the maya-toltec lords of chichen itza they decided to build a new capital city near the town of telchaquillo , hometown of hunac ceel , the general who defeated the rulers of chichen itza the new city was built within a defensive wall and named mayapan , meaning '' standard of the maya people '' mexican mercenaries from tabasco were also employed to keep order and maintain power another family , the xiu , may have been living in the mayapan area prior to the arrival of the cocom ; the xiu claim to be a part of the lineage from uxmal below the two primary officials were many other officials with varying responsibilities the first was of the q-152 round temple , and the second was of the pyramid of kukulkan he was the first in a long string of explorers who drew the ruins of mayapan the first large-scale archeological site surveys were not conducted until 1938 by r.t eric thompson conducted five years of intensive archeological investigations at mayapan their work was published in a mimeographed series of current reports the current reports have recently been republished in their entirety by the university of colorado press ( john weeks 2009 ) the final report was published by the carnegie institution as mayapan , yucatan , mexico , by h brown of tulane university carried out excavations in the residential zones of mayapan as part of his doctoral dissertation research site chronology based on ceramics : charcoal was found on the upper floor of one of the temples that was dated to a.d however , two of these dates come from inexact sources the early date would suggest that this temple was built and in use in mayapan 's early history charcoal found in the early construction phase of the site 's main pyramid was dated a.d it is important for suggesting that the post-classical phase in mayapan started earlier than a.d mayapan 's settlement pattern radiated outwards to its fringes over time ; many of the later dates are from materials outside of the main group of ruins the fall of the city is tentatively dated around a.d diego de landa calderon , yucatán before and after the conquest , 1937 ( reprinted in 2008 ) see : abridged history of yucatan , pp mayapan yucatan mexico , h.e.d 8 kukulcan 's realm : urban life at ancient mayapán , marilyn masson & carlos peraza lope , university press of colorado 2014 , chapter 8 : militarism , misery and collapse today farmers use mixed fields , called the milpa fields , to cultivate maize , beans , squash , watermelons , mangoes , papayas and other crops peraza lope in 2008 looked at faunal remains from two different middens , one located in the monumental center by some houses , and the other is located in the domestic area outside the monumental compound the largest samples of recognized remains within the monumental center were from : white-tailed deer ( 23 % ) , dog ( 4.4 % ) , turkey ( 12.9 % ) , and iguana ( 10.2 % ) these percentages as well as the ones that will follow for the settlement zone are based on recognized remains in the settlement zone , researchers found : white-tailed deer ( 8.4 % ) , dog ( 1.4 % ) , turkey ( 5.3 % ) , iguana ( 14.5 % ) , and fish ( 3.6 % ) both turtle and rabbit remains were found in both sites , but they were consumed in small amounts ( less than 1.5 % ) they concluded that the fish were being traded into mayapan , and not collected near the site if the fish had been prepared at the site , the heads would have been common refuse within the ceremonial center , numerous deer heads and teeth were found among the remains topoxte in lake yaxha , peten also shares similarities of architecture and artifacts of effigy censers also , tiny “ dwarf ” shrines found at this site were very similar to shrines found at mayapan architectural and artifact connections are seen between mayapan and the utatlan in highland guatemala the east coast sites exported products such as cotton , salt , and honey from the yucatán aztecs , central mexico , and the campeche coast directionality may have played a role in the representation of inequality among the powerful factions of mayapan many of these tandem structures include multiple residential buildings ; the size of these residential buildings , relative to each other , suggests that some of them were for slaves this is shown in relation to the analysis of household oratarios and those oriented around the ceremonial center of mayapan unfortunately there is very little skeletal evidence found in this region because of the composition of the soil there are at least two examples of obsidian workshops in mayapan ( 2009 ) '' appendix : inventory and lot descriptions '' carnegie institution current reports on mayapan milbrath , susan and carlos peraza lope ( 2003 ) milbrath , susan , carlos peraza lope , and miguel delgado kú 2010 religious imagery in mayapan ’ s murals in royal courts of the maya , volume ii , edited by takeshi inomata y stephen d
