however , the margrave wrote a letter of recommendation on may 22 , 1601 , so that marius could study in prague under tycho brahe , which he did for several months , although he may actually have worked directly with david fabricius instead of brahe himself by september 1601 , marius had already left prague and he arrived in padua in december 1601 to study medicine at the university of padua during this time , he tutored other students in astronomy , including one baldassarre capra , with whom he wrote a book on a new star ( actually kepler 's supernova ) they observed in 1604 that year , he also built his own telescope and in november made observations of the galilean moons , slightly before galileo did himself , which became the source of a major dispute between the two capra published another book in 1607 which he actually plagiarised from galileo , and marius was implicated in the act due to his prior association with capra , even though this was after marius had left padua in 1614 , marius published his work mundus iovialis describing the planet jupiter and its moons ( he previously had published the discovery in 1611 in a local almanac ) marius used the julian calendar , and that date is equivalent to january 8 , 1610 , in the gregorian one used by galileo , one day after galileo 's letter in which he first described the moons simon marius also observed the andromeda galaxy , which had also been known to persian astronomers of the middle ages 460â€“462 marius drew conclusions about the structure of the universe from his observations of the jovian moons and the stellar disks he also concluded from his observations of the galilean moons that they must orbit jupiter while jupiter orbits the sun
