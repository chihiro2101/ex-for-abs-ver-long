otherwise , the incision is made over mcburney 's point ( one-third of the way from the anterior superior iliac spine to the navel ) , which represents the most common position of the base of the appendix as the two run at right angles to each other , this reduces the risk of later incisional hernia some surgeons choose to bury the stump of the appendix by inverting it so it points into the caecum the standardization of an incision is not best practice when performing an appendectomy given that the appendix is a mobile organ a physical exam should be performed prior to the operation and the incision should be chosen based on the point of maximal tenderness to palpation many surgeons have attempted to reduce incisional morbidity and improve cosmetic outcomes in laparoscopic appendectomy by using fewer and smaller ports described moving laparoscopic incisions to hide them in the natural camouflages like the suprapubic hairline to improve cosmesis additionally , reports in the literature indicate that minilaparoscopic appendectomy using 2â€“ or 3-mm or even smaller instruments along with one 12-mm port minimizes pain and improves cosmesis most importantly , it is easy to convert sils to conventional laparoscopy by adding a few trocars ; this conversion to conventional laparoscopy is called 'port rescue ' the additional problem of decreased exposure and the added financial burden of procuring special articulating or curved coaxial instruments exist there is a natural elevation in white blood cell count in addition to anatomical changes of the appendix that occur during pregnancy schwartz book of general surgery the risk of fetal death in the perioperative period after an appendectomy for early acute appendicitis is 3 to 5 % one area of concern related to the la during pregnancy is pneumoperitoneum one of the most common post-operative complications associated with an appendectomy is the development of a surgical site infection ( ssi ) tenderness extending beyond the redness that surrounds the incision , in addition to the development of cutaneous vesicles or bullae may be indicative of a deep ssi patients with complicated appendicitis ( perforated appendicitis ) are more likely to develop a ssi , abdominal abscess , or pelvic abscess during the post-operative period harry hancock performed the first abdominal surgery for appendicitis in 1848 , but he did not remove the appendix
