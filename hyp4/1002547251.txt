one monkey named helen could be considered the '' star monkey in visual research '' because she was the original blindsight subject helen was a macaque monkey that had been decorticated ; specifically , her primary visual cortex ( v1 ) was completely removed , blinding her furthermore , under certain experimental conditions , she could detect a variety of visual stimuli , such as the presence and location of objects , as well as shape , pattern , orientation , motion , and color subjects who had suffered damage to their visual cortices due to accidents or strokes reported partial or total blindness patients with blindsight have damage to the system that produces visual perception ( the visual cortex of the brain and some of the nerve fibers that bring information to it from the eyes ) rather than to the underlying brain system controlling eye movements the phenomenon shows how , after the more complex perception system is damaged , people can use the underlying control system to guide hand movements towards an object even though they can not see what they are reaching for hence , visual information can control behavior without producing a conscious sensation this suggests that perceptual awareness is modular and that—in sighted individuals—there is a '' binding process that unifies all information into a whole percept '' , which is interrupted in patients with such conditions as blindsight and visual agnosia therefore , object identification and object recognition are thought to be separate processes and occur in different areas of the brain , working independently from one another the modular theory of object perception and integration would account for the '' hidden perception '' experienced in blindsight patients research has shown that visual stimuli with the single visual features of sharp borders , sharp onset/offset times , motion , and low spatial frequency contribute to , but are not strictly necessary for , an object 's salience in blindsight the first states that after damage to area v1 , other branches of the optic nerve deliver visual information to the superior colliculus and several other areas , including parts of the cerebral cortex another explanation for the phenomenon of blindsight is that even though the majority of a person 's visual cortex may be damaged , tiny islands of functioning tissue remain the stereoscopic information is attached to the object information passed to the visual cortex ( 2004 ) processes in biological vision section 7.4 evidence of blindsight can be indirectly observed in children as young as two months , although there is difficulty in determining the type in a patient who is not old enough to answer questions in a 1995 experiment , researchers attempted to show that monkeys with lesions in or even wholly removed striate cortexes also experienced blindsight then the monkeys performed the same task except the stationary objects were presented outside of their visual field another 1995 study by the same group sought to prove that monkeys could also be conscious of movement in their deficit visual field despite not being consciously aware of the presence of an object there to do this , researchers used another standard test for humans which was similar to the previous study except moving objects were presented in the deficit visual field this showed that the monkey 's ability to detect movement is separate from their ability to consciously detect an object in their deficit visual field , and gave further evidence for the claim that damage to the striate cortex plays a large role in causing the disorder several years later , another study compared and contrasted the data collected from monkeys and that of a specific human patient with blindsight , gy gy 's striate cortical region was damaged through trauma at the age of eight , though for the most part he retained full functionality , gy was not consciously aware of anything in his right visual field by comparing the test results of both gy and the monkeys , the researchers concluded that similar patterns of responses to stimuli in the '' blind '' visual field can be found in both species this ability to detect stimuli that the observer is not conscious of can extend to discrimination of the type of stimulus ( for example , whether an ' x ' or ' o ' has been presented in the blind field ) a 2011 study found that a young woman with a unilateral lesion of area v1 could scale her grasping movement as she reached out to pick up objects of different sizes placed in her blind field , even though she could not report the sizes of the objects similarly , another patient with unilateral lesion of area v1 could avoid obstacles placed in his blind field when he reached toward a target that was visible in his intact visual field the discovery of the condition known as blindsight raised questions about how different types of visual information , even unconscious information , may be affected and sometimes even unaffected by damage to different areas of the visual cortex but , in a newer study evidence showed that if the damage to the visual cortex occurs in areas above the primary visual cortex the conscious awareness of visual stimuli itself is not damaged blindsight is a phenomenon that shows that even when the primary visual cortex is damaged or removed a person can still perform actions guided by unconscious visual information so even when damage occurs in the area necessary for conscious awareness of visual information , other functions of the processing of these visual percepts are still available to the individual destruction of the primary visual cortex leads to blindness in the part of the visual field that corresponds to the damaged cortical representation people with damage to v1 report no conscious vision , no visual imagery , and no visual images in their dreams evidence also suggests that , following a traumatic injury to v1 , there is still a direct pathway from the retina through the lgn to the extrastriate visual areas
