critical chain project management is based on methods and algorithms derived from theory of constraints according to studies of traditional project management methods by standish group and others as of 1998 , only 44 % of projects typically finish on time harvey maylor , project management in a project plan , the critical chain is the sequence of both precedence- and resource-dependent tasks that prevents a project from being completed in a shorter time , given finite resources lack of search for an optimum solution—a '' good enough '' solution is enough because : as far as is known , there is no analytical method for finding an absolute optimum ( i.e , having the overall shortest critical chain ) critical chain project management uses buffer management instead of earned value management to assess the performance of a project some project managers feel that the earned value management technique is misleading , because it does not distinguish progress on the project constraint ( i.e event chain methodology can determine a size of project , feeding , and resource buffers the longest sequence of resource-leveled tasks that lead from beginning to end of the project is then identified as the critical chain the '' extra '' duration of each task on the critical chain—the difference between the '' safe '' durations and the 50 % durations—is gathered in a buffer at the end of the project because task duration has been planned at the 50 % probability duration , there is pressure on resources to complete critical chain tasks as quickly as possible , overcoming student 's syndrome and parkinson 's law a fever chart or similar graph can be created and posted to show the consumption of buffer as a function of project completion
