armadillo aerospace designed and built more than 12 vehicles which used about 50 engine designs for over 100 rocket flights armadillo stated a preference for simplicity and reliability over performance , which was evident in its choice of hydrogen peroxide ( 50 % concentration in water ) and methanol as a mixed monopropellant for the vehicle armadillo aerospace competed in the 2006 x prize cup armadillo aerospace was the only competitor in the lunar lander challenge the quad vehicle design is pressure-fed in blow down mode from an initial pressure of 320 psi for level 1 ( 400 psi level 2 ) armadillo aerospace competed in the 2007 lunar lander challenge event in the wirefly x-prize cup 2007 texel crash video the vehicle was irreparably damaged , and only its sister pixel could compete in the upcoming event the plan was to have the first module ( of the next generation modular design ) compete at level 1 , and have pixel compete at level 2 challenge in the level 1 events , armadillo 's craft mod ( actually , module 1 ) logged several attempts , including several successful first leg flights , but was unable to complete the return trip during any attempt on its first attempt , a clogged igniter orifice prevented ignition as the vehicle was still flying , carmack flew the crippled vehicle through the course as quickly as possible and hovered 2â€“3 meters above the landing pad on the final attempt , mod suffered a violent '' hard start '' , resulting in engine explosion armadillo aerospace competed for the third year but for the first time had competition , from the truezer0 team on their second attempt they completed the first leg , but the second leg was cut short by the faa closing the flight window armadillo 's attempt at the level 2 prize on october 25 was aborted due to their vehicle toppling over after the engine casing burned through due to a fuel-line problem '' armadillo aerospace - news archive in april 2008 , carmack offered an updated figure of '' total cost to date , about 3.5 million '' armadillo aerospace - news archive by 2010 , armadillo had 7 full-time employees , and was profitable on ongoing operations ( though carmack was continuing to invest in development efforts ) in 2015 the assets of armadillo aerospace were sold to exos aerospace '' -- june 2006 armadillo aerospace update june 2006 armadillo aerospace update
