the first debate in crowd psychology began in rome at the first international congress of criminal anthropology on 16 november 1885 anguilli called attention to the importance of the influence of the social environment upon crime '' the psychology of crowd dynamics '' , blackwell handbook of social psychology : group processes it is in this context that you have a debate between scipio sighele , an italian lawyer and gabriel tarde , a french magistrate on how to determine criminal responsibility in the crowd and hence who to arrest ( sighele , 1892 ; tarde , 1890 , 1892 , 1901 ) literature on crowds and crowd behavior appeared as early as 1841 , with the publication of charles mackay 's book extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds the attitude towards crowds underwent an adjustment with the publication of hippolyte taine 's six-volume the origins of contemporary france ( 1875 ) while it is difficult to directly link his works to crowd behavior , it may be said that his thoughts stimulated further study of crowd behavior however , it was not until the latter half of the 19th century that scientific interest in the field gained momentum there is limited research into the types of crowd and crowd membership and there is no consensus as to the classification of types of crowds two recent scholars , momboisse ( 1967 ) and berlonghi ( 1995 ) focused upon purpose of existence to differentiate among crowds berlonghi classified crowds as spectator , demonstrator , or escaping , to correlate to the purpose for gathering another approach to classifying crowds is sociologist herbert blumer 's system of emotional intensity that is , a crowd changes its level of emotional intensity over time , and therefore , can be classed in any one of the four types active crowds can be further divided into aggressive , escapist , acquisitive , or expressive mobs le bon held that crowds existed in three stages : submergence , contagion , and suggestion in le bon 's view , this effect is capable of spreading between '' submerged '' individuals much like a disease suggestion refers to the period in which the ideas and emotions of the crowd are primarily drawn from a shared unconscious ideology crowd members become susceptible to any passing idea or emotion it is limited by the moral and cognitive abilities of the least capable members in short , the individual submerged in the crowd loses self control as the '' collective mind '' takes over and makes the crowd member capable of violating personal or social norms le bon 's idea that crowds foster anonymity and generate emotion has been contested by some critics clark mcphail points out studies which show that '' the madding crowd '' does not take on a life of its own , apart from the thoughts and intentions of members additionally , le bon 's theory ignores the socio-cultural context of the crowd , which some theorists argue can disempower social change brown disputes the assumption that crowds are homogenous , suggesting instead that participants exist on a continuum , differing in their ability to deviate from social norms sigmund freud 's crowd behavior theory primarily consists of the idea that becoming a member of a crowd serves to unlock the unconscious mind this occurs because the super-ego , or moral center of consciousness , is displaced by the larger crowd , to be replaced by a charismatic crowd leader mcdougall argues similarly to freud , saying that simplistic emotions are widespread , and complex emotions are rarer convergence theory holds that crowd behavior is not a product of the crowd , but rather the crowd is a product of the coming together of like-minded individuals in crowds which are more ambiguous , individuals will assume a new social identity as a member of the crowd a concern with this theory is that while it explains how crowds reflect social ideas and prevailing attitudes , it does not explain the mechanisms by which crowds enact to drive social change jaap van ginneken , crowds , psychology and politics 1871â€“1899 , new york : cambridge university press , 1992
