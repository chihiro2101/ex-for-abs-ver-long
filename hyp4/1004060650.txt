thompson was born in rural woburn , massachusetts , on march 26 , 1753 ; his birthplace is preserved as a museum while recuperating in woburn in 1769 from an injury , thompson conducted experiments concerning the nature of heat and began to correspond with loammi baldwin and others about them her father was a minister , and her late husband left her property at concord , new hampshire , then called rumford when the american revolutionary war began thompson was a man of property and standing in new england and was opposed to the uprising thompson was welcomed by the british to whom he gave valuable information about the american forces , and became an advisor to both thomas gage and lord george germain image : englischer garten fg02.jpg thumb the beer garden '' am chinesischen turm '' in the englischer garten in munich in 1785 , he moved to bavaria where he became an aide-de-camp to the prince-elector charles theodore he also invented rumford 's soup , a soup for the poor , and established the cultivation of the potato in bavaria he devised a method for measuring the specific heat of a solid substance but was disappointed when johan wilcke published his parallel discovery first rumford 's most important scientific work took place in munich , and centred on the nature of heat , which he contended in '' an experimental enquiry concerning the source of the heat which is excited by friction '' ( 1798 ) was not the caloric of then-current scientific thinking but a form of motion rumford had observed the frictional heat generated by boring cannon at the arsenal in munich rumford immersed a cannon barrel in water and arranged for a specially blunted boring tool rumford argued that the seemingly indefinite generation of heat was incompatible with the caloric theory rumford made no attempt to further quantify the heat generated or to measure the mechanical equivalent of heat he did experiments to support his theories of calorific and frigorific radiation and said the communication of heat was the net effect of calorific ( hot ) rays and frigorific ( cold ) rays and the rays emitted by the object when an object absorbs radiation from a warmer object ( calorific rays ) its temperature rises , and when it absorbs radiation from a colder object ( frigorific rays ) its temperature falls the rumford fireplace created a sensation in london when he introduced the idea of restricting the chimney opening to increase the updraught , which was a much more efficient way to heat a room than earlier fireplaces upon his death , his daughter from his first marriage , sarah thompson , inherited his title as countess rumford rumford street ( and the nearby rumford place ) in liverpool , england , are so named due to a soup kitchen established to count rumford 's plan which formerly stood on land adjacent to rumford street collected works of count rumford , volume i , the nature of heat , ( 1968 ) collected works of count rumford , volume ii , practical applications of heat , ( 1969 )
