laboratories used for scientific research take many forms because of the differing requirements of specialists in the various fields of science and engineering a physics laboratory might contain a particle accelerator or vacuum chamber , while a metallurgy laboratory could have apparatus for casting or refining metals or for testing their strength a chemist or biology might use a wet laboratory , while a psychology laboratory might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior in some laboratories , such as those commonly used by computer scientists , computers ( sometimes supercomputers ) are used for either simulations or the analysis of data engineers use laboratories as well to design , build , and test technological devices scientific laboratories can be found as research room and learning spaces in schools and university , industry , government , or military facilities , and even aboard ships and spacecraft one distinctive feature of work in open labs is phenomena of translation , driven by the different backgrounds and levels of expertise of the people involved for the purposes of research , teaching , or analysis ; ( also ) one in which chemicals or drugs are manufactured '' the emergence of big science during world war ii increased the size of laboratories and scientific equipment , introducing particle accelerators and similar devices the earliest laboratory according to the present evidence is a home laboratory of pythagoras of samos , the well-known greek philosopher and scientist this laboratory was created when pythagoras conducted an experiment about tones of sound and vibration of string in the painting of louis pasteur by albert edelfelt in 1885 , louis pasteur is shown comparing a note in his left hand with a bottle filled with a solid in his right hand , and not wearing any personal protective equipment laboratory techniques are the set of procedures used on natural sciences such as chemistry , biology , physics to conduct an experiment , all of them follow the scientific method ; while some of them involve the use of complex laboratory equipment from laboratory glassware to electrical devices , and others require more specific or expensive supplies laboratory equipment refers to the various tools and equipment used by scientists working in a laboratory : the classical equipment includes tools such as bunsen burners and microscopes as well as specialty equipment such as operant conditioning chambers , spectrophotometers and calorimeters the title of laboratory is also used for certain other facilities where the processes or equipment used are similar to those in scientific laboratories rules exist to minimize the individual 's risk , and safety equipment is used to protect the lab users from injury or to assist in responding to an emergency the occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) in the united states , recognizing the unique characteristics of the laboratory workplace , has tailored a standard for occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals in laboratories many schools and businesses employ safety , health , and environmental specialists , such as a chemical hygiene officer ( cho ) to develop , manage , and evaluate their chp a locator is an employee of a laboratory who is in charge of knowing where each member of the laboratory currently is , based on a unique signal emitted from the badge of each staff member
