there are two dimensions in aiming a weapon : in the horizontal plane ( azimuth ) ; and in the vertical plane ( elevation ) , which is governed by the distance ( range ) to the target and the energy of the propelling charge , are indirect ) , and guns mounted in aircraft are examples of weapons primarily designed for direct fire nato defines indirect fire as '' fire delivered at a target which can not be seen by the aimer hence indirect fire means applying 'firing data ' to azimuth and elevation sights and laying these sights indirect fire can be used when the target is visible from the firing position longer range uses a higher trajectory , and in theory maximum range is achieved with an elevation angle of 45 degrees indirect fire is most commonly associated with field artillery ( although field artillery was originally and until after world war i a direct fire weapon , hence the bullet-shields fitted to the carriages of guns such as the famous m1897 75 & nbsp ; mm ) and mortars it is also used with naval guns against shore targets , sometimes with machine guns , and has been used with tank and anti-tank guns and by anti-aircraft guns against surface targets it is reasonable to assume that original purpose of indirect fire was to enable fire from a 'covered position ' , one where gunners can not be seen and engaged by their enemies ( that and as the range of artillery lengthened , it was impossible to see the target past all the intervening terrain ) the concealment aspect remains important , but from world war i equally important was the capability to concentrate the fire of many artillery batteries at the same target or set of targets this became increasingly important as the range of artillery increased , allowing each battery to have an ever-greater area of influence , but required command and control arrangements to enable concentration of fire if the target can not be seen from the gun position , there has to be a means of identifying targets and correcting aim according to fall of shot it is also reasonable conjecture that if these mortars were used from inside fortifications their targets may have been invisible to them and therefore met the definition of indirect fire guk , published field artillery fire from covered positions that described a better method of indirect laying ( instead of aiming points in line with the target ) indirect fire needs a command and control arrangement to allot guns to targets and direct their fire there are two approaches to the azimuth that orients the guns of a battery for indirect fire
