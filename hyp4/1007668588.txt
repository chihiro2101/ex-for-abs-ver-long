the aire and calder is a canalisation of the river calder from wakefield to castleford , where it joins the branch from leeds , which follows the river aire the aire continues to flow eastwards to bank dole junction , then continues in a north-easterly direction to haddlesey , from where it follows a winding course to join the river ouse at airmyn the section below haddlesey is no longer part of the navigation , as a derelict lock blocks access to the lower river instead , the selby canal flows northwards from haddlesey to the ouse at selby below dole bank junction , the knottingley and goole canal flows eastwards to join the ouse at goole the aire and calder still fulfils its original purpose of linking leeds and wakefield with york and the humber ( and thence the trent ) , although the routes by which this is achieved have changed significantly beyond leeds , the leeds and liverpool canal carries boats over the pennines the calder and hebble navigation , which connects to the navigation at wakefield , allows boats to reach the huddersfield broad and narrow canals , and the rochdale canal the selby canal connects to the ouse , from where boats can travel upstream to reach york , boroughbridge and ripon , or downstream to the river derwent in the early 1600s , the river aire was navigable to knottingley , and boats carrying up to 30 & nbsp ; tons traded on the river , which was tidal up to this point it named 18 undertakers , nine from the corporation of leeds , and nine '' gentlemen of wakefield '' , who would oversee the improvements to the river aire ( from the river ouse at airmyn via castleford to leeds ) and the river calder ( from castleford to wakefield ) john hadley was engaged as the engineer immediately , and by 1704 the original work was completed , including 12 locks on the aire between haddesley and leeds and 4 on the calder the early trade consisted mainly of woollen goods from leeds , wakefield , halifax and bradford , with wool and corn from lincolnshire and east anglia travelling in the opposite direction in 1744 , the undertakers bought some land at airmyn , and developed warehousing and wharfage there , as a more convenient point than rawcliffe , where the water was shallower all locks were replaced , and the total cost was over £60,000 , of which around £20,000 was for the selby canal selby was the upper limit for seagoing ships at the time , and became a major transhipment port for the smaller boats using the canal canal boats were limited to about 60 tons , whereas ships of up to 200 tons could reach selby in 1817 , there was a proposal for an aire and don canal , to connect knottingley to the dutch river at newbridge , with a branch to doncaster , and another for a went and wakefield canal , to connect cold hiendley on the barnsley canal to newbridge on the don construction at goole started on 28 september 1822 , and the company eventually built much of the new town as well as the docks a barge lock , and a ship lock , , capable of taking vessels up to 400 tons , connected the extensive docks to the ouse the new section was long , with locks at ferrybridge , whitley , pollington and goole faced with yet another outside scheme which would bypass the navigation from wakefield to ferrybridge , the company looked at improvements which would give of water all the way to both leeds and wakefield it included a clause to ensure that the selby canal was maintained with a depth of water of , and made provision for extensions to goole docks after the first world war , another programme of improvements to the locks was carried out , extending the locks to , which enabled trains of 19 compartments to operate regularly in 1905 , the new junction canal connected the aire and calder to the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation near stainforth the failure resulted in some of material , including the banks of the river and the canal , slipping into the workings , which then flooded to a depth of , creating a lake which covered between wakefield and leeds , via castleford , the navigation is part of a circular cruising route or '' ring '' , formed by the leeds & liverpool and the huddersfield or rochdale canals
