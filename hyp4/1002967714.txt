ibm 701 competed with remington rand 's univac 1103 in the scientific computation market , which had been developed for the nsa , so it was held secret until permission to market it was obtained in 1951 based on the trials , the two machines had comparable computational speed , with a slight advantage for ibm 's machine , but the univac was favored unanimously for its significantly faster input-output equipment palmer , ibm 's 360 and early 370 systems , mit press , 1991 , pp 23-34 at the lawrence livermore national laboratory , an ibm 701 meant that scientists could run nuclear explosives computations faster nineteen ibm 701 systems were installed the first 701 was delivered to ibm 's world headquarters in new york this misquote is from the 1953 ibm annual stockholders ' meeting was describing the market acceptance of the ibm 701 computer on january 7 , 1954 , the team developed an experimental software program that allowed the ibm 701 computer to translate from russian to english the lawrence livermore national laboratory developed a language compilation and runtime system called the kompiler for their ibm 701 speedcode was the first high-level programming language created for an ibm computer the language was developed by john backus in 1953 for the ibm 701 to support computation with floating point the fortran compiler also developed by backus was not released by ibm until the ibm 704 the williams tube memory required periodic refreshing , mandating the insertion of memory refresh into the 701 's timing ibm 700/7000 series list of ibm products list of vacuum tube computers share ( computing ) strela computer , comparable soviet design amdahl discusses his role in the design of several computers for ibm including the ibm 701 , the ibm 704 and the stretch
