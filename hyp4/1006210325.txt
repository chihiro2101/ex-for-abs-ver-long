it is thought that the proper name ti'amat , which is the construct or vocative form , was dropped in secondary translations of the original texts because some akkadian copyists of enûma elish substituted the ordinary word tāmtu ( '' sea '' ) for tiamat , the two names having become essentially the same due to association the babylonian epic enuma elish is named for its incipit : '' when above '' the heavens did not yet exist nor the earth below , apsu the subterranean ocean was there , '' the first , the begetter '' , and tiamat , the overground sea , '' she who bore them all '' ; they were '' mixing their waters '' it is thought that female deities are older than male ones in mesopotamia and tiamat may have begun as part of the cult of nammu , a female principle of a watery creative force , with equally strong connections to the underworld , which predates the appearance of ea-enki harriet crawford finds this '' mixing of the waters '' to be a natural feature of the middle persian gulf , where fresh waters from the arabian aquifer mix and mingle with the salt waters of the sea tiamat is usually described as a sea serpent or dragon , although assyriologist alexander heidel disagreed with this identification and argued that '' dragon form can not be imputed to tiamat with certainty '' other scholars have disregarded heidel 's argument : joseph fontenrose in particular found it '' not convincing '' and concluded that '' there is reason to believe that tiamat was sometimes , not necessarily always , conceived as a dragoness '' the enûma elish states that tiamat gave birth to dragons and serpents among a more general list of monsters including scorpion men and mermaid , but does not identify her form as that of a dragon ; however , other sources containing the same myth do refer to her as such the depiction of tiamat ( dungeons & dragons ) was popularized in the 1970s as a fixture of the dungeons & dragons roleplaying game inspired by earlier sources associating tiamat with later mythological characters such as lotan ( leviathan ) lahmu and lahamu , in turn , were the parents of the 'ends ' of the heavens ( anshar , from an-šar heaven-totality/end ) and the earth ( kishar ) ; anshar and kishar were considered to meet at the horizon , becoming , thereby , the parents of anu ( heaven ) and ki ( earth ) tiamat was the '' shining '' personification of the sea who roared and smote in the chaos of original creation the tiamat myth is one of the earliest recorded versions of the chaoskampf , the battle between a culture hero and a chthonic or aquatic monster , serpent or dragon martkheel according to some analyses there are two parts to the tiamat myth , the first in which tiamat is creator goddess , through a '' sacred marriage '' between different waters , peacefully creating the cosmos through successive generations in bruce coville 's jeremy thatcher , dragon hatcher ( from the magic shop series ) , a boy is given a dragon egg from elias 's magic shop and names the dragon tiamat , with whom he develops a mental connection tiamat , in the image of a giant mermaid , appears as a boss in the platform game spelunky 2
