there are several theories about how and when gender identity forms , and studying the subject is difficult because children 's lack of language requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence john money suggested children might have awareness of and attach some significance to gender as early as 18 months to 2 years ; lawrence kohlberg argued that gender identity does not form until age 3 it is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age 3 after age three , core gender identity is extremely difficult to change , j kleeman , the establishment of core gender identity in normal girls '' and attempts to reassign it can result in gender dysphoria coleman , developmental stages of the coming out process , in journal of homosexuality , 1982 : '' core gender and sex-role identities are well-formed by the age of 3 ( money & ehrhardt , 1972 ) this is believed because attempts to reassign gender identity after age 3 result in further gender dysphoria '' gender identity refinement extends into the fourth to sixth years of age , stein mt , zucker kj , dixon sd barbara newmann breaks it down into four parts : ( 1 ) understanding the concept of gender , ( 2 ) learning gender role standards and stereotypes , ( 3 ) identifying with parents , and ( 4 ) forming gender preference according to un agencies , discussions relating to comprehensive sexuality education raise awareness of topics , such as gender and gender identity although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood , many factors have been suggested as influencing its development biological factors that influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels susan golombok , robyn fivush , gender development ( 1994 , , p 44 : '' when assigned and raised as boys , these genetic girls adopt a male gender identity and role , showing that a y chromosome is not necessary for gender development to proceed in a male direction '' social factors which may influence gender identity include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family , authority figures , mass media , and other influential people in a child 's life when children are raised by individuals who adhere to stringent gender roles , they are more likely to behave in the same way , matching their gender identity with the corresponding stereotypical gender patterns john money was instrumental in the early research of gender identity , though he used the term gender role in money 's opinion , if the parent confidently raised their child as the opposite sex , the child would believe that they were born that sex and act accordingly a well-known example in the nature-versus-nurture debate is the case of david reimer , otherwise known as '' john/joan '' after he tried to commit suicide at age 13 , he was told that he had been born with male genitalia , which he underwent surgery to reconstruct this response went against money 's hypothesis that biology had nothing to do with gender identity or human sexual orientation the females in the litter also behaved like male rats and would even try to mount other female rats , proving that biology played a major role in animal behavior rowman & littlefield publishers , 2005 , pp.112-113 one study by reiner et al using data from a variety of cases from the 1970s to the early 2000s ( including reiner et al ) , looked at males raised as females due to a variety of developmental disorders ( penile agenesis , cloacal exstrophy or penile ablation ) however , none of the males raised as male switched their gender identity those still living as females still showed marked masculinisation of gender role behaviour and those old enough to reported sexual attraction to women an intersex variation may complicate initial sex assignment and that assignment may not be consistent with the child 's future gender identity several studies have shown that sexually dimorphic brain structures in transsexuals are shifted away from what is associated with their birth sex and towards what is associated with their preferred sex found that the white matter pattern in gynephilic trans men was shifted in the direction of biological males even before the female-to-male transsexuals started taking male hormones social scientists tend to assume that gender identities arise from social factors in 1955 , john money proposed that gender identity was malleable and determined by whether a child was raised as male or female in early childhood , gender dysphoria and disorders of sex development ( 2013 , money 's hypothesis has since been discredited , anne fausto-sterling , sexing the body : gender politics and the construct but scholars have continued to study the effect of social factors on gender identity formation the child thus is born to a gender-specific name , games , and even ambitions once the child 's sex is determined , most children are raised in accordance with it to be a man or a woman , fitting a male or female gender role defined partly by the parents it was concluded that a mother 's behavior was especially influential on a child 's assumptions of the child 's own gender it was concluded , however , that fathers who held the belief of equality between the sexes had children , especially sons , who displayed fewer preconceptions of their opposite gender in some cases , a person 's gender identity is inconsistent with their biological sex characteristics ( genitals and secondary sex characteristics ) , resulting in individuals dressing and/or behaving in a way which is perceived by others as outside cultural gender norms these gender expressions may be described as gender variant , transgender , or genderqueer ( or non-binary ) ( there is an emerging vocabulary for those who defy traditional gender identity ) , and people who have such expressions may experience gender dysphoria ( traditionally called gender identity disorder or gid ) transgender individuals are often greatly affected by language and gender pronouns before , during , and after their transition some people who experience gender dysphoria seek such medical intervention to have their physiological sex match their gender identity ; others retain the genitalia they were born with ( see transsexual for some of the possible reasons ) but adopt a gender role that is consistent with their gender identity 101 : '' gender identity is the individual 's personal and private experience of his/her gender gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness for example , stoller ( 1964 ) used the slightly different term core gender identity psychoanalyst robert stoller generalized many of the findings of the project in his book sex and gender : on the development of masculinity and femininity ( 1968 ) today , sex reassignment surgery is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their external sexual organs will match their gender identity the 1987 revision of the manual , the dsm-iii-r , added a third diagnosis : gender identity disorder of adolescence and adulthood , nontranssexual type human sexuality spectrum identity (
