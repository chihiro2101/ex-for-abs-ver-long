now arguing from a position of strength , the manchester & lincoln union rescinded their plans for most of their lines , and obtained an act of parliament on 7 august 1846 allowing them to construct a line from the midland railway at staveley to the canal at worksop the new company amalgamated with the chesterfield canal , to become the rather unwieldy manchester & lincoln union railway & chesterfield & gainsborough canal , with powers to further amalgamate with the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway the act of parliament stated that although the canal company was to be dissolved , the entire canal was to be retained , its water supplies maintained , and tolls were to be fixed at a just level under the new regime , the canal was put back into good order in 1848 , after many years where regular maintenance had been neglected the railway company started to operate as a carrier on the canal , and to maintain water levels , the reservoirs at chesterfield were enlarged in 1856 the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway was expanding , and an act of parliament was obtained in 1889 , which allowed them to divert parts of the canal to enable a new railway connecting chesterfield , staveley and beighton to be constructed the new route was straighter than the old , and reduced the length of the canal by around the beighton to staveley section of the new railway opened on 1 december 1891 , and reached chesterfield on 4 june 1892 the original route of the canal at hague lane was largely destroyed by the construction of the railway and renishaw central station , but further north , the section around chapel wheel forge and dam is still clearly visible , and reinstatement of it as part of a restored canal was considered but rejected on practical grounds close to bluebank lock , the railway , known as the great central railway chesterfield loop , turned to the east and passed to the south of staveley iron works to reach staveley town station prior to construction of this section , the canal looped to the north around the iron works , passing through cinderhill lock before turning south-eastwards some 40 boats were still working on the canal , although a short section between staveley and chesterfield had become unnavigable by 1961 , the canal had been formally closed , all requests to use it for leisure purposes were refused , and there were proposals for official abandonment of its entire length clarke formed the retford and worksop ( chesterfield canal ) boat club soon afterwards , and it became a limited company in 1966 , to cope with the growing membership unofficial work parties were organised , to clear locks and cut back vegetation and weed ; they were unofficial because the british transport commission would not allow volunteers to work on their property such activity became slightly more collaborative when the canal became the responsibility of the british waterways board government policy changed following the publication of a white paper entitled british waterways : recreation and amenity in september 1967 , and the canal was classified as a cruiseway between the trent and morse lock , worksop under the transport act 1968 , meaning that it would be maintained to a navigable standard for leisure use by 1968 , restoration efforts were sufficiently organised that the chesterfield canal was mentioned in the may edition of the bulletin , produced for members of the inland waterways association ( iwa ) by the forerunners of the waterway recovery group the chesterfield canal trust was formed in september 1976 , determined to restore the canal beyond worksop , and in 1977 they organised a boat rally at worksop to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the canal , in conjunction with the worksop and retford boat club the duke of devonshire opened the festivities , and the chesterfield canal society was formally launched , with a view to attracting support from anyone interested in the canal , rather than just from boaters just before ryton aqueduct , a new shallow lock named boundary lock ( 41a ) had been required , due to widespread subsidence affecting the ground levels , and at shireoaks , the former colliery loading basin had been turned into a marina the last few miles of the canal , from chesterfield to staveley , were in reasonable condition , although the towpath was overgrown and difficult to access , while much of the route was under threat from opencast coal mining and a planned bypass , which had first been proposed in 1927 regular workparties began the process of restoration in 1988 , organised by the chesterfield canal society , and supplemented by volunteers from the waterway recovery group periodically a breach in the canal in march 2007 , caused by the collapse of a culvert carrying the tinkersick brook under the canal , forced temporary closure of all but the top pound above tapton lock for about six weeks near the site of the former renishaw iron foundry , which closed in 1992 and was subsequently redeveloped for housing , a length of canal was reexcavated in 2007–08 the work was aided by a road-building scheme for a new staveley bypass , which enabled two bridges to be raised and a third to be built , all with sufficient clearance for navigation it will not be possible to reopen the norwood tunnel , as several sections have collapsed , the national coal board filled in some sections to stabilise the land above it , and when the m1 motorway was built , the tunnel below it was injection grouted , to ensure there would not be a subsequent collapse what are often called '' traditional '' working narrowboats were the product of the main canal system – but the craft that plied the 46 miles between chesterfield , retford , and the river trent were very different this would provide a way to reach the chesterfield canal without negotiating the tidal river trent , and would create a new cruising ring , taking in the rother link , river don navigation , stainforth and keadby canal , river trent , and chesterfield canal list of waterway societies in the united kingdom list of canal tunnels in the united kingdom list of canal locks in the united kingdom adelphi canal derby canal derby and sandiacre canal trust chesterfield canal trust
