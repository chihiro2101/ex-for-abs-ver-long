the genus lynx is now accepted , and the bobcat is listed as lynx rufus in modern taxonomic sources the genus lynx shares a clade with the genetic lineages puma , prionailurus and felis dated to ; lynx diverged approximately the first wave moved into the southern portion of north america , which was soon cut off from the north by glaciers a second population arrived from asia and settled in the north , developing into the modern canada lynx 13 bobcat subspecies have been historically recognized based on morphological characteristics : l rufus ( schreber ) – eastern and midwestern united states l gigas ( bangs ) – northern new york to nova scotia and new brunswick l floridanus ( rafinesque ) – southeastern united states and inland to the mississippi valley , up to southwestern missouri and southern illinois l superiorensis ( peterson & downing ) – western great lakes area , including upper michigan , wisconsin , southern ontario , and most of minnesota l baileyi ( merriam ) – southwestern united states and northwestern mexico l californicus ( mearns ) – california west of the sierra nevada l fasciatus ( rafinesque ) – oregon , washington west of the cascade range , northwestern california , and southwestern british columbia l the bobcat resembles other species of the midsize genus lynx , but is on average the smallest of the four generally , an off-white color is seen on the lips , chin , and underparts a few melanism bobcats have been sighted and captured in florida , usa and new brunswick , canada the face appears wide due to ruffs of extended hair beneath the ears the pupils are round , black circles and will widen during nocturnal activity to maximize light reception bobcat swims across lake lanier adult males can range in weight from , with an average of ; females at , with an average of dk adult ( 2005 ) , the largest bobcat accurately measured on record weighed , although unverified reports have them reaching union leader the largest-bodied bobcats are from eastern canada and northern new england of the subspecies l the cat is larger in its northern range and in open habitats a morphological size comparison study in the eastern united states found a divergence in the location of the largest male and female specimens , suggesting differing natural selection for the sexes this behavior may vary seasonally , as bobcats become more diurnal during fall and winter in response to the activity of their prey , which are more active during the day in colder weather the home range is marked with feces , urine scent , and by clawing prominent trees in the area '' patterns in bobcat ( lynx rufus ) scent marking and communication behaviors the sizes of bobcats ' home ranges vary significantly ; a world conservation union ( iucn ) summary of research suggests ranges from dispersal from the birth range is most pronounced with males one study found a large variation in male range sizes , from in summer up to in winter other research in various american states has shown little or no seasonal variation like most felines , the bobcat is largely solitary , but ranges often overlap given their smaller range sizes , two or more females may reside within a male 's home range in line with widely differing estimates of home range size , population density figures are divergent , from one to 38 bobcats per in one survey the average is estimated at one bobcat per a link has been observed between population density and sex ratio the bobcat hunts by stalking its prey and then ambushing with a short chase or pounce when these prey species exist together , as in new england , they are the primary food sources of the bobcat birds up to the size of an adult trumpeter swan are also taken in ambushes , along with their fledglings and eggs while larger species , such as cattle , and horses , are not known to be attacked , bobcats do present a threat to smaller ruminants , such as pigs , sheep and goats the bobcat prey base overlaps with that of other midsized predators of a similar ecological niche the oldest wild bobcat on record was 16 years old , and the oldest captive bobcat lived to be 32 bobcats generally begin mating by their second summer , though females may start as early as their first year during courtship , the otherwise silent bobcat may let out loud screams , hisses , or other sounds research in texas has suggested establishing a home range is necessary for breeding ; studied animals with no set range had no identified offspring bobcats remain reproductively active throughout their lives american alligators ( alligator mississippensis ) have been filmed opportunistically preying on adult bobcats in the southeast united states in addition , bobcat sightings have been confirmed in northern indiana , and one was killed near albion , michigan in 2008 a study in coastal southern california has shown bobcat populations are affected by urbanization , creation of roads , and other developments stories featuring the bobcat , in many variations , are found in some indigenous cultures of north america , with parallels in south america
