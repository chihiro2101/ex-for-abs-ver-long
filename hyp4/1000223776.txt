he was the son of sir thomas fludd , a high-ranking governmental official ( queen elizabeth i 's treasurer for war in europe ) , and member of parliament he entered st john 's college , oxford as a commoner in 1591 , graduating with a b.a st john ’ s college , oxford was one of the few in england with any provision for fellowship ( medicine ) ; william huffman suggests that the presence of a medical fellow at st john 's college , oxford influenced fludd 's interest in studying medicine during fludd ’ s time at st john ’ s college , the medical fellow in residence was matthew gwinne ; gwinne had previously produced a tract indicating that , while he practiced galen , he was also familiar with the main paracelsus medical work fludd may have encountered gwinne , or his writing , during his time at oxford , providing an additional influence for his later medical philosophy and practice furthermore , he indicated that he travelled throughout spain , italy and germany following his time in france the main requirements to obtain this , at the time , included demonstrating that he ( the supplicant ) had read and understood the required medical texts—primarily those by galen and hippocrates fludd defended three theses following these texts , and on 14 may 1605 , fludd made his supplication after graduating from christ church , fludd moved to london , settling in fenchurch street , and making repeated attempts to enter the college of physicians he became such an established figure within the college that he was included in seventeenth-century critiques of the college , including those by nicholas culpepper and peter coles fludd was one of the first to support in print the theory of the circulation of the blood of the college 's william harvey to what extent fludd may have actually influenced harvey is still debated , in the context that harvey 's discovery is hard to date precisely debus , robert fludd and the circulation of the blood , j hist med allied sci ( 1961 ) xvi ( 4 ) : 374-393 his view of these mystical authorities was inclined towards the great mathematicians , and he believed , like pythagoras and his followers , that numbers contained access to great hidden secrets certainty in religion could be discovered only through serious study of numbers and ratios this view later brought fludd into conflict with johannes kepler moreover , the fluddean tripartite theory concluded that paracelsus ' own conception of the three primary principles—sulphur , salt and mercury—eventually derived from chaos and light interacting to create variations of the waters , or spirit fludd was heavily reliant on scripture ; in the bible , the number three represented the principium formarum , or the original form this allowed man and earth to approach the infinity of god , and created a universality in sympathy and composition between all things fludd 's application of his mystically inclined tripartite theory to his philosophies of medicine and science was best illustrated through his conception of the macrocosm and microcosm relationship fludd concluded , from a reading of psalm 19:4— '' in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun '' —that the spirit of the lord was contained literally within the sun , placing it central to fludd ’ s model of the macrocosm this was an application of the sympathies and parallels provided to all of god ’ s creation by fludd ’ s tripartite theory of matter the blood was central to fludd 's conception of the relationship between the microcosm and macrocosm ; the blood and the spirit it circulated interacted directly with the spirit conveyed to the macrocosm fludd extended this interaction to his conception of disease : the movement of spirit between the macrocosm and microcosm could be corrupted and invade the microcosm as disease in the third book fludd contends that those filled with the spirit of christ may rise before his second coming the theological and philosophical claims circulating under this name appear , to these outsiders , to have been more an intellectual fashion that swept europe at the time of the counter reformation between 1607 and 1616 , two anonymous rosicrucian manifestos were published by some anonymous person or group , first in germany and later throughout europe the first manifesto was influenced by the work of the respected hermetic philosopher heinrich khunrath , of hamburg , author of the amphitheatrum sapientiae aeternae ( 1609 ) who himself had borrowed generously from the work of john dee in it fludd argued from a platonist point of view ; and he claims that the hermetic or '' chemical '' approach is deeper than the mathematical fludd also wrote against the tillage of light ( 1623 ) of patrick scot ; scot like mersenne found the large claims of hermetic alchemy to be objectionable walker , reviewing two books on fludd in the sixteenth century journal ( by joscelyn godwin , and william huffman ) , writes that '' fludd relied on the bible , the cabbala , and the traditions of alchemy and astrology tita french baumlin , '' robert fludd , '' the dictionary of literary biography , volume 281 : british rhetoricians and logicians , 1500–1660 , second series , detroit : gale , 2003 , pp guariento , luca ( 2016 ) life , friends , and associations of robert fludd : a revised account robert fludd biography at levity fludd 's magnum opus , 'utriusque cosmi maioris salicet et minoris metaphysica
