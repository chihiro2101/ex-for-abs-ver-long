it would appear that some of the earliest empirical explorations of mindset originated in the early 1900s ( gollwitzer 1990 , 2012 ) the attention to mindset within the study of cognitive psychology has continued relatively unabated in addition to the field of cognitive psychology , the use of mindset is evident within the social sciences and several other fields ( e.g a characteristic of this area of study , in all its various manifestations , is the fragment use of mindset throughout the academy ( e.g a well-known example is the '' cold war mindset '' prevalent in both the u.s although most consider that this mindset usefully served to prevent an attack by either country , the assumptions underlying deterrence theory have made assessments of the efficacy of the cold war mindset a matter of some controversy most theorists consider that the key responsibility of an embedded power group is to challenge the assumptions that comprise the group 's own mindset according to these commentators , power groups that fail to review or revise their mindsets with sufficient regularity can not hold power indefinitely , as a single mindset is unlikely to possess the flexibility and adaptability needed to address all future events modern military theory attempts to challenge entrenched mindsets in dealing with asymmetric warfare , terrorism , and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction even amongst scholars within the same disciple studying the same mindset , substantial variations exist ( french , 2016 ) mindset theory , as based on the cultural values defined by sagiv and schwarts , explains the nature , functions , and variables that make up the characteristics of personality the mindscape theory and cultural values outlined by sagive and schwarts combine to make a more comprehensive whole of mindset agency theory according to carol dweck , individuals can be placed on a continuum according to their implicit views of '' where ability comes from '' people with a '' fixed mindset '' believe that abilities are mostly innate and interpret failure as the lack of necessary basic abilities , while those with a '' growth mindset '' believe that they can acquire any given ability provided they invest effort or study according to dweck , individuals with a '' growth '' mindset are more likely to continue working hard despite setbacks in a 2012 interview , dweck defined both fixed and growth mindsets : an example of a person with a growth mindset is an employee who , when posed with an extraordinarily challenging assignment , takes the project as a growing opportunity instead of one that will defeat them according to dweck ( 2010 ) , '' praising students for the process they have engaged in—the effort they applied , the strategies they used , the choices they made , the persistence they displayed , and so on—yields more long-term benefits than telling them they are 'smart ' when they succeed '' as such , it is important for educators to carefully craft and design meaningful learning activities for their students to engage in the classroom a second strategy to promote a growth-mindset culture in the classroom is to explicitly teach lessons related to what it means to adopt a growth mindset possible activities include establishing personal goals , writing letters , or having students share with one another something they used to be poor at and now are very good at in a recent study by hussein ( 2018 ) , the effects of reflective journal writing on students ' growth mindset was examined it was found that the use of journaling could positively affect a student 's learning process by improving their conceptual knowledge , promoting growth mindset , and enhancing understanding of their thoughts through writing the way educators evaluate their students ' work and communicate their progress can also contribute to the establishment of a growth mindset culture in the classroom more specifically , dweck ( 2010 ) identifies the word '' yet '' as a valuable tool to assess students learning overall , it is clear to see that a classroom that includes challenging learning tasks , praising of the process , and explicit growth mindset teaching and assessment , is a classroom where students will have the tools needed to become lifelong learners these studies all demonstrate how framing and discussing students ' work and effort play a considerable role in the type of mindset students develop and students ' conceptions of their own ability while a great deal of research in the education field has focused on a students ability to adopt a growth mindset , less attention and focus has been given to teacher mindsets and the role they play in influencing their students secondly , it was found that many teachers tended to oversimplify the concepts of a growth and fixed mindset into positive and negative traits this suggests the need for more teacher training and support in order for teachers to be able to successfully implement growth mindset initiatives in their classrooms a study conducted by seaton ( 2018 ) , looked specifically at the impact of teacher training aimed at influencing their mindsets and the effect on their resulting practice this study reinforces the bond between a teacher 's own beliefs and how they can strongly influence the mindset of his/her students ; therefore , further highlighting the need for proper teacher training in order for mindset initiatives within schools to be fully successful these studies further illustrate how educators can use intervention strategies , targeting a growth mindset , by allowing students to see that their behaviour can be changed with effort one of the defining characteristics of the study of global mindset is the variety in which scholars conceptualize and operationalize the construct ; and yet ; scholars typically agree that global mindset and its development increases global effectiveness for both individuals and organizations ( french & chang , 2016 ) conceptual re-imagining of global '' mindset '' : knowledge as prime in the development of global leaders
