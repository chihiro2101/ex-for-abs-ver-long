bohm was born in wilkes-barre , pennsylvania , to a hungarian jewish immigrant father , samuel bohm , - by the numbers – david bohm and a lithuanian jewish mother he then transferred to the theoretical physics group directed by robert oppenheimer at the university of california , berkeley radiation laboratory , where he obtained his doctorate bohm lived in the same neighborhood as some of oppenheimer 's other graduate students ( giovanni rossi lomanitz , joseph weinberg , and max friedman ) and with them became increasingly involved in radical politics during world war ii , the manhattan project mobilized much of berkeley 's physics research in the effort to produce the first atomic bomb bohm later performed theoretical calculations for the calutrons at the y-12 facility in oak ridge , tennessee , which was used for the isotope separation electromagnetic for the bomb dropped on hiroshima in 1945 he also worked closely with albert einstein at the nearby institute for advanced study in may 1949 , the house un-american activities committee called upon bohm to testify because of his previous ties to unionism and suspected communists bohm invoked his fifth amendment right to refuse to testify , and he refused to give evidence against his colleagues in 1950 , bohm was arrested for refusing to answer the committee 's questions after his acquittal , bohm 's colleagues sought to have him reinstated at princeton , but princeton president harold w : science and exile : david bohm , the cold war , and a new interpretation of quantum mechanics , hsps , vol bohm then left for brazil to assume a professorship of physics at the university of são paulo , at jayme tiomno 's invitation and on the recommendation of both einstein and oppenheimer during his early period , bohm made a number of significant contributions to physics , particularly quantum mechanics and relativity theory his first book , quantum theory , published in 1951 , was well received by einstein , among others hiley : zeno paradox for bohmian trajectories : the unfolding of the metatron , 3 january 2011 ( pdf & nbsp ; – retrieved 16 february 2012 ) he began to develop his own interpretation ( the de broglie–bohm theory , also called the pilot wave theory ) , the predictions of which agreed perfectly with the non-deterministic quantum theory he initially called his approach a hidden variable theory , but he later called it ontological theory , reflecting his view that a stochastic process underlying the phenomena described by his theory might one day be found bohm and his colleague basil hiley later stated that they had found their own choice of terms of an '' interpretation in terms of hidden variables '' to be too restrictive , especially since their variables , position , and momentum '' are not actually hidden '' david bohm , basil hiley : the undivided universe : an ontological interpretation of quantum theory , edition published in the taylor & francis e-library 2009 ( first edition routledge , 1993 ) , , p : science and exile : david bohm , the cold war , and a new interpretation of quantum mechanics , hsps , vol & nbsp ; 36 , part & nbsp ; 1 , pp & nbsp ; 1–34 , issn 0890-9997 , 2005 at the university of são paulo , bohm worked on the causal theory that became the subject of his publications in 1952 from 1951 to 1953 , bohm and david pines published the articles in which they introduced the random phase approximation and proposed the plasmon in 1955 bohm relocated to israel , where he spent two years working at the technion , at haifa in 1957 , bohm and his student yakir aharonov published a new version of the epr paradox , reformulating the original argument in terms of spin in 1959 , bohm and aharonov discovered the aharonov–bohm effect , showing how a magnetic field could affect a region of space in which the field had been shielded , but its vector potential did not vanish there in 1961 , bohm was made professor of theoretical physics at the university of london 's birkbeck college , becoming emeritus in 1987 at birkbeck college , much of the work of bohm and basil hiley expanded on the notion of implicate , explicate , and generative orders proposed by bohm david bohm , basil j stuart : on a new mode of description in physics , international journal of theoretical physics , vol the mature expression of bohm 's views in the psychological field was presented in a seminar conducted in 1990 at the oak grove school , founded by krishnamurti in ojai , california bohm suggested that if the '' dialogue groups '' were experienced on a sufficiently-wide scale , they could help overcome the isolation and fragmentation that bohm observed in society bohm 's wife consulted psychiatrist david shainberg , bohm 's longtime friend and collaborator , who agreed that electroconvulsive treatments were probably his only option infinite potential : the life and times of david bohm ( film ) www.infinitepotential.com , accessed 28 december 2020 the essential david bohm
