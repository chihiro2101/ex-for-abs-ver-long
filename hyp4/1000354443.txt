there is no provision for the role of political parties in the united states constitution , since the founding fathers did not originally intend for american politics to be partisan 10 , alexander hamilton and james madison , respectively , wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic political factions thus in the first two presidential elections , the electoral college handled the nominations and elections in 1789 and 1792 that selected george washington richard hofstadter , the idea of a party system : the rise of legitimate opposition in the united states , 1780–1840 ( 1970 ) gordon s wood , empire of liberty : a history of the early republic , 1789–1815 ( oxford history of the united states ) starting with the 1796 election , congressional party or a state legislature party caucus selected the party 's presidential candidates delegates to the national convention were usually selected at state conventions whose own delegates were chosen by district conventions sometimes they were dominated by intrigue between political bosses who controlled delegates ; the national convention was far from democratic or transparent progressive era reformers looked to the primary election as a way to measure popular opinion of candidates , as opposed to the opinion of the bosses in 1910 , oregon became the first state to establish a presidential preference primary , which requires delegates to the national convention to support the winner of the primary at the convention by 1920 there were 20 states with primaries , but some went back , and from 1936 to 1968 , 12 states used them roosevelt proved the most popular candidate , but as most primaries were non-binding '' preference '' shows and held in only fourteen of the-then forty-eight states , the republican nomination went to taft , who controlled the convention seeking to boost voter turnout , new hampshire simplified its ballot access laws in 1949 a large number of states , faced with the need to conform to more detailed rules for the selection of national delegates , chose a presidential primary as an easier way to come into compliance with the new national democratic party rules the result was that many more future delegates would be selected by a state presidential primary with the broadened use of the primary system , states have tried to increase their influence in the nomination process one tactic has been to create geographic blocs to encourage candidates to spend time in a region vermont and massachusetts attempted to stage a joint new england primary on the first tuesday of march , but new hampshire refused to participate so it could retain its traditional place as the first primary the first regional primary was the southern super tuesday of march 8 , 1988 , in which nine states united in the idea that a candidate would reflect regional interests the 1988 presidential election in the south : continuity amidst change in southern party politics ( 1991 ) pp 3–20 it failed as all but two of the eight major candidates won at least one primary on that day a major reason states try to increase their influence , and vie for earlier primaries , is that in recent years the races have usually been decided before the primary season has ended in june for example , john mccain officially clinched the 2008 republican presidential nomination in march , while during that same month barack obama held a substantial lead in pledged delegates in the democratic party primaries in 2012 , both the republicans and the democrats moved their florida primary to january 31 , which was an earlier date than past election cycles in response , other states also changed their primary election dates for 2012 , in order to claim a greater influence , creating a cascade of changes in other states this followed what happened in 2008 when nevada moved its caucuses to january , causing other states to also move their primaries to earlier dates both parties then enacted stricter timing rules for 2016 : primaries and caucuses can not start until february 1 ; and only iowa , new hampshire , south carolina and nevada are entitled to february contests the primary and caucus system is the only method in which voters in puerto rico , guam , and other u.s during the 1976 republican party primaries , then-former california governor reagan carried 23 states while running against incumbent president gerald ford ; ford then went on to lose the presidential election to jimmy carter bush during the 1992 republican primaries , but only received a handful of delegates ; bush too subsequently went on to lose in the general election to clinton both major political parties of the u.s.—the democratic party and the republican party—officially nominate their candidate for president at their respective national conventions the results of the presidential primaries and caucuses bind many of these delegates , known as pledged delegates , to vote for a particular candidate these are each states ' two national committeepersons and the state chairperson in democratic primaries through 2016 , about 85 % of delegates to the democratic national convention are '' pledged delegates '' who are apportioned to candidates according to the results of primaries and caucuses the party voted in favor of superdelegate reform , such that in future presidential elections most superdelegates will be bound to their state primary results franchise in a primary or caucus is governed by rules established by the state party , although the states may impose other regulations nearly all states have a binding primary or caucus , in which the results of the election depending on state law or party rules legally bind some or all of the delegates to vote for a particular candidate at the national convention , for a certain number of ballots or until the candidate releases the delegates in many of those states that have proportional vote primaries , a candidate must meet a certain threshold in the popular vote to be given delegates some states may use a binding walking subcaucus system , where voters may instead be choosing pledged delegates to a local , county or state party convention , which then in turn selects pledged delegates to the national convention in many states , only voters registered with a party may vote in that party 's primary , known as a closed primary a few states once staged a blanket primary , in which voters could vote for one candidate in multiple primaries , but the practice was struck down by the u.s under the current democratic party selection rules , adopted in 2006 , pledged delegates are selected under proportional representation , which requires a candidate have a minimum of 15 % of a state 's popular vote to receive delegates each state publishes a delegate selection plan that notes the mechanics of calculating the number of delegates per congressional district , and how votes are transferred from local conventions to the state and national convention since the 2012 democratic primaries , the number of pledged delegates allocated to each of the 50 u.s is based on two main factors : ( 1 ) the proportion of votes each state gave to the democratic candidate in the last three presidential elections , and ( 2 ) the number of electoral votes each state has in the united states electoral college states and territories who schedule their primary or caucus later in the primary season may also get additional bonus delegates the republican party 's rules since 2008 leave more discretion to the states in choosing a method of allocating pledged delegates states is 10 at-large delegates , plus three district delegates for each congressional district each party 's bylaws also specify which current and former elected officeholders and party leaders qualify as unpledged delegates campaigning for president often begins almost a year before the new hampshire primary , almost two years before the presidential election the primary election itself is administered by local governments according to state law in some cases , state law determines how delegates will be awarded and who may participate in the primary ; where it does not , party rules prevail should any other state move its primary too close to new hampshire 's , or before , the new hampshire secretary of state is required to reschedule the primary accordingly in the 2012 republican primaries , newt gingrich initially finished poorly in the early states , but then scored an upset victory in south carolina over frontrunner mitt romney in addition , his plan would allow for a few small population states , such as iowa and new hampshire , to hold their primaries in advance of the first region it would still allow states to determine the timing of their own primaries , while giving them some incentive to hold primaries later for example , during the 2012 republican primary , florida and several other states still moved their primaries to earlier dates despite being penalized delegates
