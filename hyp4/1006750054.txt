karl drais included a pivoting brake shoe that could be pressed against the rear iron tyre of his 1817 laufmaschine this was continued on the earliest bicycles with pedals , such as the boneshaker , which were fitted with a spoon brake to press onto the rear wheel the next development of the bicycle , the penny-farthings , were similarly braked with a spoon brake or by back pedalling however , as the rear wheel became smaller and smaller , with more of the rider 's weight over the front wheel , braking on the rear wheel became less effective some penny-farthing riders used only back pedalling and got off and walked down steep hills , but most also used a brake an alternative to the spoon brake for penny-farthings was the caliper brake patented by browett and harrison in 1887 this early version of caliper braking used a rubber block to contact the outside of the penny-farthing 's small rear tyre the 1870s and 1880s saw the development of the safety bicycle which roughly resembles bicycles today , with two wheels of equal size , initially with solid rubber tyres these were typically equipped with a front spoon brake and no rear brake mechanism , but like penny-farthings they used fixed gears , allowing rear wheel braking by resisting the motion of the pedals the relative fragility of the wooden rims used on most bicycles still precluded the use of rim brakes duck of duck 's cyclery in oakland , california was granted a patent for his duck roller brake ( u.s in the united states , the coaster brake was the most commonly fitted brake throughout the first half of the 20th century , often comprising the only braking system on the bicycle the spoon brake , or plunger brake was probably the first type of bicycle brake and precedes the pneumatic tyre in developing world , a foot-operated form of the spoon brake sometimes is retrofitted to old rod brake roadsters it consists of a spring-loaded flap attached to the back of the fork crown this is depressed against the front tyre by the rider 's foot perhaps more so than any other form of bicycle brake , the spoon brake is sensitive to road conditions and increases tyre wear dramatically though made obsolete by the introduction of the duck brake , coaster brake , and rod brake , spoon brakes continued to be used in the west supplementally on adult bicycles until the 1930s , and on children 's bicycles until the 1950s invented in 1897 , the duck brake or duck roller brake used a rod operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin friction rollers ( usually made of wood or rubber ) against the front tyre used in combination with a rear coaster brake , a cyclist of the day could stop much more quickly and with better modulation of braking effort than was possible using only a spoon brake or rear coaster brake 198-233 : the spoon brake was fairly ineffective , while the coaster brake did not operate on the front tyre , the most effective position on a two-wheel vehicle during a hard stop parliamentary debates : senate and house of representatives , tariff preferences , volume 34 ( 19 september 1906 ) , p bill was granted a patent for an improved version of the duck roller brake ( patent 708,114 ) for use on motorized bicycles ( motorcycles ) , united states patent office , letters patent no 708,114 , september 2 , 1902 duck brake company , testimonial of geo wyman , who crossed the united states aboard a motorized bicycle with a duck roller brake praised its efficiency , stating that '' i controlled my motorbike with it on the steepest grades of the rocky mountains '' brake pads can be made of leather , rubber or cork and are often mounted in metal '' shoes '' rim brakes are inexpensive , light , mechanically simple , easy to maintain , and powerful however , they perform relatively poorly when the rims are wet , and will brake unevenly if the rims are even slightly warped the low price and ease of maintenance of rim brakes makes them popular in low- to mid-price commuter bikes , where the disadvantages are alleviated by the unchallenging conditions the light weight of rim brakes also makes them desirable in road racing bicycles as they wear down , their position may need to be adjusted as the material wears away because the motion of most brakes is not perfectly horizontal , the pads may lose their centering as they wear , causing the pads to wear unevenly however , on a heavily laden bike on a long descent , heat energy may be added more quickly than it can dissipate causing heat build-up , which may damage components and cause brake failure brake pads are available with numerous shapes and materials many consist of a replaceable rubber pad held on a mounting , or brake shoe , with a post or bolt on the back to attach to the brake the rubber can be softer for more braking force with less lever effort , or harder for longer life larger pads do not necessarily provide more braking force , but will wear more slowly ( in relation to thickness ) , so can usually be thinner in general , a brake can be fitted with a variety of pads , as long as the mounting is compatible carbon fiber rims may be more sensitive to damage by incorrectly-matched brake pads , and generally must use non-abrasive cork pads the friction force between brake shoe and rim creates a bending moment around the point where the brake bolt emerges from the fork thus the front brake is typically more effective than the rear when the brakes are so mounted the design is still in use , typically on african and asian roadsters such as the sohrab and flying pigeon caliper brakes tend to become less effective as tyres get wider , and so deeper , reducing the brakes ' mechanical advantage when the brake lever is squeezed , the arms move together and the brake pads squeeze the rim if not adjusted properly , low-quality varieties tend to rotate to one side during actuation and tend to stay there , making it difficult to evenly space brake shoes away from the rim these brakes are now used on inexpensive bikes ; before the introduction of dual-pivot caliper brakes they were used on all types of road bikes the centering of side-pull brakes was improved with the mass-market adoption of dual-pivot side-pulls ( an old design re-discovered by shimano in the early 1990s ) thus u-brakes are often interchangeable with , and have the same maintenance issues as , roller cam brakes u-brakes were used on mountain bikes through the early 1990s , particularly under the chainstays , a rear brake mounting location that was then popular unfortunately it is also very prone to clogging by mud , which meant that u-brakes quickly fell out of favour on cross-country bikes this is especially valuable on freestyle bmx bikes where any protruding parts are susceptible to damage and may interfere with the rider 's body or clothing the cantilever brake is a class of brake in which each arm is attached to a separate pivot point on one side of the seat stay or fork in the second-class lever design , the arm pivots below the rim the brake shoe is mounted above the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are drawn together due to a wider possible distance between the mounts and pads , cantilever brakes are often preferred for bicycles that use wide tyres , such as on mountain bikes as the brake shoes of a second-class cantilever brake wears , they ride lower on the rim traditional cantilever brakes are difficult to adapt to bicycle suspensions and protrude somewhat from the frame some high-end v-brakes use a four-pivot parallel motion so the brake pads contact at virtually the same position on the wheel rim regardless of wear and specifically for suspension forks where the housing must terminate at the brake frame , the side-pull '' sabre cam brake '' was developed other reasons include : while all types of brakes will eventually wear out the braking surface , a brake disc is easier and cheaper to replace than a wheel rim or drum front hubs designed for discs often move the left hub 's flange inward to make room for the disc , which causes the wheel to be dished cable-actuated disc brakes were traditionally the only type of disc brake that could be used with the brake levers found on drop handlebars , sheldon brown , quoted at but this is no longer the case it is also common to use a larger diameter rotor on the front wheel and a smaller rotor on the rear wheel since the front wheel does the most braking ( up to 90 % of the total )
