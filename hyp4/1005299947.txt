the chinese concept of the world was largely a division between the civilized world and the barbarian world and there was little concept of the belief that chinese interests were served by a powerful chinese state chinese nationalism as it emerged in the early 20th century was based on the experience of european nationalism , especially as viewed and interpreted by sun yat-sen the key factor in european nationalism was tradition – some of the newly manufactured – of a cultural identity based primarily on language and ethnicity chinese nationalism was rooted in the long historic tradition of china as the center of the world , in which all other states were offshoots and owed some sort of deference china and revolution : the first phase , 1900–1913 ( 1968 ) pp ethnic nationalism was , in any case , unacceptable to the ruling manchu elitethey were foreigners who conquered china and maintained their own language and traditions odd arne westad , restless empire : china and the worlds in 1750 ( 2012 ) pp if accepted , they would be rotated around the country , so the bureaucrats did not identify with the locality on how confucianism was an invented tradition in china see lionel m political scientist suisheng zhao argues that nationalism in china is not monolithic but exists in various forms , including political , liberal , ethnical , and state nationalism over the first half of the twentieth century , chinese nationalism has constituted a crucial part of many political ideologies , including the anti-manchuism during 1911 revolution , the anti-imperialism sentiment of the may fourth movement in 1919 , and the maoist thoughts that guided the communist revolution in 1949 the origin of modern chinese nationalism can be traced back to the intellectual debate on race and nation in late nineteenth century shaped by the global discourse of social darwinism , reformers and intellectuals debated how to build a new chinese national subject based on a proper racial order , particularly the man-han relations after the collapse of the qing regime and the founding of the republic of china in 1911 , concerns of both domestic and international threat made the role of racism decline , while anti-imperialism became the new dominant ideology of chinese nationalism over the 1910s while intellectuals and elites advocated their distinctive thoughts on chinese nationalism , political scientist chalmers johnson has pointed out that most of these ideas had very little to do with china 's majority population -- the chinese peasantry he thus proposes to supplement the chinese communist ideology in the discussion of chinese nationalism , which he labels '' peasant nationalism '' chinese nationalism in the early twentieth century was primarily based on anti-manchurism , an ideology that was prevalent among chinese revolutionaries from late nineteenth century to the turn of the twentieth century liang 's thought was based on the idea of racial competition , a concept originating from social darwinism that believed only superior races would survive whereas the inferior races were bound to extinct liang attributed the decline of china to the manchu ( qing ) rulers , who treated the han as an '' alien race '' and imposed a racial hierarchy between the han and the manchus while ignoring the threat of imperial powers in his writing “ revolutionary army , ” zou rong , an active chinese revolutionary at the turn of the twentieth century , demanded a revolution education for the han people who were suffering from the oppression of the manchu rule wang contended that a state consisting of a single race would be superior to those multiracial ones since the han had asserted its dominant role in chinese nationalism , the manchus had to be either absorbed or eradicated '' after the 1911 revolution , sun yat-sen established the republic of china , the national flag of which contained five colors with each symbolizing a major racial ethnicity of china the rhetorical move , as china historian joseph esherick points out , was based on the practical concerns of both imperial threats from the international environment and conflicts on the chinese frontiers an ideal of '' a morally just universe , '' anti-imperialism made racism appear shameful and thus took over its dominant role in the conceptualization of chinese nationalism in addition to anti-manchurism and anti-imperialism , political scientist chalmers johnson has argued that the rise of power of the ccp through its alliance with the peasantry should also be understood as '' a species of nationalism '' johnson observes that social mobilization , a force that unites people to form a political community together , is the '' primary tool '' for conceptualizing nationalism johnson contends that early nationalism of the kuomintang was quite similar to the late nineteenth-century nationalism in europe , as both referred to the search for their national identities and positions in the modern world by the intelligentsia he argues that nationalism constructed by the intellectuals is not identical to nationalism based on mass mobilization , as the nationalist movements led by the kuomintang , as well as the may fourth movement in 1919 , were not mass movements because their participants were only a small proportion of the society where the peasants were simply absent the wartime alliance of the chinese peasantry and the ccp manifests how the nationalist ideology of the ccp , or the peasant nationalism , reinforced the desire of the chinese to save and build a strong nation during the 1960s and 1970s , chinese nationalism within mainland china became mixed with the rhetoric of marxism , and nationalistic rhetoric become in large part subsumed into internationalist rhetoric on the other hand , chinese nationalism in taiwan was primarily about preserving the ideals and lineage of sun yat-sen , the party he founded , the kuomintang ( kmt ) , and anti-communism while the definition of chinese nationalism differed in the republic of china ( roc ) and the people 's republic of china ( prc ) , both are adamant in claiming chinese territories such as the senkaku islands and the nine-dash line in the south china sea defining the relationship between ethnicity and the chinese identity has been a very complex issue throughout chinese history in the 17th century , with the help of ming chinese rebels , the manchus conquered china proper and set up the qing dynasty the manchus were faced with the issue of maintaining loyalty among the people they ruled while at the same time maintaining a distinctive identity the complexity of the relationship between ethnicity and the chinese identity is best exemplified during the taiping rebellion in which the rebels fought fiercely against the manchus on the ground that they were barbarian foreigners while at the same time others fought just as fiercely on behalf of the manchus on the grounds that they were the preservers of traditional chinese values it was during this time that the concept of han chinese came into existence as a means of describing the majority of chinese ethnicity due to sinicization in early chinese history in 1919 , the may fourth movement grew out of student protests to the treaty of versailles , especially its terms allowing japan to shandong problem surrendered by germany after the siege of tsingtao , and spurned upsurges of chinese nationalism amongst the protests chinese muslims have played an important role in chinese nationalism chinese muslims , known as hui people , are a mixture of the descendants of foreign muslims like arabs and persians , mixed with han chinese who converted to islam chinese muslims are sinophones , speaking chinese and practicing confucianism hu songshan , a muslim imam from ningxia , was a chinese nationalist and preached chinese nationalism and unity of all chinese people , and also against foreign imperialism and other threats to china 's sovereignty he even ordered the chinese flag to be saluted during prayer , and that all imams in ningxia preach chinese nationalism hu songhan also wrote a prayer in arabic and chinese , praying for allah to support the chinese kuomintang government and defeat japan ma fuxiang preached unity of all chinese people , and even non-han chinese people such as tibetans and mongols to stay in china ma fuxiang believed that modern education would help hui chinese build a better society and help china resist foreign imperialism and help build the nation ma fuxiang had served under the chinese muslim general dong fuxiang , and fought against the foreigners during the boxer rebellion general ma hushan 's brother ma zhongying denounced separatism in a speech at id kah mosque and told the uighurs to be loyal to the chinese government at nanjing he advocated pan-han chinese nationalism against the ruling manchu-led
