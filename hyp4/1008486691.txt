in 1860 , joseph swan produced carbon fibers for the first time , for use in light bulbs in 1880 , lewis latimer developed a reliable carbon wire filament for the incandescent light bulb , heated by electricity in 1958 , roger bacon created high-performance carbon fibers at the union carbide parma technical center located outside of cleveland , ohio this process proved to be inefficient , as the resulting fibers contained only about 20 % carbon and had low strength and stiffness properties this had produced a carbon fiber that contained about 55 % carbon 3,294,489 ) for producing a high carbon content ( 99 % ) fiber using rayon as a precursor these carbon fibers had sufficient strength ( modulus of elasticity and tensile strength ) to be used as a reinforcement for composites having high strength to weight properties and for high temperature resistant applications the high potential strength of carbon fiber was realized in 1963 in a process developed by w the carbon-fiber production plant was sold off to form bristol composite materials engineering ltd ( often referred to as bristol composites ) in the late 1960s , the japanese took the lead in manufacturing pan-based carbon fibers during the 1960s , experimental work to find alternative raw materials led to the introduction of carbon fibers made from a petroleum pitch derived from oil processing depending upon the precursor to make the fiber , carbon fiber may be turbostratic or graphitic , or have a hybrid structure with both graphitic and turbostratic parts present in turbostratic carbon fiber the sheets of carbon atoms are haphazardly folded , or crumpled , together turbostratic carbon fibers tend to have high ultimate tensile strength , whereas heat-treated mesophase-pitch-derived carbon fibers have high young 's modulus ( i.e in a comparison between steel and carbon fiber materials for automotive industry , carbon fiber may be 10-12x more expensive non-polymer materials can also be used as the matrix for carbon fibers due to the formation of metal carbides and corrosion considerations , carbon has seen limited success in metal matrix composite applications this thread can then be used to weave a carbon fiber filament fabric or cloth basalt fiber carbon fiber reinforced polymer ceramic matrix composite carbon nanotube esd materials graphene
