the dearne and dove canal was also authorised in 1793 , from swinton to barnsley , and was again under don navigation control , since most of the shareholders were also shareholders in the don a canal from tinsley into sheffield was delayed for years by opposition from the don navigation , but was authorised in 1815 and opened in 1819 they bought out the dearne and dove canal in 1846 , and acquired the sheffield canal from the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway in 1848 , which , as the sheffield and lincolnshire junction railway , a predecessor and constituent company , had bought it in 1846 they then amalgamated with the south yorkshire , doncaster and goole railway in 1850 , to become the south yorkshire railway and river dun company by the 1880s , there was dissatisfaction among the users that the rates for traffic were higher than on the railways , and the canals were failing to modernise , as steam boats were banned , despite them having been in use for 50 years on the neighbouring aire and calder navigation with the manchester ship canal under construction , and other large canals being proposed , a committee was formed to investigate a new canal from sheffield to the sea their report , presented in october 1888 , suggested that the existing locks on the route from sheffield to keadby were inadequate , but that the waterway could be upgraded to take 300- to 500-ton boats by building new locks alongside the old , without disrupting traffic the estimated cost of this work , which included a new canal from tinsley to sheffield , but did not include buying the canals from the railway company , was put at £1 & nbsp ; million the sheffield and south yorkshire canal company limited was formed in november 1888 , with a capital of £30,000 , to promote this new venture and obtain the necessary act of parliament the new company obtained an act of parliament on 26 august 1889 , creating the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation company , which was authorised to raise £1.5 & nbsp ; million and to purchase the four canals either by negotiation , or by compulsory purchase if after nine months negotiations with the railway company had failed to reach an agreement in addition , the dearne and dove canal would be dredged , so that tom pudding , like those on the aire and calder , could be used for the transport of coal meanwhile , negotiations had also taken place with the aire and calder , and an agreement had been reached to connect the two systems together by a canal , so that the improved don could use goole for the export of coal , rather than having to develop keadby the rest could be paid in shares in the new company , which would give the railway places on the board unless the canal company bought all of the shares back this was enshrined in a new act of parliament obtained on 31 july 1893 , but the clause about railway representation meant that the aire and calder declined to purchase any shares , and the company struggled to raise the capital today the system is open to navigation throughout the main line , the stainforth and keadby and new junction canals , and is mostly used for leisure boating
