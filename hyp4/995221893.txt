atmel corporation was founded in 1984 , by george perlegos atmel was an acronym for “ advanced technology for memory and logic ” perlegos had worked in the memory group of intel in the 1970s and had co-founded seeq technology to manufacture eprom memory fundinguniverse.com , '' atmel corporation history '' the first atmel memory products used less power than competitors about.com , '' atmel corporation '' rather than fight the patent claim , atmel redesigned its products to use different intellectual property in addition , atmel then entered the flash memory business that intel had focused on atmel used us 60 million in venture capital for the 1989 purchase of a fabrication facility from honeywell in colorado springs the first atmel flash memory microcontroller was based on the intel 8051 in 1994 , atmel purchased the eerom assets of seeq technology ( lsi corporation acquired the rest of seeq in 1999 ) atmel built a new fab alongside the existing es2 fab atmel formed a design team in trondheim , norway to develop the atmel avr line of risc microcontrollers this team combined technology of former students at the norwegian university of science and technology with atmel 's expertise in flash memory this started in 2005 when atmel sold the mhs fab in nantes france to xbybus '' grading the chain : atmel ceo steven laub '' atmel announced the sale of its north tyneside facility ( fab9 ) on october 8 , 2007 atmel completed the sale of their secure microcontroller solutions smart card business to inside secure '' atmel 's xsense technology will make curved touchscreens possible ( hands-on ) '' atmel moved into internet of things technology in 2012 , atmel had approximately us 1.4 billion in annual revenue , with over 60 % of their revenue from microcontrollers , and net income of us 30 million in addition atmel still makes microcontrollers that use the 8051 architecture , albeit improved to do single-cycle instructions also , atmel offers 2.4 & nbsp ; ghz b/g/n wi-fi chips wilc1000/wilc3000 and winc1500 from its newport media , inc acquisition atmel also makes simple touch controller chips for buttons , sliders , and wheels used on industrial and consumer products atmel 's cryptorf products add hardware encrypted security to rfid applications atmel also has chips specialized for the smart energy and smart metering markets
