usually , an enzyme molecule has only two active sites , and the active sites fit with one specific type of substrate an active site contains a binding site that binds the substrate and orients it for catalysis the orientation of the substrate and the close proximity between it and the active site is so important that in some cases the enzyme can still function properly even though all other parts are mutated and lose function initially , the interaction between the active site and the substrate is non-covalent and transient there are four important types of interaction that hold the substrate in a defined orientation and form an enzyme-substrate complex ( es complex ) : hydrogen bonds , van der waals force , hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions a tighter fit between an active site and the substrate molecule is believed to increase the efficiency of a reaction if the tightness between the active site of dna polymerase and its substrate is increased , the fidelity , which means the correct rate of dna replication will also increase most enzymes have deeply buried active sites , which can be accessed by a substrate via access channels he proposed that the active site and substrate are two stable structures that fit perfectly without any further modification , just like a key fits into a lock if one substrate perfectly binds to its active site , the interactions between them will be strongest , resulting in high catalytic efficiency as time went by , limitations of this model started to appear for example , the competitive enzyme inhibitor methylglucoside can bind tightly to the active site of 4-alpha-glucanotransferase and perfectly fits into it apart from competitive inhibition , this theory can not explain the mechanism of action of non-competitive inhibition either , as they do not bind to the active site but nevertheless influence catalytic activity daniel koshland 's theory of enzyme-substrate binding is that the active site and the binding portion of the substrate are not exactly complementary this model suggests that enzymes exist in a variety of conformations , only some of which are capable of binding to a substrate when a substrate is bound to the protein , the equilibrium in the conformational ensemble shifts towards those able to bind ligands ( as enzymes with bound substrates are removed from the equilibrium between the free conformations ) although the individual force is weak , as the total number of interactions between the active site and substrate is massive the sum of them will be significant these hydrophobic groups usually have long carbon chain and do not react with water molecules once the substrate is bound and oriented to the active site , catalysis can begin the residues of the catalytic site are typically very close to the binding site , and some residues can have dual-roles in both binding and catalysis during enzyme catalytic reaction , the substrate and active site are brought together in a close proximity firstly , when substrates bind within the active site the thermodynamic activity of it significantly increases than in solution next , the active site is designed to reorient the substrate to reduce the activation energy for the reaction to occur the alignment of the substrate , after binding , is locked in a high energy state and can proceed to the next step in addition , this binding is favoured by entropy as the energy cost associated with solution reaction is largely eliminated since solvent can not enter active site in the end , the active site may manipulate the molecular orbital of the substrate into a suitable orientation to reduce activation energy the electrostatic states of substrate and active site must be complementary to each other but if the transition state involves the formation of an ion centre then the side chain will now produce a favourable interaction the former one is mainly affected by the basicity ( the ability to donate electron pairs ) of the species while the later one is in regard to its pk a both groups are also affected by their chemical properties such as polarizability , electronegativity and ionization energy amino acids that can form nucleophile including serine , cysteine , aspartate and glutamine larger ligands generally stay in the active site longer , as do those with more rotatable bonds ( although this may be a side effect of size ) when the solvent is excluded from the active site , less flexible proteins result in longer residence times they can also induce transient conformational changes in the active site so substrates can not fit perfectly with it since they do not compete with substrates for the active site , they can not be overcome by simply increasing the substrate concentration however , irreversible inhibitors form irreversible covalent bonds with the amino acid residues in the active site and never leave
