balancing these competing requirements leads to optimal inventory levels , which is an ongoing process as the business needs shift and react to the wider environment inventory management involves a retailer seeking to acquire and maintain a proper merchandise assortment while ordering , shipping , handling , and related costs are kept in check it also involves systems and processes that identify inventory requirements , set targets , provide replenishment techniques , report actual and projected inventory status and handle all functions related to the tracking and management of material this would include the monitoring of material moved into and out of stockroom locations and the reconciling of the inventory balances it also may include abc analysis , lot tracking , cycle counting support , etc management of the inventories , with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution system , functions to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock holding and handling costs there are five basic reasons for keeping an inventory time – the time lags present in the supply chain , from supplier to user at every stage , requires that you maintain certain amounts of inventory to use in this lead time however , in practice , inventory is to be maintained for consumption during 'variations in lead time ' this can lead to stock accumulation , consider for example how goods consumed only in holidays can lead to accumulation of large stocks on the anticipation of future consumption uncertainty – inventories are maintained as buffers to meet uncertainties in demand , supply and movements of goods appreciation in value – in some situations , some stock gains the required value when it is kept for some time to allow it reach the desired standard for consumption , or for production skus can be any combination of letters and numbers chosen , just as long as the system is consistent and used for all the products in the inventory an sku code may also be referred to as product code , barcode , part number or mpn ( manufacturer 's part number ) such merchandise may not be produced anymore , and the new old stock may represent the only market source of a particular item at the present time inventories not intended for sale to customers or to clients may be held in any premises an organization uses while the reasons for holding stock were covered earlier , most manufacturing organizations usually divide their '' goods for sale '' inventory into : raw materials – materials and components scheduled for use in making a product these are used in process of manufacture and as such these are neither raw material nor finished goods finished goods – goods ready for sale to customers its finished good inventory consists of all the filled and labeled cans of food in its warehouse that it has manufactured and wishes to sell to food distributors ( wholesalers ) , to grocery stores ( retailers ) , and even perhaps to consumers through arrangements like factory stores and outlet centers walsh , journal of construction engineerign and manabement , nov–dec 2014 , p 818 such as encountered in civilian infrastructure construction or oil and gas inventory may not only reflect physical items ( such as materials , parts , partially-finished sub-assemblies ) but also knowledge work-in-process ( such as partially completed engineering designs of components and assemblies to be fabricated ) a '' virtual inventory '' ( also known as a '' bank inventory '' ) enables a group of users to share common parts , especially where their availability at short notice may be critical but they are unlikely to required by more than a few bank members at any one time costs associated with inventory there are several costs associated with inventory : ordering cost setup cost holding cost shortage cost inventory proportionality is the goal of demand-driven inventory management integrating demand forecasting into inventory management in this way also allows for the prediction of the '' can fit '' point when inventory storage is limited on a per-product basis one early example of inventory proportionality used in a retail application in the united states was for motor fuel the motorists do not know whether they are buying gasoline off the top or bottom of the tank , nor need they care excess inventory is not seen or valued by the consumer , so it is simply cash sunk ( literally ) into the ground inventory proportionality minimizes the amount of excess inventory carried in underground storage tanks the use of inventory proportionality in the united states is thought to have been inspired by japanese just-in-time parts inventory management made famous by toyota motors in the 1980s a variety of attempts to achieve this were unsuccessful due to the huge overhead of the information processing of the time the dominance of financial reporting accounting over management accounting remains to this day with few exceptions , and the financial reporting definitions of 'cost ' have distorted effective management 'cost ' accounting since that time the second formula then creates the new start point for the next period and gives a figure to be subtracted from the sales price to determine some form of sales-margin figure manufacturing management is more interested in inventory turnover ratio or average days to sell inventory since it tells them something about relative inventory levels today , with multistage-process companies , there is much inventory that would once have been finished goods which is now held as 'work in process ' ( wip ) inventory may also cause significant tax expenses , depending on particular countries ' laws regarding depreciation of inventory , as in thor power tool company v standard cost accounting uses ratios called efficiencies that compare the labour and materials actually used to produce a good with those that the same goods would have required under '' standard '' conditions where banks may be reluctant to accept traditional collateral , for example in developing countries where land title may be lacking , inventory credit is a potentially important way of overcoming financing constraints the possibility of sudden falls in commodity prices means that they are usually reluctant to lend more than about 60 % of the value of the inventory at the time of the loan
