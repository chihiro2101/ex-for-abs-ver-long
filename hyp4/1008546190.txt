life delorean attended detroit 's public grade schools and was then accepted into cass technical high school , a technical high school for detroit 's honor students , where he signed up for the electrical curriculum his academic record and musical talents earned him a scholarship at lawrence institute of technology in the detroit suburb of highland park ( today known as lawrence technological university and located in southfield ) at lawrence , he excelled in the study of industrial engineering and was elected to the school 's honor society while back in college , he worked part-time at chrysler and at a local body shop , foreshadowing his later contributions to the automotive industry chrysler ran a post-graduate educational facility named the chrysler institute of engineering , which allowed delorean to advance his education while gaining real-world experience in automotive engineering in 1952 , delorean graduated from the chrysler institute with a master 's degree in automotive engineering and joined chrysler 's engineering team delorean 's time at chrysler lasted less than a year , ending in 1953 when he was offered a salary of us 14,000 at packard under the supervision of the engineer forest mcfarland while still a profitable company , packard suffered alongside other independents as it struggled to compete when ford and general motors engaged in a price war a subsequent proposed merger with american motors corporation ( amc ) never passed the discussion phase kelley , vice president of engineering at general motors , a man whom delorean greatly admired kelley called to offer delorean his choice of a job in any of five divisions of gm knudsen was the son of the former president of gm , william knudsen , who was called away from his post to head the war mobilization production effort at the request of president roosevelt as a slightly bigger chevrolet , the pontiac brand reached third place in total annual industry sales in the united states this marked the beginning of pontiac 's renaissance as gm 's performance division instead of its previous position with no clear brand identity delorean received almost total credit for its success – conceptualizing , engineering , and marketing – becoming the golden boy of pontiac , and was rewarded with his 1965 promotion to head the entire pontiac division at the age of 40 , delorean had broken the record for youngest division head at gm and was determined to continue his string of successes in response to the '' pony car '' market dominated by the wildly successful ford mustang , delorean asked gm executives for permission to market a smaller version of the pontiac banshee show car for 1966 delorean 's version was rejected because of gm 's concern that his design would take away sales from the corvette , their flagship performance vehicle sales were sagging by this time , however , but the 1969 model would have its own distinct body shell with drivetrain and chassis components from the intermediate-sized pontiac a-body ( tempest , lemans , gto ) the new model offered a sportier , high performance , somewhat smaller , and lower-priced alternative to the other personal luxury cars then on the market , such as the ford thunderbird , buick riviera , lincoln continental mark iii , and oldsmobile toronado during his time at pontiac , delorean had begun to enjoy the freedom and celebrity that came with his position and spent a good deal of his time traveling to locations around the world to support promotional events even as general motors experienced revenue declines , pontiac remained highly profitable under delorean , and despite his growing reputation as a corporate maverick , on february 15 , 1969 , he was again promoted by this time ,

time to streamline chevrolet 's production overhead and reduce assembly costs the vega was assigned to chevrolet by corporate management , specifically by gm president ed cole , just weeks before delorean 's 1969 arrival as chevrolet division 's general manager in a motor trend interview in august 1970 , delorean said , '' vega will be the highest quality product ever built by chevrolet '' but in 1972 , general motors assembly division ( gmad ) took over the chevrolet lordstown assembly plant and adjoining fisher body plant incomplete and often non-functioning cars soon filled the factory lot , which then had to be reprocessed and repaired by a team assigned to this task by delorean delorean regrouped for the 1973 model year with vega sales of 395,792 the one-millionth vega was built in may 1973 , a month after delorean 's gm resignation rodden at random in 1972 , delorean was appointed to the position of vice president of car and truck production for the entire general motors
