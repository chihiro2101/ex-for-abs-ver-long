there is specialized equipment used by team ropers : rope - made of synthetic fibers , used to rope the steer , there are two kinds of ropes , one for the header ( the person who ropes the head ) and one for the heeler ( the person who ropes the legs ) horn wraps - protective wraps that go around the horns of the steer to prevent rope burns and reduce the risk of a horn breaking when roped then , one at a time , a steer is moved into a chute with spring-loaded doors in front and a solid gate behind , so that only one animal is released at a time the header is on one side ( usually the left , for a right-handed header ) whose job is to rope the steer around the horns , then turn the steer so its hind legs can be roped by the '' heeler '' , who starts from the box on the other side of the chute a taut rope , called the barrier , runs in front of the header 's box and is fastened to an easily released rope on the neck of the steer of a designated length , used to ensure that the steer gets a head start when the header is ready , he or she calls for the steer and an assistant pulls a lever , opening the chute doors when he or she has a clear throw , the heeler throws a loop of rope under the running steer 's hind legs and catches them there is a 5-second penalty for roping only one hind leg and a 10-second penalty for breaking the barrier if both occur on the same run then the penalties are added together for a total of 15 seconds added the header has three possible legal catches : both horns one horn and the nose ( half-head ) the neck any other head catch is considered illegal the lay of the loop is also very important ; it should stand up against the steer 's legs with the bottom loop on the ground so the steer will jump right into it
