when performing block-based discrete cosine transform ( dct ) coding for quantization , as in jpeg-compressed images , several types of artifacts can appear at low bit rates , any lossy block-based coding scheme introduces visible artifacts in pixel blocks and at block boundaries these boundaries can transform block boundaries , prediction block boundaries , or both , and may coincide with macroblock boundaries the transform ( for example the discrete cosine transform ) is applied to a block of pixels , and to achieve lossy compression , the transform coefficients of each block are quantized statistically , images have more low-frequency than high-frequency content , so it is the low-frequency content that remains after quantization , which results in blurry , low-resolution blocks in the most extreme case only the dc-coefficient , that is the coefficient which represents the average color of a block , is retained , and the transform block is only a single color after reconstruction no post-processing technique has been shown to improve image quality in all cases ; consequently , none has garnered widespread acceptance , though some have been implemented and are in use in proprietary systems motion compensation block boundary artifacts in motion-predicted video coding with a closed prediction loop , the encoder uses the decoder output as the prediction reference from which future frames are predicted when the psychoacoustic model is inaccurate , when the transform block size is restrained , or when aggressive compression is used , this may result in compression artifacts compression artifacts in compressed audio typically show up as ringing , pre-echo , '' birdie artifacts '' , drop-outs , rattling , warbling , metallic ringing , an underwater feeling , hissing , or '' graininess '' compression artifacts may intentionally be used as a visual style , sometimes known as glitch art davis in collaboration with paperrad , and more recently used by david oreilly and within music videos for chairlift and by nabil elderkin in the '' welcome to heartbreak '' music video for kanye west
