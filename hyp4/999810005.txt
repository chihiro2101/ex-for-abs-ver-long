thumb modern mmus typically divide the virtual address space ( the range of addresses used by the processor ) into pages , each having a size which is a power of 2 , usually a few kilobytes , but they may be much larger the bottom bits of the address ( the offset within a page ) are left unchanged the upper address bits are the virtual page numbers most mmus use an in-memory table of items called a '' page table '' , containing one '' page table entry '' ( pte ) per page , to map virtual page numbers to physical page numbers in main memory an associative cache of ptes is called a translation lookaside buffer ( tlb ) and is used to avoid the necessity of accessing the main memory every time a virtual address is mapped other mmus may have a private array of memory or registers that hold a set of page table entries the physical page number is combined with the page offset to give the complete physical address sometimes , a pte prohibits access to a virtual page , perhaps because no physical random access memory has been allocated to that virtual page the operating system ( os ) then handles the situation , perhaps by trying to find a spare frame of ram and set up a new pte to map it to the requested virtual address with some mmus , there can also be a shortage of ptes , in which case the os will have to free one for the new mapping typically , an operating system assigns each program its own virtual address space after blocks of memory have been allocated and freed , the free memory may become fragmented ( discontinuous ) so that the largest contiguous block of free memory may be much smaller than the total amount with virtual memory , a contiguous range of virtual addresses can be mapped to several non-contiguous blocks of physical memory ; this non-contiguous allocation is one of the benefits of paging most modern systems divide memory into pages that are in size , often with the capability to use so called huge pages of or in size ( often both variants are possible ) some systems , mainly older risc designs , trap into the os when a page translation is not found in the tlb ; p1 space : ( or control space ) which is also per-process and is typically used for supervisor , executive , kernel , user stacks and other per-process control structures managed by the operating system the vax mmu is notable for lacking an accessed bit oses which implement paging must find some way to emulate the accessed bit if they are to operate efficiently typically , the os will periodically unmap pages so that page-not-present faults can be used to let the os set an accessed bit arm uses a two-level page table if using and pages , or just a one-level page table for sections and sections tlb updates are performed automatically by page table walking hardware it has the unusual feature of storing accessed and dirty bits outside of the page table ( along with the four bit protection key for all s/360 processors ) starting in august , 1972 , the ibm system/370 has a similar mmu , although it initially supported only a 24-bit virtual address space rather than the 32-bit virtual address space of the system/360 model 67 full read/write/execute permission bits are supported a pfn stores the physical address without the page mask bits a tlb modified exception is generated when a store instruction references a mapped address and the matching entry 's dirty status is not set if a tlb exception occurs when processing a tlb exception , a double fault tlb exception , it is dispatched to its own exception handler mips32 and mips32r2 support 32 bits of virtual address space and up to 36 bits of physical address space mips64 supports up to 64 bits of virtual address space and up to 59 bits of physical address space sharing of virtual address space and inter-context communications can be provided by writing the same values in to the segment or page maps of different contexts the 52-bit address is hashed , then used as an index into the off-chip table with pages , there are only three levels of page table , for a total of 27 bits used in paging and 21 bits of offset in all levels of the page table , the page table entry includes a nx bit bit first , in the mapping of virtual memory addresses , instead of needing an mmu , the mcp systems are descriptor-based the mcp system is inherently secure and thus has no need of an mmu to provide this level of memory protection
