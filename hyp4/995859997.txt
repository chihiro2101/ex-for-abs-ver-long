succinylcholine chloride injection indicated , in addition to general anesthesia , to facilitate tracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation its medical uses are limited to short-term muscle relaxation in anesthesia and intensive care , usually for facilitation of endotracheal intubation it is indicated , in addition to general anesthesia , to facilitate tracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation suxamethonium is also commonly used as the sole muscle relaxant during electroconvulsive therapy , favoured for its short duration of action suxamethonium is quickly degraded by plasma butyrylcholinesterase and the duration of effect is usually in the range of a few minutes in people with neuromuscular disease or burns , an injection of suxamethonium can lead to a large release of potassium from skeletal muscles , potentially resulting in cardiac arrest the side effect of high blood potassium may occur because the acetylcholine receptor is propped open , allowing continued flow of potassium ions into the extracellular fluid a typical increase of potassium ion serum concentration on administration of suxamethonium is 0.5 & nbsp ; mmol per liter high blood potassium does not generally result in adverse effects below a concentration of 6.5 to 7 meq per liter malignant hyperthermia ( mh ) from suxamethonium administration can result in a drastic and uncontrolled increase in skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism the normal short duration of action of suxamethonium is due to the rapid metabolism of the drug by non-specific plasma cholinesterases mivacurium , a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug , is also metabolized via the same route with a similar clinical effect in patients deficient in plasma cholinesterase activity in normal skeletal muscle , acetylcholine dissociates from the receptor following depolarization and is rapidly hydrolyzed by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase suxamethonium has a longer duration of effect than acetylcholine , and is not hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase
