chromosomes were first observed in plant cells by carl wilhelm von nägeli in 1842 their behavior in animal ( salamander ) cells was described by walther flemming , the discoverer of mitosis , in 1882 the name was coined by another german anatomist , heinrich von waldeyer in 1888 in 1922 seems to have been the first person to define the karyotype as the phenotypic appearance of the somatic chromosomes , in contrast to their gene contents 3rd ed , cambridge university press painter in 1922 was not certain whether the diploid of humans was 46 or 48 , at first favoring 46 , but revised his opinion from 46 to 48 , and he correctly insisted on humans having an xx/xy system human chromosome 2 is now known to be a result of an end-to-end fusion of two ancestral ape chromosomes human chromosome 2 is a fusion of two ancestral evidence of common ancestry : human chromosome 2 ( video ) 2007 for humans , white blood cells are used most frequently because they are easily induced to divide and grow in tissue culture sometimes observations may be made on non-dividing ( interphase ) cells the sex of an unborn fetus can be determined by observation of interphase cells ( see amniocentesis and barr body ) six different characteristics of karyotypes are usually observed and compared : differences in absolute sizes of chromosomes for example , the legumes lotus tenuis and vicia faba each have six pairs of chromosomes , yet v humans have one pair fewer chromosomes than the great apes human chromosome 2 appears to have resulted from the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes , and many of the genes of those two original chromosomes have been translocated to other chromosomes differences in degree and distribution of heterochromatin regions heterochromatin consists mainly of genetically inactive and repetitive dna sequences as well as containing a larger amount of adenine-thymine pairs a full account of a karyotype may therefore include the number , type , shape and banding of the chromosomes , as well as other cytogenetic information the typical human karyotypes contain 22 pairs of autosome chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes ( allosomes ) the most common karyotypes for females contain two x chromosomes and are denoted 46 , xx ; males usually have both an x and a y chromosome denoted 46 , xy approximately 1.7 % percent of humans are intersex , sometimes due to variations in sex chromosomes although the replication and transcription of dna is highly standardized in eukaryotes , the same can not be said for their karyotypes , which are highly variable there is variation between species in chromosome number , and in detailed organization , despite their construction from the same chromatin this process is a carefully organised genome rearrangement where new telomeres are constructed and certain heterochromatin regions are lost the inactivation of one x chromosome takes place during the early development of mammals ( see barr body and dosage compensation ) the high record would be somewhere amongst the ferns , with the adder 's tongue fern ophioglossum ahead with an average of 1262 chromosomes the fundamental number , fn , of a karyotype is the number of visible major chromosomal arms per set of chromosomes thus , fn ≤ 2 x 2n , the difference depending on the number of chromosomes considered single-armed ( acrocentric or telocentric ) present polyploidy , where there are more than two sets of homologous chromosomes in the cells , occurs mainly in plants the proportion of flowering plants which are polyploid was estimated by stebbins to be 30–35 % , but in grasses the average is much higher , about 70 % polyploidy in animals is much less common , but it has been significant in some groups in many instances , endopolyploid nuclei contain tens of thousands of chromosomes ( which can not be exactly counted ) this would give rise to a chromosome abnormality such as an extra chromosome or one or more chromosomes lost down syndrome and turner syndrome are examples of this aneuploidy may also occur within a group of closely related species human chromosome 2 was formed by a merger of ancestral chromosomes , reducing the number each chromosome has a characteristic banding pattern that helps to identify them ; both chromosomes in a pair will have the same banding pattern multicolor fish and the older spectral karyotyping are molecular cytogenetic techniques used to simultaneously visualize all the pairs of chromosomes in an organism in different colors thus , chromosomes or chromosome sections can be visualized and identified , allowing for the analysis of chromosomal rearrangements edwards syndrome is caused by trisomy ( three copies ) of chromosome 18 1p36 deletion syndrome , from the loss of part of the short arm of chromosome 1
