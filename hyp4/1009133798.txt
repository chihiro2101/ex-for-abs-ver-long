nearby evidence within wonderwerk cave , at the edge of the kalahari desert , has been called the oldest known controlled fire the data suggests humans were cooking prey by campfire as far back as the first appearance of homo erectus 1.9 million years ago ideally , campfires should be made in a fire ring if a fire ring is not available , a temporary fire site may be constructed alternatively , turf may be cut away to form a bare area and carefully replaced after the fire has cooled to minimize damage a ring of rocks is sometimes constructed around a fire fire rings , however , do not fully protect material on the ground from catching fire having enough water nearby and a shovel to smother an out-of-control fire with dirt when extinguishing a campfire , using plenty of water or dirt , then stirring the mixture and add more water , then check that there are no burning embers left whatsoever making sure the fire pit is large enough for the campfire and there are no combustibles near the campfire , and avoiding the construction of the campfire on a windy day tinder lights easily and is used to start an enduring campfire it is anything that can be lit with a spark and is usually classified as being thinner than your little finger the tinder of choice before matches and lighters was amadou next to flint and steel kindling wood is an arbitrary classification including anything bigger than tinder but smaller than fuel wood a separate tipi as a shell around the first one may work better tipi fires are excellent for producing heat to keep people warm one downside to a tipi fire is that when it burns , the logs become unstable and can fall over the kindling is then stacked around it , as in the construction of a log cabin more kindling is added in the same manner of all the fire-builds , the log cabin is the least vulnerable to premature collapse , but it is also inefficient because it makes the worst use of convection to ignite progressively larger pieces of fuel however , these qualities make the log cabin an ideal cooking fire as it burns for a long period of time and can support cookware a variation on the log cabin starts with two pieces of fuelwood with a pile of tinder between them , and small kindling laid over the tops of the logs , above the tinder the tinder is lit , and the kindling is allowed to catch fire when it is burning briskly , it is broken and pushed down into the consumed tinder , and the larger kindling is placed over the top of the logs another variation is called the funeral pyre method because it is used for building funeral pyres its main difference from the standard log cabin is that it starts with thin pieces and moves up to thick pieces a hybrid fire combines the elements of both the tipi and the log cabin creating an easily lit yet stable fire structure the hybrid is made by first erecting a small tipi and then proceeding to construct a log cabin around it then kindling is placed with one end propped up by the larger piece of fuelwood , and the other resting on the ground so that the kindling is leaning over the tinder pile kindling and tinder are placed between the logs in sufficient quantity ( while avoiding the very ends ) to raise the upper log and allow ventilation the tinder is always lit at the center so the bolstering posts near the ends do not burn prematurely a star fire , or indian fire , is the fire design often depicted as the campfire of the old west campers sometimes use elaborate grills , cast iron pots , and fire irons to cook water is continuously poured until the hissing stops , then the ashes are stirred to ensure that water reaches the entire fire , and more water is added if necessary if water is scarce , sand is used to deprive the fire of oxygen in lightly used wilderness areas , the area around the campfire is cleaned up to make it look untouched after the fire is extinguished wood and cardboard are used as tinder file : scoutcampfire.jpg a campfire that seems to produce sparks , due to a long exposure when photographed
