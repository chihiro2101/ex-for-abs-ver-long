every color-managed device requires a personalized table , or '' color profile , '' which characterizes the color response of that particular device each color profile describes these colors relative to a standardized set of reference colors ( the '' profile connection space '' ) color-managed software then uses these standardized profiles to translate color from one device to another this is usually performed by a color management module ( cmm ) to describe the behavior of various output devices , they must be compared ( measured ) in relation to a standard color space this avoidance of the complexity of color management was one of the goals in the development of srgb the icc standard permits the exchange of output device characteristics and color spaces in the form of metadata color transformation , or color space conversion , is the transformation of the representation of a color from one color space to another transforming profiled color information to different output devices is achieved by referencing the profile data into a standard color space it makes it easier to convert colors from one device to a selected standard color space and from that to the colors of another device color transformations can be represented by two profiles ( source profile and target profile ) or by a devicelink profile color management : color space conversion , cambridge in color icc specification icc.1:2010 before the actual rendering intent is carried out , one can temporarily simulate the rendering by soft proofing since 1997 color management in windows is available through an icc color management system ( icm ) , notable browser support for color management is : firefox : from version 3.5 enabled by default for icc v2 tagged images , version 8.0 has icc v4 profiles support , but it needs to be activated manually gamma correction color chart digital printing icc profile international color consortium it8 linux color management
