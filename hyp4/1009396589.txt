the word individuation occurs with different meanings and connotations in different fields philosophically , '' individuation '' expresses the general idea of how a thing is identified as an individual thing that '' is not something else '' this includes how an individual person is held to be different from other elements in the world and how a person is distinct from other persons by the seventeenth century , philosophers began to associate the question of individuation or what brings about individuality at any one time with the question of identity or what constitutes sameness at different points in time other psychoanalytic theorists describe it as the stage where an individual transcends group attachment and narcissistic self-absorption the media industry has begun using the term individuation to denote new printing and online technologies that permit mass customization of the contents of a newspaper , a magazine , a broadcast program , or a website so that its contents match each individual user 's unique interests however privacy advocates argue privacy harms can also arise from the ability to disambiguate or ‘ single out ’ a person doing so enables the person , at an individual level , to be tracked , profiled , targeted , contacted , or subject to a decision or action which impacts them - even if their ‘ identity ’ is not known ( or knowable ) , as in schrödinger 's cat being simultaneously dead and alive , is mathematically not the same as assuming the cat is in an individual alive state with 50 % probability the heisenberg 's uncertainty principle says that complementary variables , such as position and momentum , can not both be precisely known – in some sense , they are not individual variables individuation is a process of transformation whereby the personal and collective unconscious are brought into consciousness ( e.g in l'individuation psychique et collective , gilbert simondon developed a theory of individual and collective individuation in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation rather than a cause the i is essentially a process , not a state , and this process is an in-dividuation — it is a process of psychic individuation this process of triple individuation is itself inscribed within a vital individuation which must be apprehended as the vital individuation of natural organs , the technological individuation of artificial organs , and the psycho-social individuation of organizations linking them together
