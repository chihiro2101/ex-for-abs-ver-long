a significant number of moorcock 's novels and short stories take place in one shared multiverse : a wide array of interconnected parallel universes , many-layered dimensions , spheres , and alternative worlds , which spans from the big bang to the end of time and from earth to faraway galaxies all the different eternal champions are implied to be different facets or '' incarnations '' of one semi-conscious being ( a platonic archetype of a sort ) : most of them are peerless fighters and generals and have an unbreakable bond with a sentient chaos-aligned weapon , the black sword , which in turns takes on a different form for each champion this recursivity through the multiverse is further underlined by the number of champions , companions , and mentor-figures to the champions moorcock has given the j and c initials , as a form of naming fil rouge ; in the same vein , many champions and companions belong to one branch or another of the extensive von bek dynasty space- and time-travels through the multiverse are in fact possible , to the point that one humanoid species called the eldrens is spread among many different worlds and ages and interacts with many different champions ; however , cosmic laws establish that no two eternal champions can coexist in the same situation , or the very fabric of reality would be severely damaged moorcock planned a whole series about aubec 's wars against melniboné in order to ensure human independence , eventually reconnecting to elric 's saga as a direct prequel , but the project was eventually aborted ; consequently , '' the dream of earl aubec '' was reincorporated into elric 's series as a prologue captain oswald bastable : the main character and narrator of the nomad of time trilogy ( 1971-1981 ) , captain bastable is an officer of the british imperial army stationed in the raj in the early 20th century , until a series of time-travel incidents transports him into three different uchronia : a 1973 where the world wars have not been fought and the british empire is now encroached by decolonizing movements ; a 1904 where europe has been left in tatters by a precocious and even more devastating great war ; a 1941 where the british and german empires are firmly allied amelia underwood , a time traveler from the nineteenth century ; the couple 's courtship , relationship and shared adventures across time and space are the subject of a trilogy called the dancers at the end of time ( 1972-1976 ) ; this series is complemented by the legends at the end of time : five semi-autonomous short stories and novelettes taking place at the end of time , themselves composed in the late seventies ( with an additional sixth one being published in 2008 ) jerry cornelius : an adventurer and dimensional traveler moorcock created in the mid-sixties and developed for the following forty years , resulting in an early tetralogy of novels , the cornelius quartet ( 1968-1977 ) , a ponderous collection of short fiction , the lives and times of jerry cornelius ( 1976 ) , and a later hexalogy of novels , the cornelius calendar ( composed in two stages , 1976-1981 and 2002-2008 ) , with more tales in the working cornelius ' saga consists of a wide array of surreal situations kept together by the character 's uniquely fluid identity and it represents an influential form of experimental literature in the wider context of psychedelia this series also includes two spin-off works , a doctor who licensed novel titled the coming of the terraphiles ( 2010 ) , whose captain cornelius is , in fact , jerry 's incarnation in the whoniverse ; and the distant suns ( 1975 ) , a late example of pulp space opera moorcock co-authored with james cawthorn , depicting jerry as an air force colonel and a space explorer jerry cornell : in 1966 moorcock edited ( and in fact ghost-wrote ) a sizeable section of the spy novel the lsd dossier by roger harris and eventually authored two novels starring harris 's original main character , secret agent nick allard ; later on moorcock revised his solo works into a stand-alone series centered upon agent jerry cornell ( 1970-1980 ) , an overt parody of character tropes and clichés from ian fleming 's james bond series prince flamadin : flamadin is the ruler of a dimension called draachenheem and owns both the dragon sword ( a black sword comparable in power to ulrik skarlson 's cold sword ) and the actoris stone , an enchanted gem that would later become elric of melniboné 's family heirloom in the dragon in the sword ( 1986 ) daker as flamadin and his companion from 20th century germany , ulrich von bek , travel across many interconnected dimensions to prevent a major cataclysm elric of melniboné : moorcock 's breakthrough character , elric lives in a prehistorical age of earth and is the sorcerer-emperor of the melnibonéans , a pre-human species of chaos-aligned feys ( later retconned into being a branch of the eldren ) ; he wields the soul-eating sword stormbringer , on which he is co-dependent due to its frail health , and spends his life trying to thwart the chaos god arioch , who is also his undesired personal patron due to an ancestral melnibonéan tradition ; the first and last novels in this series also feature mournblade , stormbringer 's twin sword , which is wielded by elric 's kinsmen elric 's series represents a major milestone in sword & sorcery fiction and , unlike moorcock 's later works , was composed anachronically : it originally consisted of seven short stories and a stormbringer ( novel ) written from 1961 to 1967 , but it was later expanded with an origin story , a prequel and a midquel in the early seventies , a third prequel and a second midquel in the early nineties , and some more peripheral contents during the early 21st century jack karaquazian : a leading character in the second ether trilogy ( 1995-1996 ) , which depicts the power struggles between god-like beings ( such as karaquazian himself ) of lawful , chaotic and neutral affiliation to take control of balance and swing it their own respective way the 1996 revision of the winds of limbo renamed powys into '' alain von bek '' in order to retcon him into a distant von bek , but this change was eventually dropped in the 2014 reprint eric beck : the main character of the graphic novel elric : the balance lost ( 2011-2012 ) , he is an eternal champion living on 21st century earth and gets dragged into an ensemble adventure together with elric , hawkmoon , corum , oswald bastable , and the cast of the second ether series between 1992 and 1993 moorcock partnered with british publisher millenium ( later absorbed into the orion publishing group ) to print a multi-volume collection of all novels and short stories belonging to the eternal champion sequence , under the moniker of '' the tale of the eternal champion '' ; starting from 1994 and up to 2000 , a parallel project simply called '' the eternal champion '' was undertaken by white wolf publishing for the north american market , but each of the two series ended up including some contents left out of its counterpart due to licensing issues , while certain works could not make into the collection whatsoever
