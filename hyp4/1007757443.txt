typically these powers are : to grant pardon ; to dismiss a prime minister ; to refuse to dissolve parliament ; and to refuse or delay royal assent to legislation ( to withhold royal assent amounts to a veto of a bill , while to reserve royal assent in effect amounts to a decision to neither grant nor refuse assent , but to delay taking a decision for an undetermined period ) using these powers in contravention of tradition would generally provoke a constitutional crisis in such an order , the reserve powers are thought to be the means by which the monarch and his or her viceregal representatives can legitimately exist as '' constitutional guardians '' or '' umpires '' , tasked with guaranteeing that cabinet and parliament adhere to the fundamental constitutional principles of the rule of law and responsible government itself some constitutional scholars , such as george winterton , have stated that reserve powers are a good thing in that they allow for a head of state to handle an unforeseen crisis and that the use of convention to limit the use of reserve powers allows for more gradual and subtle constitutional evolution than is possible through formal amendment of a written constitution evatt felt that the reserve powers could be codified and still serve their intended function in a responsible government system , as they do in ireland , japan , and sweden in belgium a constitutional provision explicitly states that no act of the monarch is valid without the signature of a member or members of the government , which thereby becomes solely responsible , hence excluding any reserve power for the crown in legal terminology , a competence vested in 'the king ' thus very often means the government , as opposed to formal laws which require a ( sometimes qualified ) parliamentary majority in 1990 , when a law liberalising belgium 's abortion laws was approved by parliament , king baudouin refused to give his royal assent , only the second time in belgium 's history the monarch elected to do so after the balfour declaration was produced by the 1926 imperial conference , formally establishing the autonomy and equal status of commonwealth governments , governors-general ceased to be advised in any way by the british government while the reserve power to dismiss a government has not been used in the united kingdom since 1834 , this power has been exercised more recently in australia , on two occasions : on 13 may 1932 , when the governor of new south wales philip game lang dismissal crisis on 11 november 1975 , when the governor-general of australia sir john kerr 1975 australian constitutional crisis in queensland in 1987 , during a tense period of leadership succession , the governor of queensland , sir walter campbell , exercised reserve power in declining to follow the advice of the premier , sir joh bjelke-petersen subsequently , during a period when queensland had a '' premier who is not leader '' and the governing party had a '' leader who is not premier '' , peter bowers and greg roberts , ‘ ahern leads , but joh rules ’ , sydney morning herald , 27 november 1987 owen dixon society ejournal ( gold coast , queensland : bond university , 2007 ) there was speculation on the potential exercise of vice-regal reserve power by campbell , in dismissing the premier in the absence of a parliamentary motion of no confidence barlow & corkery '' sir walter campbell '' , 28-29 these are among several exercises of the reserve powers in australia in the 20th century at state and federal levels the reserve powers in canada fall within the royal prerogative and belong specifically to the monarch , as the constitution act , 1867 , vests all executive power in the country 's sovereign peter hogg , a constitutional scholar , has opined that '' a system of responsible government can not work without a formal head of state who is possessed of certain reserve powers they also had a real choice in selecting premiers – parliaments of the period being composed of independent members who formed loose and shifting factions – and were not always obliged to act on the advice of their ministers sir kenneth keith describes the use of these powers as based on the principle that '' the queen reigns , but the government rules , so long as it has the support of the house of representatives '' the most visible reserve powers are the power to appoint a prime minister and the related power to accept a prime minister 's resignation though the power of appointment is listed among the reserve powers , in fact the governor-general abides by strict conventions , and has always appointed the leader of the dominant party in the house of representatives in earlier times , if a prime minister died , became incapacitated , or resigned unexpectedly , a governor-general might be able to choose a temporary prime minister from among several senior ministers , while the governing party decided on a new leader who would then be duly appointed prime minister today , however , the practice of appointing – on prime ministerial advice – a permanent deputy prime minister , who becomes acting prime minister when needed , has largely removed even this discretion from the governor-general the governor-general may dismiss an incumbent prime minister and cabinet , an individual minister , or any other official who holds office '' during the queen 's pleasure '' or '' during the governor-general 's pleasure '' conventionally , the governor-general follows the advice of the prime minister or another appropriate minister in matters of appointment and dismissal the governor-general can also dissolve parliament and call elections without prime ministerial advice a prime minister who has lost the confidence of the house will conventionally either advise a dissolution of parliament and new elections , or tender his resignation likewise , if the prime minister tenders his resignation , the governor-general could theoretically refuse to accept it , and dissolve parliament against the prime minister 's advice a governor-general can also refuse a prime minister 's request to dissolve parliament and hold elections if a prime minister has been defeated by a vote of no confidence , a refusal by the governor-general to dissolve parliament would , in effect , force the prime minister to resign and make way for a successor others , such as professor philip joseph , believe the governor-general does retain the power to refuse royal assent to bills in exceptional circumstances - such as the abolition of democracy two successive governors , the earl of onslow and the earl of glasgow , refused to make the appointments , until the colonial office intervened in ballance 's favour though these remained the same in law for the time being , later governors and governments considered that there would be far fewer scenarios in which their use would be appropriate the outgoing prime minister , sir rob muldoon , had just lost an election , but refused to advise the governor-general , david beattie , to make urgent regulations desired not only by the incoming prime minister , david lange , but also by many in muldoon 's own party and cabinet at the time , the option of beattie dismissing muldoon and replacing him , without waiting for muldoon 's resignation , was reportedly discussed muldoon eventually relented under pressure from his own cabinet , making the use of beattie 's reserve powers unnecessary the constitution of tuvalu provides , in article 52 , that the governor-general exercises his powers '' only in accordance with the advice of ( a ) the cabinet ; or ( b ) the prime minister in 2013 , governor-general iakoba italeli was requested by the opposition to act without ( and indeed against ) the prime minister 's advice the opposition immediately called for the government to reconvene parliament , so that a motion of no confidence could be introduced , and a new government formed for example , in the hung parliament in 1974 , the serving prime minister , edward heath , attempted to remain in power but was unable to form a working majority following japan 's defeat in world war ii , the emperor 's role is defined in chapter i of the 1947 constitution of japan , as decided by the foreign powers that had defeated japan in the war the constitution of spain does not specifically grant emergency powers to the government , though does state in article 56 that the monarch '' arbitrates and moderates the regular functioning of the institutions '' , and invests the monarch with the responsibility of overseeing that the forms of the constitution are observed the president of ireland does not possess executive powers : executive powers are held by the government , which is headed by a taoiseach ( prime minister ) , who is chosen by and accountable to dáil éireann ( house of representatives ) however , the president has certain reserve powers , also known as '' discretionary powers '' in ireland , which can be exercised by the president at his or her discretion – without , or even contrary to , the government 's advice by the second of these powers , the president may refuse to assent to legislation passed by parliament when he or she considers it to be unconstitutional
