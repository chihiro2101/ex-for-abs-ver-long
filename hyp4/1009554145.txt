an alabama law authorized teachers to set aside one minute at the start of each day for a moment for '' meditation or voluntary prayer ishmael jaffree , an american citizen , was a resident of mobile county , alabama and a parent of three students who attended school in the mobile county public school system ; two of the three children were in the second grade and the third was in kindergarten on may 28 , 1982 , jaffree brought suit naming the mobile county school board , various school officials , and the minor plaintiffs ' three teachers as defendants jaffree sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction restraining the defendants from '' maintaining or allowing the maintenance of regular religious prayer services or other forms of religious observances in the mobile county public schools in violation of the first amendment as made applicable to states by the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution the original complaint did n't mentioned any specific statutes , but the case later dealt with three laws for public schools in alabama : the first law ( 1978 ) created a minute of silence for meditation , the second law ( 1981 ) added the option of voluntary prayer , and the third law ( 1982 ) authorized teachers to recite a prayer with “ willing students '' the '' lemon test , '' previously created by the court to help determine whether legislation violates the establishment clause , included as a factor that '' the statute must have a secular legislative purpose , '' and the court further held in jaffree that '' the first amendment requires that a statute must be invalidated if it is entirely motivated by a purpose to advance religion '' with no secular purpose behind the law , and because it expanded a previous law that already allowed for meditation so that it now explicitly included '' voluntary prayer '' as well , the only possible conclusion was that the new law was passed '' for the sole purpose of expressing the state 's endorsement of prayer activities for one minute at the beginning of each schoolday he begins by pointing out that the statute authorizing a moment of silence at the beginning of a school day , which mentions the word “ prayer ” , does not , thereby , unconstitutionally promote a religion also in his first point , he contests the decision with the point that a school is constitutionally on the same level of government as state and federal legislatures and even the supreme court in his next point , burger emphasizes the tenuousness of the court 's peripheral reasoning , specifically including the statements of the statute 's sponsor and the differences between the statute and its predecessor statute next , to discuss the differences between the debated statute and its predecessor , he brings up the court 's opinion that the inclusion of the phrase “ or voluntary prayer ” endorses and promotes religion in his conclusion , justice burger reiterates the fact that the statute was not an unconstitutional endorsement and promotion of religion that sought to establish a state church , but an entirely constitutional measure designed to prevent truly unconstitutional infringement upon the rights of students to pray individually as they please through this , rehnquist maintains that the meaning of the establishment clause as a preventative measure to keep the government from establishing a religion but not to prevent the individual freedom to follow one 's own beliefs
