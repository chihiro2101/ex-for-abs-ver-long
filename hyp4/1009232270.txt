thumb the parabolic shape of a dish reflects the signal to the dish ’ s focal point direct broadcast satellite dishes use an lnbf , which integrates the feedhorn with the lnb a new form of omnidirectional satellite antenna , which does not use a directed parabolic dish and can be used on a mobile platform such as a vehicle was announced by the university of waterloo in 2004 a typical value for a consumer type 60 & nbsp ; cm satellite dish at 11.75 & nbsp ; ghz is 37.50 & nbsp ; db modern dishes intended for home television use are generally 43 & nbsp ; cm ( 18 & nbsp ; in ) to 80 & nbsp ; cm ( 31 & nbsp ; in ) in diameter , and are fixed in one position , for ku-band reception from one orbital position prior to the existence of direct broadcast satellite services , home users would generally have a motorised c-band dish of up to 3 m in diameter for reception of channels from different satellites overly small dishes can still cause problems , however , including rain fade and interference from adjacent satellites in the lnb they become down converted to 950–2150 & nbsp ; mhz , which is the frequency range allocated for the satellite service on the coaxial cable between lnbf and receiver only one of these frequency bands fits on the coaxial cable , so each of these bands needs a separate cable from the lnbf to a switching matrix or the receiver needs to select one of the 4 possibilities at a time in a single receiver residential installation there is a single coaxial cable running from the receiver set-top box in the building to the lnb on the dish thumb a satellite finder ( or sat finder ) is a satellite field strength meter used to accurately point satellite dishes at communications satellites in geostationary orbit with diseqc and usals , the satellite dish will automatically aim itself at one of sixteen satellites programmed in previously when pressing one of the channel buttons on the remote automatic tracking satellite dish satellitedish1.jpg general electric satellite dish for directv satellite television the term satellite dish was coined in 1978 during the beginning of the satellite television industry , and came to refer to dish antennas that send and/or receive signals from communications satellites the relatively strong k u band transmissions allowed the use of dishes as small as 90 & nbsp ; cm for the first time this was the first widely used direct-broadcast satellite television system and allowed dishes as small as 20 & nbsp ; inches to be used
