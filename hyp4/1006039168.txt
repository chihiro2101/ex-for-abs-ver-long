zirconium is one of the main components of zircon crystals , currently the oldest known minerals in the earth 's crust this period is known to have a large number of exceptions to the madelung rule it is an alkali metal , the most reactive group in the periodic table , having properties and similarities with both other alkali metals and other period 5 elements for example , rubidium has 5 electron shells , a property found in all other period 5 elements , whereas its electron configuration 's ending is similar to all other alkali metals : s 1 it is an alkaline earth metal , a relatively reactive group , although not nearly as reactive as the alkali metals strontium is a soft metal and is extremely reactive upon contact with water in addition , strontium , like rubidium , redox in air and turns a yellow color yttrium is a chemical element with symbol y and atomic number 39 it is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the lanthanides and it has often been classified as a '' rare earth element '' yttrium is almost always found combined with the lanthanides in rare earth minerals and is never found in nature as a free element in 1787 , carl axel arrhenius found a new mineral near ytterby in sweden and named it ytterbite , after the village elemental yttrium was first isolated in 1828 by friedrich wöhler the most important use of yttrium is in making phosphors , such as the red ones used in television set cathode ray tube ( crt ) displays and in leds zirconium is a chemical element with the symbol zr and atomic number 40 zirconium compounds have no biological role niobium , or columbium , is a chemical element with the symbol nb and atomic number 41 niobium is used mostly in alloys , the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines niobium is used in various superconducting materials these type-ii superconductor , also containing titanium and tin , are widely used in the superconducting magnets of mri scanners in the last two applications , niobium 's low toxicity and ability to be colored by anodizing are particular advantages molybdenum is a group 6 chemical element with the symbol mo and atomic number 42 it readily forms hard , stable carbides , and for this reason it is often used in high-strength steel alloys molybdenum does not occur as a free metal on earth , but rather in various oxidation states in minerals technetium is the chemical element with atomic number 43 and symbol tc many of technetium 's properties were predicted by dmitri mendeleev before the element was discovered mendeleev noted a gap in his periodic table and gave the undiscovered element the provisional name ekamanganese ( em ) its short-lived gamma ray-emitting nuclear isomer—technetium-99m—is used in nuclear medicine for a wide variety of diagnostic tests technetium-99 is used as a gamma ray-free source of beta particles ruthenium is a chemical element with symbol ru and atomic number 44 rhodium is a chemical element that is a rare , silvery-white , hard , and chemically inert transition metal and a member of the platinum group it has the chemical symbol rh and atomic number 45 because rhodium metal is inert against corrosion and most aggressive chemicals , and because of its rarity , rhodium is usually alloyed with platinum or palladium and applied in high-temperature and corrosion-resistive coatings palladium plays a key role in the technology used for fuel cells , which combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity , heat , and water silver is a metallic chemical element with the chemical symbol ag , from the indo-european root arg- for '' grey '' or '' shining '' ) and atomic number 47 a soft , white , lustrous transition metal , it has the highest electrical conductivity of any element and the highest thermal conductivity of any metal today , silver metal is also used in electrical contacts and conductors , in mirrors and in catalysis of chemical reactions tin shows chemical similarity to both neighboring group 14 elements , germanium and lead and has two possible oxidation states , +2 and the slightly more stable +4 after 600 bc pure metallic tin was produced martin heinrich klaproth named the new element in 1798 after the latin word for '' earth '' , tellus iodine is a chemical element with the symbol i and atomic number 53 rubidium , strontium , yttrium , zirconium , and niobium have no biological role
