in the southern hemisphere , the magellanic clouds have long been included in the lore of native inhabitants , including south sea islanders and indigenous australians between 1893 and 1906 , under the direction of solon bailey , the telescope at this site was used to survey photographically both the large and small magellanic clouds leavitt reaized that since all the stars in the smc are roughly the same distance from earth , this result implied that there is similar relationship between period and absolute brightness using this period-luminosity relation , in 1913 the distance to the smc was first estimated by ejnar hertzsprung announced in 2006 , measurements with the hubble space telescope suggest the large and small magellanic clouds may be moving too fast to be orbiting the milky way there is a bridge of gas connecting the small magellanic cloud with the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , which is evidence of tidal interaction between the galaxies the small magellanic cloud contains a large and active population of x-ray binary the smc was detected with an x-ray luminosity of 5 ergs/s in the range 1.5–12 kev , and 2.5 ergs/s in the range 5–50 kev for an apparently extended source visvanathan that the smc may in fact be split in two , with a smaller section of this galaxy behind the main part of the smc ( as seen from earth perspective ) , and separated by about 30,000 ly they have dubbed this smaller remnant the mini magellanic cloud small magellanic cloud in fiction large magellanic cloud magellanic clouds objects within the small magellanic cloud : ngc 265 ngc 290 ngc 346 ngc 602
