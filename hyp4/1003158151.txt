toad ramsey of the louisville colonels in the old american association—his pitch likely resembled the knuckle curve—and eddie cicotte of the chicago white sox , who in 1908 was nicknamed '' knuckles '' , are two possible creators of the pitch image : eddiecicotte55.jpg right thumb 167px eddie cicotte , who is sometimes credited with inventing the knuckleball as used by cicotte , the knuckleball was originally thrown by holding the ball with the knuckles , hence the name of the pitch ed summers , a pittsburgh teammate of cicotte who adopted the pitch and helped develop it , modified it by holding the ball with his fingertips and using the thumb for balance the fingertip grip is more commonly used today by knuckleball pitchers , like retired boston red sox pitcher tim wakefield , who had a knuckleball with a lot of movement there are other prominent knuckleball pitchers like hall of famer phil niekro , who had a very effective knuckler and knuckle curve , and cy young award winning pitcher r.a however , young pitchers with smaller hands tend to throw the knuckleball with their knuckles sometimes young players will throw the knuckleball with their knuckles flat against the ball , giving it less spin but also making it difficult to throw any significant distance regardless of how the ball is gripped , the purpose of the knuckleball is to have the least possible amount of rotational spin over the distance from the pitcher 's mound to home plate , the effect of these forces is that the knuckleball can flutter , dance , jiggle , or curve in two different directions during its flight even a ball thrown without rotation will '' flutter '' , due to the '' apparent wind '' it feels as its trajectory changes throughout its flight path hitting a knuckleball is different enough from other aspects of baseball that players specifically prepare for the pitch during batting practice before games they expect it in if a knuckleball does not change direction in mid-flight , however , then it is easy to hit due to its lack of speed to reduce the chances of having the knuckleball get hit for a home run , some pitchers will impart a slight topspin so that if no force causes the ball to dance , it will move downward in flight two later pitchers , jesse haines and freddie fitzsimmons , were sometimes characterized as knuckleball pitchers even by their contemporaries , but in their cases it again refers to a harder-thrown , curving pitch that would probably not be called a knuckleball today many current pitchers throw a curveball using a grip with the index finger touching the ball with the knuckle or fingertip ( also called a spike curve ) because the speed of any prospect 's pitch is one of the quickest and easiest metrics in judging the skill of the prospect , the knuckleball , which is thrown slower than any other pitch , gets overlooked '' former knuckleballer and pitching coach charlie hough says that the increased rarity of the knuckleball is due to scouts increasingly looking only for the best arm this effect is increasing over time as the modern game continues to emphasize power in pitching and average pitch speed increases hoyt wilhelm , phil niekro , and jesse haines , three pitchers who primarily relied on the knuckleball , have been inducted into the baseball hall of fame in november 2008 , it was announced that 16-year-old knuckleballer eri yoshida was drafted as the first woman ever to play in japanese professional baseball for the kobe 9 cruise of the kansai independent baseball league it is for this reason that the knuckleball is widely regarded as unreliable , and knuckleball pitchers are prone to extended slumps , such as when tim wakefield was released from the pirates in a mid-career slump during spring training in 1995 another reason for the difficulty of the knuckleball is due to the network effect it is almost never used in a mixed repertoire today , however , and some believe that to throw the knuckleball effectively with some semblance of control over the pitch , one must throw it more or less exclusively in baseball terminology the pitcher and catcher together are known as a '' battery '' , and having a catcher experienced in catching a knuckleball pitcher is preferable , so the trade of pitcher and catcher together is sometimes referred to as a '' batteries included '' trade in volleyball , the float serve involves hitting the volleyball in such a way to minimize the rotation of the ball , causing unpredictability in the ball ’ s movement knuckleball headquarters – comprehensive collection of information about the pitch and those who have thrown it the ( mostly ) complete list of knuckleball pitchers – a list of just about everyone who 's thrown the pitch in the major leagues , with links to each player 's career stats
