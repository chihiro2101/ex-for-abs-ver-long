patterns originated as an architectural concept by christopher alexander as early as 1977 ( c.f '' the pattern of streets , '' journal of the aip , september , 1977 , vol design patterns gained popularity in computer science after the book design patterns was published in 1994 by the so-called '' gang of four '' ( gamma et al that same year , the first pattern languages of programming conference was held , and the following year the portland pattern repository was set up for documentation of design patterns notable books in the design pattern genre include : although design patterns have been applied practically for a long time , formalization of the concept of design patterns languished for several years in order to achieve flexibility , design patterns usually introduce additional levels of indirection , which in some cases may complicate the resulting designs and hurt application performance since some authors see this as a step backward from software reuse as provided by components , researchers have worked to turn patterns into components efforts have also been made to codify design patterns in particular domains , including use of existing design patterns as well as domain specific design patterns the documentation for a design pattern describes the context in which the pattern is used , the forces within the context that the pattern seeks to resolve , and the suggested solution related patterns : other patterns that have some relationship with the pattern ; discussion of the differences between the pattern and similar patterns related observations were made by hannemann and kiczales who implemented several of the 23 design patterns using an aspect-oriented programming ( aspectj ) and showed that code-level dependencies were removed from the implementations of 17 of the 23 design patterns and that aspect-oriented programming could simplify the implementations of design patterns
