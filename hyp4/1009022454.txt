the term klezmer comes from a combination of hebrew words : klei , meaning '' tools , utensils or instruments of '' and zemer , '' melody '' ; leading to k'lei zemer , literally '' instruments of music '' or '' musical instruments '' originally , klezmer referred to musical instruments , and was later extended to refer , as a pejorative , to musicians themselves it was not until the late 20th century that the word came to identify a musical genre early 20th century recordings and writings most often refer to the style as '' yiddish '' music , although it is also sometimes called freilech music ( yiddish , literally '' happy music '' ) the first recordings to use the term '' klezmer '' to refer to the music were the klezmorim 's east side wedding and streets of gold in 1977/78 , followed by andy statman and zev feldman 's jewish klezmer music in 1979 klezmer is easily identifiable by its characteristic expressive melodies , reminiscent of the human voice , complete with laughing and weeping a number of dreydlekh ( a yiddish word for ornament ( music ) ) , such as krekhts ( '' sobs '' ) are used to produce this style various musical styles influenced traditional klezmer music klezmer musicians heard and adapted traditional romanian music , which is reflected in the dance forms found throughout surviving klezmer music repertoire ( e.g the bible has several descriptions of orchestras and levites making music , but after the destruction of the second temple in 70 ce , many rabbis discouraged musical instruments however , the importance of merrymaking at weddings was not diminished , and musicians came forth to fill that niche , klezmorim the first klezmer known by name was yakobius ben yakobius , a player of the aulos in samaria in the 2nd century ce it is unlikely that they played music recognizable as klezmer today since the style and structure of klezmer as we know it today is thought to have come largely from 19th century bessarabia , where the bulk of today 's traditional repertoire was written klezmorim based much of their secular instrumental music upon the devotional vocal music of the synagogue , in particular hazzan music klezmorim often travelled and played with romani musicians ( '' lÄƒutari '' ) , because they occupied similar social strata they sometimes played for christian churches and local aristocracy , and taught some italian classical violin virtuosos it was laid out like a cymbalom , and attracted comments from felix mendelssohn ( highly favourable ) and liszt ( condemnatory ) also , a shift towards brass and percussion happened when klezmorim were conscripted into military bands jews began to adopt mainstream culture , the popularity of klezmer waned , and jewish celebrations were increasingly accompanied by non-jewish music while traditional performances may have been on the decline , many jewish composers who had mainstream success , such as leonard bernstein and aaron copland , continued to be influenced by the klezmeric idioms heard during their youth ( as gustav mahler had been ) george gershwin was familiar with klezmer music , and the opening clarinet glissando of rhapsody in blue suggests this influence , although the composer did not compose klezmer directly dmitri shostakovich in particular admired klezmer music for embracing both the ecstasy and the despair of human life , and quoted several melodies in his chamber masterpieces , the piano quintet ( shostakovich ) ( 1940 ) , the piano trio no in the mid-to-late 1970s there was a klezmer revival in the united states and europe , led by giora feidman , the klezmorim , zev feldman , andy statman , and the klezmer conservatory band in 1985 , henry sapoznik and adrienne cooper founded klezkamp to teach klezmer and other yiddish music the 1980s saw a second wave of revival , as interest grew in more traditionally inspired performances with string instruments , largely with non-jews of the united states and germany bands like brave old world , hot pstromi and the klezmatics also emerged during this period in the 1990s , musicians from the san francisco bay area helped further interest in klezmer music by taking it into new territory interest in klezmer has been sustained and supported by such well-known avant-garde jazz musicians as john zorn and don byron , who sometimes blend klezmer with jazz the band 's most recent album mames babegenush with strings ( 2017 ) was warmly received with 5-6 stars reviews in such magazines as songlines and froots a separate klezmer tradition had developed in israel in the 20th century in order to preserve and promote klezmer music in israel , burstein founded the jerusalem klezmer association , which has become a center for learning and performance of klezmer music in the country few scions of klezmer dynasties remained in europe , one notable exception being leopold kozlowski of poland also , recordings specific to one area may not have represented klezmer repertoire from other parts of the region in the 21st century , klezmer is typically learned from '' fake books '' and transcriptions of old recordings , although the music was traditionally transmitted and learned by ear typically it is performed on violin , cymbalom or clarinet , though it has been done on banjo , xylophone , flute , cornet , saxophone , tuba , and many other instruments some klezmer revival bands look to loud-instrument klezmer , jazz , and dixieland for inspiration performers in this style include the klezmorim , the klezmatics , the klezmer conservatory band , and the maxwell street klezmer band yivo encyclopedia article on traditional and instrumental music of eastern european jews recordings of yiddish songs on the library of congress website
