the names somatotropin ( sth ) or somatotropic hormone refer to the growth hormone produced naturally in animals and extracted from carcasses hormone extracted from human cadavers is abbreviated hgh the main growth hormone produced by recombinant dna technology has the approved generic name ( inn ) somatropin and the brand name humatrope , and is properly abbreviated rhgh in the scientific literature genes for human growth hormone , known as growth hormone 1 ( somatotropin ; pituitary growth hormone ) and growth hormone 2 ( placental growth hormone ; growth hormone variant ) , are localized in the q22-24 region of chromosome 17 and are closely related to somatomammotropin ( also known as placental lactogen ) genes gh , human chorionic somatomammotropin , and prolactin belong to somatotropin family with growth-promoting and lactogenic activity the major isoform of the human growth hormone is a protein of 191 amino acids and a molecular weight of 22,124 daltons the structure includes four helices necessary for functional interaction with the gh receptor despite marked structural similarities between growth hormone from different species , only human and old world monkey growth hormones have significant effects on the human growth hormone receptor furthermore , these variants circulate partially bound to a protein ( growth hormone-binding protein , ghbp ) , which is the truncated part of the growth hormone receptor , and an acid-labile subunit ( als ) secretion of growth hormone ( gh ) in the pituitary is regulated by the neurosecretion nuclei of the hypothalamus these cells release the peptides growth hormone-releasing hormone ( ghrh or somatocrinin ) and somatostatin ( ghih or somatostatin ) into the hypophyseal portal venous blood surrounding the pituitary gh release in the pituitary is primarily determined by the balance of these two peptides , which in turn is affected by many physiological stimulators ( e.g somatotropic cells in the anterior pituitary gland then synthesize and secrete gh in a pulsatile manner , in response to these stimuli by the hypothalamus nearly fifty percent of gh secretion occurs during the third and fourth nrem sleep stages a number of factors are known to affect gh secretion , such as age , sex , diet , exercise , stress , and other hormones sleep deprivation generally suppresses gh release , particularly after early adulthood effects of growth hormone on the tissues of the body can generally be described as anabolic ( building up ) gh also stimulates , through the jak-stat signaling pathway , the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 ( igf-1 , formerly known as somatomedin c ) , a hormone homologous to proinsulin in some circumstances , focused radiation or a gh antagonist such as pegvisomant may be employed to shrink the tumor or block function adults with ghd '' tend to have a relative increase in fat mass and a relative decrease in muscle mass and , in many instances , decreased energy and quality of life '' several studies , primarily involving patients with gh deficiency , have suggested a crucial role of gh in both mental and emotional well-being and maintaining a high energy level while gh replacement therapy has been proposed to treat depression as a result of gh deficiency , the long-term effects of such therapy are unknown gh in humans appears to improve cognitive function and may be useful in the treatment of patients with cognitive impairment that is a result of gh deficiency gh can be used to treat conditions that produce short stature but are not related to deficiencies in gh however , results are not as dramatic when compared to short stature that is solely attributable to deficiency of gh examples of other causes of shortness often treated with gh are turner syndrome , chronic kidney failure , praderâ€“willi syndrome , intrauterine growth restriction , and severe idiopathic short stature gh has also been used experimentally in patients with short bowel syndrome to lessen the requirement for intravenous total parenteral nutrition athletes in many sports have used human growth hormone in order to attempt to enhance their athletic performance in 1985 , biosynthetic human growth hormone replaced pituitary-derived human growth hormone for therapeutic use in the u.s
