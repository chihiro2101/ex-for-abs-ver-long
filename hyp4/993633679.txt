in asimov 's writings the endochronicity of thiotimoline is explained by the fact that in the thiotimoline molecule , there is at least one carbon atom such that , while two of the carbon 's four chemical bonds lie in normal spacetime , one of the bonds projects into the future and another into the past in 1947 asimov was engaged in doctoral research in chemistry and , as part of his experimental procedure , he needed to dissolve catechol in water as he observed the crystals dissolve as soon as they hit the water 's surface , it occurred to him that if catechol were any more soluble , then it would dissolve before it encountered the water by that time asimov had been writing professionally for nine years and would soon write a doctoral dissertation asimov wrote the article on 8 june 1947 , but was uncertain as to whether the resulting work of fiction was publishable the article made asimov famous for the first time outside science fiction , as chemists shared copies of the article in 1952 , asimov wrote a second spoof scientific paper on thiotimoline called '' the micropsychiatric applications of thiotimoline '' according to the second article , thiotimoline 's time of solubility varies depending on the determination of the person adding the water the first two thiotimoline '' articles '' appeared together in asimov 's first collection of science essays , only a trillion ( 1957 ) , under the joint title '' the marvellous properties of thiotimoline '' asimov also included the original article in his 1972 collection the early asimov asimov wrote a third thiotimoline article on 14 november 1959 called '' thiotimoline and the space age '' finally , asimov describes attempts to create a '' heisenberg failure '' , to get a sample of thiotimoline to dissolve without later adding water to it asimov speculated that noah 's flood might have been brought about by thiotimoline experiments among the ancient sumerians asimov 's final piece on thiotimoline was a short story titled '' thiotimoline to the stars '' , which he wrote for harry harrison 's astounding ( 1973 ) a research note can be found in one location which makes reference to '' thiomotilene crystals '' and their '' endochronic properties '' , which in turn strongly suggests motilene 's name be derived from thiotimoline
