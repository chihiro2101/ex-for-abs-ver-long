earthshine is visible earthlight reflected from the moon 's night side it is also known as the moon 's ashen glow or as '' the new moon with the old moon in her arm '' when the lunar phase is new as viewed from earth , earth would appear nearly fully sunlit from the moon sunlight is reflected from earth to the night side of the moon light is reflected from earth to the moon and back to earth as earthshine thus , the part of earth where it is daytime and from where the moon is visible determines how bright the earthshine on the moon appears at any given time studies of earthshine can be used to show how the earth 's cloud cover varies over time for example , when its phase is full , the moon reflects light preferentially toward the sun and also earth , which is in almost the same direction as viewed from earth , the full moon therefore opposition surge than it would if it scattered light uniformly in all directions tpf would detect light reflected by planets orbiting stars to investigate whether they could harbor life in preparation for these missions , astronomers have performed detailed earthshine observations , since earthshine has the spectroscopic characteristics of light reflected by the earth
