the factory method design pattern is used instead of the regular class constructor for keeping within the solid principles of programming , decoupling the construction of objects from the objects themselves the vehicle constructor code then calls a motor factory method , to create the desired motor that complies with the imotor interface this can be accomplished by constructing the subclasses with a vehicle factory method , while supplying the motor type creating an object directly within the class that requires or uses the object is inflexible because it commits the class to a particular object and makes it impossible to change the instantiation independently of the class the factory method design pattern is used by first defining a separate operation , a factory method , for creating an object , and then using this factory method by calling it to create the object the factory method lets a class defer instantiation it uses to subclasses the factory method pattern relies on inheritance , as object creation is delegated to subclasses that implement the factory method to create objects none in the above uml class diagram , the creator class that requires a product object does n't instantiate the product1 class directly
