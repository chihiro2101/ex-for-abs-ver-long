the main organs involved in urination are the urinary bladder and the urethra the smooth muscle of the bladder , known as the detrusor , is innervated by sympathetic nervous system fibers from the lumbar spinal cord and parasympathetic fibers from the sacrum spinal cord fibers in the pelvic nerves constitute the main afferent limb of the voiding reflex ; the parasympathetic fibers to the bladder that constitute the excitatory efferent limb also travel in these nerves part of the urethra is surrounded by the male or female external urethral sphincter , which is innervated by the somatic pudendal nerve originating in the cord , in an area termed onuf 's nucleus smooth muscle bundles pass on either side of the urethra , and these fibers are sometimes called the internal urethral sphincter , although they do not encircle the urethra further along the urethra is a sphincter of skeletal muscle , the sphincter of the membranous urethra ( external urethral sphincter ) in healthy individuals , the lower urinary tract has two discrete phases of activity : the storage ( or guarding ) phase , when urine is stored in the bladder ; and the voiding phase , when urine is released through the urethra the state of the reflex system is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra at low bladder volumes , afferent firing is low , resulting in excitation of the outlet ( the sphincter and urethra ) , and relaxation of the bladder at high bladder volumes , afferent firing increases , causing a conscious sensation of urinary urge when the individual is ready to urinate , he or she consciously initiates voiding , causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax voiding continues until the bladder empties completely , at which point the bladder relaxes and the outlet contracts to re-initiate storage during micturition , parasympathetic stimulation causes the detrusor muscle to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to relax in the adult , the volume of urine in the bladder that normally initiates a reflex contraction is about during storage , bladder pressure stays low , because of the bladder 's highly compliant nature a plot of bladder ( intravesical ) pressure against the depressant of fluid in the bladder ( called a cystometrogram ) , will show a very slight rise as the bladder is filled the bladder 's smooth muscle has some inherent contractile activity ; however , when its nerve supply is intact , stretch receptors in the bladder wall initiate a reflex contraction that has a lower threshold than the inherent contractile response of the muscle action potentials carried by sensory neurons from stretch receptors in the urinary bladder wall travel to the sacral segments of the spinal cord through the pelvic nerves since bladder wall stretch is low during the storage phase , these afferent neurons fire at low frequencies low-frequency afferent signals cause relaxation of the bladder by inhibiting sacral parasympathetic preganglionic neurons and exciting lumbar sympathetic preganglionic neurons conversely , afferent input causes contraction of the sphincter through excitation of onuf 's nucleus , and contraction of the bladder neck and urethra through excitation of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons diuresis ( production of urine by the kidney ) occurs constantly , and as the bladder becomes full , afferent firing increases , yet the micturition reflex can be voluntarily inhibited until it is appropriate to begin voiding voiding begins when a voluntary signal is sent from the brain to begin urination , and continues until the bladder is empty bladder afferent signals ascend the spinal cord to the periaqueductal gray , where they project both to the pontine micturition center and to the cerebrum the firing of these neurons causes the wall of the bladder to contract ; as a result , a sudden , sharp rise in intravesical pressure occurs the pontine micturition center also causes inhibition of onuf 's nucleus , resulting in relaxation of the external urinary sphincter when the external urinary sphincter is relaxed urine is released from the urinary bladder when the pressure there is great enough to force urine to flow out of the urethra the flow of urine through the urethra has an overall excitatory role in micturition , which helps sustain voiding until the bladder is empty elsevier after urination , the female urethra empties partially by gravity , with assistance from muscles the posited benefits of faster voiding are decreased risk of predation ( while voiding ) and decreased risk of urinary tract infection another possibility is the excitation or disinhibition of neurons in the pontine micturition center , which causes concurrent contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the sphincter after transection of the brain stem just above the pons , the threshold is lowered and less bladder filling is required to trigger it , whereas after transection at the top of the midbrain , the threshold for the reflex is essentially normal however , stimulation experiments in animals indicate that other cortical areas also affect the process voluntary contraction of the abdominal muscles aids the expulsion of urine by increasing the pressure applied to the urinary bladder wall , but voiding can be initiated without straining even when the bladder is nearly empty the external sphincter can be contracted voluntarily , which will prevent urine from passing down the urethra in females the need to urinate is felt in the lower abdomen region when the bladder is full when the bladder becomes too full , the sphincter muscles will involuntarily relax , allowing urine to pass from the bladder the bladder becomes shrunken and the bladder wall hypertrophied the reason for the difference between the small , hypertrophic bladder seen in this condition and the distended , hypotonic bladder seen when only the afferent nerves are interrupted is not known the hyperactive state in the former condition suggests the development of denervation hypersensitization even though the neurons interrupted are preganglionic rather than postganglionic this type of bladder is sometimes called the spastic neurogenic bladder due to the positions where the urethra exits the body , males and females often use different techniques for urination elderly males with prostate gland enlargement may benefit from sitting down while in healthy males , no difference is found in the ability to urinate for practising muslim men , the genital modesty of squatting is also associated with proper cleanliness requirements or awrah it is also possible for females to urinate while standing , and while clothed an alternative method for women to urinate standing is to use a tool known as a female urination device to assist sometimes urination is done in a container such as a bottle , urinal , bedpan , or chamber pot ( also known as a gazunder ) a container or wearable urine collection device may be used so that the urine can be examined for medical reasons or for a drug test , for a bedridden patient , when no toilet is available , or there is no other possibility to dispose of the urine immediately females usually sit or squat for urination , depending on what type of toilet they use : a squat toilet is used for urination in a squatting position urine may be consumed , or the person may bathe in it female kob may exhibit urolagnia during sex ; one female will urinate while the other sticks her nose in the stream to identify their territories , male tigers mark trees by spraying urine and anal gland secretions , as well as marking trails with scat
