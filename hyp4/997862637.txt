radio clocks synchronized to a terrestrial time signal can usually achieve an accuracy within a hundredth of a second relative to the time standard , generally limited by uncertainties and variability in radio propagation some timekeepers , particularly watches such as some casio wave ceptors which are more likely than desk clocks to be used when travelling , can synchronise to any one of several different time signals transmitted in different regions radio clocks depend on coded time signals from radio stations the stations vary in broadcast frequency , in geographic location , and in how the signal is modulated to identify the current time list of radio time signal stations a number of manufacturers and retailers sell radio clocks that receive coded time signals from a radio station , which , in turn , derives the time from a true atomic clock one of the first radio clocks was offered by heathkit in late 1983 this oscillator was disciplined , meaning that the microprocessor-based clock used the highly accurate time signal received from wwv to trim the crystal oscillator ; digital terrestrial television : the dvb and atsc standards have 2 packet types that send time and date information to the receiver ; vhf fm radio data system : rds can send a clock signal with sub-second precision but with an accuracy no greater than 100 ms and with no indication of clock stratum not all rds networks or stations using rds send accurate time signals gps , galileo and glonass satellite navigation systems have one or more caesium , rubidium or hydrogen maser atomic clocks on each satellite , referenced to a clock or clocks on the ground many modern radio clocks use the global positioning system to provide more accurate time than can be obtained from terrestrial radio stations casio wave ceptor clock network speaking clock time from npl time transfer time synchronization in north america
