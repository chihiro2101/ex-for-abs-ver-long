the radio church of god began with herbert w armstrong , who in 1931 was ordained by the oregon conference of the church of god ( seventh-day ) , an adventist group , and began serving a congregation in eugene , oregon on january 7 , 1934 , armstrong began hosting a broadcast on a local 100-watt radio station kore in eugene it was essentially a condensed church service on the air , with hymn singing featured along with armstrong 's message , and it was the launching point for what would become the radio church of god to facilitate the work of the growing church , he incorporated it on march 3 , 1946 , as the radio church of god in 1947 , ambassador college was founded in pasadena by the church , and the campus served as the church 's headquarters in 1956 , armstrong published the booklet 1975 in prophecy ! , which predicted an upcoming nuclear war and subsequent enslavement of mankind , leading to the second coming he explained that the book was written to contrast the spiritual condition of the world with the modern inventions that scientists were promising for the year 1975 because of his strong emphasis on these prophetic dates , the church grew quickly in the late 1960s and , on january 5 , 1968 , was renamed the worldwide church of god while church members were told at the time that the reason was ted armstrong 's opposition to some of his father 's teachings , ted armstrong later admitted that the actual reason was his relationships with many women herbert armstrong , who resumed the broadcasting duties of the world tomorrow program , did not reconcile with ted before his death he explained that those '' called '' by god , who believed the gospel of the kingdom , and received god 's spirit upon full-immersion baptism , became part of the true , biblical , 'church of god ' ministers had the duty of responsibility to disfellowship any in their congregations who caused trouble or division every third year , members gave an additional tithe to help '' widows and orphans '' of the church seven high holy days were celebrated throughout the year , on which members gave offerings in baskets passed church headquarters and the former , beautiful , ambassador college , were located in pasadena , california , on prime real estate walls in the outer lobby were made of a rare pink onyx , and beautiful candelabras and chandeliers were on display , including two that had been owned by the shah of iran , hung from the gilt ceilings inside the concert hall , acoustically-designed side walls were made of rosewood these factions survived well past herbert armstrong 's death in 1986 , most retaining the name church of god because armstrong had pointed out that this is the name god calls his church in the bible when the fall of 1972 came and the time to flee to a place of safety did not occur , there was yet another exodus of members who had had expectations yet became disillusioned during the 1960s , '' armstrong had sought to put into stronger action what he later termed god â€™ s way of give '' thus , the church began to cut back on its funding eventually , because the aicf was perceived to have strayed from its original goals , it was discontinued by armstrong and its assets were sold to other interests many members were disappointed that the events predicted in biblical prophecy , expounded and preached about by herbert armstrong , had not yet come to pass most were unaware that herbert armstrong had been preaching about revelation and bible prophecy on the radio as far back as world war ii he had also read a quote from winston churchill proposing the creation of a united states of europe some ( such as gerald waterhouse ) presented detailed , step-by-step accounts of the second coming in their sermons , which included armstrong himself as one of two witnesses of the book of revelation while garner ted armstrong was removed , stanley rader was orchestrating the church 's involvement in a number of corporations which rader and herbert w rader characterized his involvement as that of an adviser and claimed that his advice was opening doors for armstrong that a strict theological role would not have allowed for herbert armstrong claimed that he did not approve of the establishment of the aicf , which rader set up ostensibly to give the elder armstrong a role as the '' ambassador for world peace without portfolio '' despite the scandals of 1972 , the church continued to grow in the 1970s , with herbert armstrong still at the helm while armstrong recuperated in his home in arizona , he administered and guided church affairs through stanley rader and the church administration garner ted armstrong began his own church in 1978 in tyler , texas , after the rivalry between the younger armstrong and stanley rader intensified armstrong started giving more responsibilities to stanley rader this action was infuriating to the younger armstrong , who thought it his birthright to take over as the leader of the church in 1978 , after a failed attempt to seize control of the church from the elder armstrong , garner ted armstrong was disfellowshipped a final time about this time the gap between father and son was set when garner ted threatened to expose the secret of herbert 's molesting his sister in the later 1930s garner ted armstrong blamed stanley rader for his two-time ousting from his father 's church the state of california went through the church 's records armstrong , stanley rader , or the worldwide church of god the california second court of appeals overturned the decision on procedural grounds and added as dicta , '' we are of the opinion that the underlying action i.e , the state-imposed receivership and its attendant provisional remedy of receivership were from the inception constitutionally infirm and predestined to failure '' stanley rader left his positions within the church in 1981 some senior pastors are responsible for a single local church , but many are responsible for working in two or more churches worldwide church of god organizational splits resulted in the establishment of the global church of god , the living church
