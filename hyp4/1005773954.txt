the investigation of the nucleus was done by three optical spectrometers , one microwave radio antenna and one radar : alice ( an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ) the ultraviolet spectroscopy searched for and quantified the noble gas content in the comet nucleus , from which the temperature during the comet creation could be estimated the detection was done by an array of potassium bromide and caesium iodide photocathodes development and construction of the instrument was led by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) the visible and ir spectrometer was able to make pictures of the nucleus in the ir and also search for ir spectra of molecules in the coma the detection was done by a mercury cadmium telluride array for ir and with a ccd chip for the visible spectrum range the instrument was produced in italy , and improved versions were used for dawn and venus express miro ( microwave instrument for the rosetta orbiter ) the radio antenna along with the rest of the instrument was built by nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory with international contributions by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) , among others consert ( comet nucleus sounding experiment by radiowave transmission ) the consert experiment provided information about the deep interior of the comet using radar the radar performed tomography of the nucleus by measuring electromagnetic wave propagation between the philae lander and the rosetta orbiter through the comet nucleus rsi made use of the probe 's communication system for physical investigation of the nucleus and the inner coma of the comet the instrument consisted of a double-focus sector instrument ( dfms ) and a reflectron type time of flight ( rtof ) the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) has contributed to the deveplopment and construction of the instrument the cosima team is led by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps , germany ) ; amino acids upon landing on the comet , philae should have also tested some hypotheses as to why essential amino acids are almost all '' left-handed '' , which refers to how the atoms arrange in orientation in relation to the carbon core of the molecule they conjectured that when spiralling radiation is generated from a supernova , the circular polarisation of that radiation could then destroy one type of '' handed '' molecules the mission has yielded a significant science return , collecting a wealth of data from the nucleus and its environment at various levels of cometary activity preliminary analyses strongly suggest the carbon is present as polyaromatic organic solids mixed with sulfides and iron-nickel alloys in turn , the philae lander 's cosac instrument detected organic molecules in the comet 's atmosphere as it descended to its surface 8 november – catalina sky survey briefly misidentified the rosetta spacecraft , approaching for its second earth flyby , as a newly discovered asteroid 14 july – the osiris on-board imaging system returned images of comet 67p which confirmed the irregular shape of the comet canonically , rosetta and philae are depicted as siblings , with rosetta being the older sister , inspired by the spacecraft 's feminine name , of philae , her younger brother file : chasing a comet - the rosetta mission.webm about rosetta mission ( 9 min , 1080p hd , english ) file : landing on a comet - the rosetta mission.webm about philae landing ( 10 min
