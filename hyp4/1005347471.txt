al ( oh ) 3 is built up of double layers of hydroxyl groups with aluminium ions occupying two-thirds of the octahedral holes between the two layers all feature layers of octahedron aluminium hydroxide units , with hydrogen bonds between the layers nonetheless , both gibbsite and hydrargillite refer to the same polymorphism of aluminium hydroxide , with gibbsite used most commonly in the united states and hydrargillite used more often in europe aluminium hydroxide is amphoteric virtually all the aluminium hydroxide used commercially is manufactured by the bayer process which involves dissolving bauxite in sodium hydroxide at temperatures up to the waste solid , bauxite tailings , is removed and aluminium hydroxide is precipitated from the remaining solution of sodium aluminate this aluminium hydroxide can be converted to aluminium oxide or alumina by calcination aluminium hydroxide also finds use as a fire retardant filler for polymer applications freshly precipitated aluminium hydroxide forms gels , which are the basis for the application of aluminium salts as flocculants in water purification it reacts with excess acid in the stomach , reducing the acidity of the stomach content , which may relieve the symptoms of ulcers , heartburn or dyspepsia
