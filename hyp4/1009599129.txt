the word tsetse means '' fly '' in tswana , a bantu language of southern africa recently , tsetse without the fly has become more common in english , particularly in the scientific and development communities tsetse flies can be seen as independent individuals in three forms : as third-instar larvae , pupae and as adults tsetse first become separate from their mothers during the third larval instar , during which they have the typical appearance of maggots within the puparial shell , tsetse complete the last two larval instars and the pupal stage at the end of the pupal stage , tsetse emerge as adult flies tsetse have large heads , distinctly separated eyes , and unusual antennae the trypanosomes infectious to animals and not to humans were named trypanosoma brucei brucei procyclins are proteins developed in the surface coating of trypanosomes whilst in their tsetse fly vector the tsetse fly vector ranges mostly in the central part of africa trypanosomiasis poses a considerable constraint on livestock agricultural development in tsetse fly infested areas of sub saharan africa , especially in west and central africa the conquest of sleeping sickness and nagana would be of immense benefit to rural development and contribute to poverty alleviation and improved food security in sub-saharan africa economic guidelines for strategic planning of tsetse and trypanosomiasis control in west africa , by a.p.m the disease can be managed by controlling the vector and thus reducing the incidence of the disease by disrupting the transmission cycle another tactic to manage the disease is to target the disease directly using surveillance and curative or prophylactic treatments to reduce the number of hosts that carry the disease area-wide interventions against the tsetse and trypanosomosis problem appear more efficient and profitable if sufficiently large areas , with high numbers of cattle , can be covered to ensure sustainability of the results , it is critical to apply the control tactics on an area-wide basis , i.e targeting an entire tsetse population that is preferably genetic isolation one early technique involved slaughtering all the wild animals tsetse fed on while the fly eventually re-invaded in the 1950s , the new population of tsetse was free from the disease tsetse tend to rest on the trunks of trees so removing woody vegetation made the area inhospitable to the flies the main beneficiaries of the project are the many small holder farmers , the larger commercial farms and the consumers of meat and milk a '' tsetse suitability index '' was developed from insect population growth , climate and geospatial data to simulate the fly 's population steady state one conventional argument is that the tsetse fly made it difficult to use draught animals . resistance of tsetse flies to trypanosome infection
