phonemes and morphemes , the second paradigm 's unit of analysis was the '' speech event '' hymes also pioneered a linguistic anthropological approach to ethnopoetics hymes had hoped that this paradigm would link linguistic anthropology more to anthropology '' verbal art as performance . third paradigm : anthropological issues studied via linguistic methods and data the third paradigm , which began in the late 1980s , refocused on anthropology by providing a linguistic approach to anthropological issues rather than focusing on exploring language , third paradigm anthropologists focus on studying culture with linguistic tools contemporary linguistic anthropology continues research in all three of the paradigms described above : documentation of languages , study of language through context , and study of identity through linguistic means the third paradigm , the study of anthropological issues , is a particularly rich area of study for current linguistic anthropologists a great
