researchers trace the origins of the blade back to the domestic sickle and the prehistoric bent stick used for hunting and later in hand-to-hand combat the kukri came to be known to the western world when the east india company came into conflict with the growing gorkha kingdom , culminating in the gurkha war of 1814â€“1816 all gurkha troops are issued with two kukris , a service no.1 ( ceremonial ) and a service no.2 ( exercise ) ; in modern times members of the brigade of gurkhas receive training in its use the notion of the gurkha with his kukri carried on through to the falklands war there are substantial variations in dimensions and blade thickness depending on intended tasks as well as the region of origin and the smith that produced it as a general guide the spines vary from at the handle , and can taper to by the point while the blade lengths can vary from for general use kukri blades usually have a notch ( karda , kauda , gaudi , kaura , or cho ) at the base of the blade the notch may also be used as a catch , to hold tight against a belt , or to bite onto twine to be suspended the traditional handle attachment in nepal is the partial tang , although the more modern versions have the stick tang which has become popular the tang of the blade usually extends all the way through to the end of the handle ; the small portion of the tang that projects through the end of the handle are hammered flat to secure the blade kukri blades have a hard , tempered edge and a softer spine kukri handles , usually made from hardwood or buffalo horn , are often fastened with a kind of tree sap called laha ( also known as '' himalayan epoxy '' ) with a wood or horn handle , the tang may be heated and burned into the handle to ensure a tight fit , since only the section of handle which touches the blade is burned away in more modern kukri , handles of cast aluminium or brass are press-fitted to the tang ; as the hot metal cools it shrinks , locking onto the blade the wheel is made by hand from fine river sand bound by laha , the same adhesive used to affix the handle to the blade kukri scabbards are usually made of wood or metal with an animal skin or metal or wood covering the kukri is effective as a chopping weapon , due to its weight , and slashing weapon , because the curved shape creates a '' wedge '' effect which causes the blade to cut effectively and deeper because the blade bends towards the opponent , the user need not angle the wrist while executing a chopping motion while most famed from use in the military , the kukri is the most commonly used multipurpose tool in the fields and homes in nepal upper edge ( mathillo bhaag ) : spine of the scabbard where holding should be done when handling a kukri despite the classification of eastern and western , both styles of kukri appear to be used in all areas of nepal this khukuri is modelled on the real khukuri used by the gorkhali general
