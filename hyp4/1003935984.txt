in questionnaire surveys , 35–50 % of women report that they have at some time experienced the gushing of fluid during orgasm for instance kratochvíl ( 1994 ) surveyed 200 women and found that 6 % reported ejaculating , an additional 13 % had some experience and about 60 % reported release of fluid without actual gushing reports on the volume of fluid expelled vary considerably , starting from amounts that would be imperceptible to a woman , to mean values of 1–5 ml the suggestion that women can expel fluid from their genital area as part of sexual arousal has been described by women 's health writer rebecca chalker as '' one of the most hotly debated questions in modern sexology '' female ejaculation has been discussed in anatomical , medical , and biological literature throughout recorded history the reasons for the interest in female ejaculation have been questioned by feminist writers in the 16th century , the dutch physician laevinius lemnius , referred to how a woman '' draws forth the man 's seed and casts her own with it '' harvard , cambridge 1990 vii in the 17th century , françois mauriceau described glands at the female urethral meatus that '' pour out great quantities of saline liquor during coition , which increases the heat and enjoyment of women '' one sex two sex theory this century saw an increasing understanding of female sexual anatomy and function , in particular the work of the bartholin family in denmark in the 17th century , the dutch anatomist reinier de graaf wrote an influential treatise on the reproductive organs concerning the generative organs of women which is much cited in the literature on this topic krafft-ebing 's study of sexual perversion , psychopathia sexualis ( 1886 ) , describes female ejaculation under the heading '' congenital sexual inversion in women '' as a perversion related to neurasthenia and homosexuality ) stein and day , ny 1965 , at 265 it is also described by freud in pathological terms in his study of dora ( 1905 ) , where he relates it to hysteria thus we find almeda sperry writing to emma goldman in 1918 , about the '' rhythmic spurt of your love juices '' female ejaculation is mentioned as normal in early 20th century 'marriage manuals ' , such as th van de velde 's ideal marriage : its physiology and technique ( 1926 ) the detailed anatomy of the paraurethral ducts in the adult human female '' american journal of obstetrics and gynecology 55 : 86–101 , 1948 a more definitive contemporary account of ejaculation appeared shortly after , in 1950 , with the publication of an essay by gräfenberg based on his observations of women during orgasm however this paper made little impact , and was dismissed in the major sexological writings of that time , such as kinsey ( 1953 ) kinsey , a.c although clearly kinsey was familiar with the phenomenon , commenting that ( p late 20th century awareness this latter paper , which traces the history of the controversies to that point , and a series of three papers in 1981 by beverly whipple and colleagues in the journal of sex research , became the focal point of the current debate personal communication , cited by chalker 2000 p.125 as sevely and bennett point out , this is '' not new knowledge , but a rediscovery of lost awareness that should contribute towards reshaping our view of female sexuality '' as she observes , the female perineal urethra is embedded in the anterior vaginal wall and is surrounded by erectile tissue in all directions except posteriorly where it relates to the vaginal wall female ejaculation appears in 20th-century anthropology works , such as malinowski 's melanesian study , the sexual life of savages ( 1929 ) , and gladwin and sarason 's '' truk : man in paradise '' ( 1956 ) malinowski states that in the language of the trobriand island people , a single word is used to describe ejaculation in both male and female there have been few studies on female ejaculation research has used highly selected individuals , case studies , or very small numbers of subjects , making generalization difficult stated that '' many individuals refer to any fluid expressed from the vagina or urethra during coitus as female ejaculate , which leads to significant confusion in the literature since the area of interest is para-urethral glands , it is impossible to completely separate the secretions from urine , especially considering that there may be retrograde ejaculation into the urethra towards the bladder research has attempted to use chemicals that are excreted in the urine so that any urinary contamination can be detected the function of female ejaculation , however , remains unclear towards the later part of the 20th century , there was significant confusion between female ejaculation and coital incontinence one study by gary schubach used urethral catheterization in order to separate urine from orgasmic expulsions from elsewhere in the body seven women claiming to have ejaculations expelled large volumes of urine through the catheter at orgasm , and little to no other fluid it is also important for physicians to distinguish orgasmic ejaculation from vaginal discharges which may require further investigation and treatment in individual cases , the exact source of any reported discharge may not be obvious without further investigation critics have maintained that ejaculation is either stress incontinence or vaginal lubrication early work was contradictory ; the initial study on one woman by addiego and colleagues , reported in 1981 , could not be confirmed in a subsequent study on 11 women in 1983 , but was confirmed in another 7 women in 1984 belzer showed that in one woman he studied , the dye was found in her urine , but not her orgasmic expulsion in 1984 , the journal of sex research described the debate surrounding female ejaculation as 'heated' the presence of chemical markers such as psa or pap in the female genital tract has been considered evidence in rape trials , sensabaugh gf , kahane d female ejaculation the double standard in the bedroom by eric jackson , 2008/09/22 the-clitoris.com : female ejaculation & the g-spot :
