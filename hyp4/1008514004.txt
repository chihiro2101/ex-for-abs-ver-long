macrophages that reside in adult healthy tissues either derive from circulating monocytes or are established before birth and then maintained during adult life independently of monocytes by contrast , most of the macrophages that accumulate at diseased sites typically derive from circulating monocytes when a monocyte enters damaged tissue through the endothelium of a blood vessel , a process known as leukocyte extravasation , it undergoes a series of changes to become a macrophage monocytes are attracted to a damaged site by chemical substances through chemotaxis , triggered by a range of stimuli including damaged cells , pathogens and cytokines released by macrophages already at the site unlike short-lived neutrophils , macrophages survive longer in the body , up to several months file : phagocytosis zp.svg thumb right 400px steps of a macrophage ingesting a pathogen : a macrophages are professional phagocytes and are highly specialized in removal of dying or dead cells and cellular debris this role is important in chronic inflammation , as the early stages of inflammation are dominated by neutrophils , which are ingested by macrophages if they come of age ( see cd31 for a description of this process ) when at the site , the first wave of neutrophils , after the process of aging and after the first 48 hours , stimulate the appearance of the macrophages whereby these macrophages will then ingest the aged neutrophils typhoidal salmonellae induce their own phagocytosis by host macrophages in vivo , and inhibit digestion by lysosomal action , thereby using macrophages for their own replication and causing macrophage apoptosis macrophages are versatile cells that play many roles as secretory cells , monocytes and macrophages are vital to the regulation of immune responses and the development of inflammation ; they produce a wide array of powerful chemical substances ( monokines ) including enzymes , complement proteins , and regulatory factors such as interleukin-1 at the same time , they carry receptors for lymphokines that allow them to be '' activated '' into single-minded pursuit of microbes and tumour cells in some cases , pathogens are very resistant to adhesion by the macrophages the antigen presentation on the surface of infected macrophages ( in the context of mhc class ii ) in a lymph node stimulates th1 ( type 1 helper t cells ) to proliferate ( mainly due to il-12 secretion from the macrophage ) macrophages provide yet another line of defense against tumor cells and somatic cells infected with fungus or parasites m1 macrophages : as mentioned earlier ( previously referred to as classically activated macrophages ) , m1 '' killer '' macrophages are activated by lps and ifn-gamma , and secrete high levels of il-12 and low levels of il-10 m1 macrophages have pro-inflammatory , bactericidal , and phagocytic functions m2 is the phenotype of resident tissue macrophages , and can be further elevated by il-4 m2 macrophages produce high levels of il-10 , tgf-beta and low levels of il-12 these mediator molecules create a pro-inflammatory response that in return produce pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 and tnf unlike m1 macrophages , m2 macrophages secrete an anti-inflammatory response via the addition of interleukin-4 or interleukin-13 with a lack of these growth factors/anti-inflammatory cytokines and an overabundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines from m1 macrophages chronic wounds are unable to heal in a timely manner normally , after neutrophils eat debris/pathogens they perform apoptosis and are removed however , dysregulation occurs as the m1 macrophages are unable/do not phagocytose neutrophils that have undergone apoptosis leading to increased macrophage migration and inflammation m2 & nbsp ; macrophages can remove cholesterol from blood vessels , but when the cholesterol is oxidized , the m2 & nbsp ; macrophages become apoptosis foam cells contributing to the atheroma of atherosclerosis these early-invading , phagocytic macrophages reach their highest concentration about 24 hours following the onset of some form of muscle cell injury or reloading attracted to the wound site by growth factors released by platelets and other cells , monocytes from the bloodstream enter the area through blood vessel walls numbers of monocytes in the wound peak one to one and a half days after the injury occurs scientists have elucidated that as well as eating up material debris , macrophages are involved in the typical limb regeneration in the salamander as described above , macrophages play a key role in removing dying or dead cells and cellular debris macrophages will also engulf macromolecules , and so play a key role in the pharmacokinetics of parenteral irons every tissue harbors its own specialized population of resident macrophages , which entertain reciprocal interconnections with the stroma and functional tissue infection of macrophages in joints is associated with local inflammation during and after the acute phase of chikungunya ( caused by chikv or chikungunya virus ) macrophages can contribute to tumor growth and progression by promoting tumor cell proliferation and invasion , fostering tumor angiogenesis and suppressing antitumor immune cells in an obese individual some adipocytes burst and undergo necrotic death , which causes the residential m2 macrophages to switch to m1 phenotype though very similar in structure to tissue macrophages , intestinal macrophages have evolved specific characteristics and functions given their natural environment , which is in the digestive tract there is no drop off in phagocytosis efficiency as intestinal macrophages are able to effectively phagocytize the bacteria , s there has yet to be a determined mechanism for the alteration of the intestinal macrophages by recruitment of new monocytes or changes in the already present intestinal macrophages
