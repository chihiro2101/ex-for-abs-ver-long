the mistle thrush was first described by carl linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of systema naturae under its current scientific name turdus is the latin for '' thrush '' , and viscivorus , '' mistletoe eater '' , comes from viscum '' mistletoe '' and vorare , '' to devour '' the bird 's liking for mistletoe berries is also indicated by its english name , '' mistle '' being an old name for the plant there are more than 60 species of medium to large thrushes in the genus turdus , characterised by rounded heads , longish pointed wings , and usually melodious songs at least eight subspecies have been proposed , but the differences between them are mainly clinal , with birds being paler and less densely spotted in the east of the range mistle thrush fossils have been found in pleistocene deposits from poland and sicily the mistle thrush is the largest thrush native to europe the nominate subspecies measures in length , with a wingspan birds of intermediate appearance are seen west of the ob river where the range overlaps with viscivorus deichleri resembles bonapartei in appearance , but is closer in size to the nominate viscivorus , although it has a more slender bill adults have a full moult after breeding , beginning between late may and the end of june , and completed by early october the mistle thrush is much larger , paler and longer-tailed than the sympatric song thrush the long-tailed thrush has olive-toned upperparts , bars on its breast and two wing bars juvenile mistle thrushes are superficially similar to white 's thrush , but that species has golden-yellow plumage , scalloped underparts and a distinctive underwing pattern trureetruuruu or similar , repeated three to six times , and used to advertise his territory , attract a mate and maintain the pair bond the tone resembles that of the song thrush or blackbird , but compared to its relatives the mistle thrush 's repertoire is less varied and the delivery is slower the song is , however , much louder , often audible up to 2 & nbsp ; km ( 2,000 & nbsp ; yd ) away the main call , given by both sexes , is a dry chattering krrrr , louder when it is alarmed or excited the mistle thrush breeds in much of europe and temperate asia , although it is absent from the treeless far north , and its range becomes discontinuous in southeast europe , turkey and the middle east the mistle thrush is a partial migrant : birds from the north and east of the range wintering in the milder areas of europe and north africa in the himalayas , the breeding population moves to nearby lower-altitude sites in winter in the winter 2017/2018 the first record of a mistle thrush for north america was at miramichi in new brunswick the mistle thrush is found in a wide range of habitats containing trees , including forests , plantations , hedges and town parks breeding occurs at up to in the mountains of north africa , and occasionally much higher , to perhaps the most notable find of the 118th christmas bird count in canada was a single vagrant mistle thrush found in miramichi , new brunswick the discovery attracted many birders from canada and the united states ; sightings continued from early december 2017 through late march 2018 the mistle thrush is quite terrestrial , hopping with its head held up and body erect ; when excited , it will flick its wings and tail the flight consists of undulating bounds interspersed with glides their territories are much larger than those of blackbirds or song thrushes ; although the nest territory is only about , around is used for feeding the common chaffinch often nests close to a mistle thrush , the vigilance of the chaffinch and the aggressive behaviour of the thrush benefiting both species snails are sometimes smashed on a stone '' anvil '' , a technique also used by the song thrush the highly nutritious fruits are favoured by the thrush , which digests the flesh leaving the sticky seeds to be excreted , possibly in a suitable location for germination the mistle thrush is predated upon by a wide variety of birds of prey , including the boreal owl , korpim√§ki & hakkarainen ( 2012 ) p given its high numbers and very large range , this thrush is therefore classified by the international union for conservation of nature as being of least concern the early renaissance poem '' the harmony of birds '' features a thrusshe ( mistle thrush ) singing the phrase '' sanctus , sanctus '' , distinguishing the bird from the song thrush , the mauys or throstle '' holm thrush '' , '' hollin cock '' and '' holm cock '' are based on obsolete names for the holly tree , which may be defended by the thrush in winter for its berries
