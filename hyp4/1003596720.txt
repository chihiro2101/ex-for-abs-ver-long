because of their long wavelengths , vlf radio waves can diffract around large obstacles and so are not blocked by mountain ranges , and can propagate as ground waves following the curvature of the earth and so are not limited by the horizon ground waves are less important beyond several hundred to a thousand miles , and the main mode of long distance propagation is an earth-ionosphere waveguide mechanism the earth is surrounded by a conductive layer of electrons and ions in the upper atmosphere at the bottom of the ionosphere called the d layer at 60–90 & nbsp ; km ( 37–56 & nbsp ; miles ) altitude , which reflects vlf radio waves vlf waves have very low path attenuation , 2–3 & nbsp ; db per 1,000 & nbsp ; km , with little of the '' fading '' experienced at higher frequencies : : this is because vlf waves are reflected from the bottom of the ionosphere , while higher frequency shortwave signals are returned to earth from higher layers in the ionosphere , the f1 and f2 layers , by a refraction process , and spend most of their journey in the ionosphere , so they are much more affected by ionization gradients and turbulence therefore , vlf transmissions are very stable and reliable , and are used for long distance communication however , atmospheric noise ( “ sferics ” ) is high in the band , including such phenomena as '' whistlers '' , caused by lightning vlf waves can penetrate seawater to a depth of at least 10–40 & nbsp ; meters ( 30–130 & nbsp ; feet ) , depending on the frequency employed and the salinity of the water , so they are used to communicate with submarines vertical antennas must be used because vlf waves propagate in vertical polarization , but a quarter-wave vertical antenna at 30 & nbsp ; khz ( 10 & nbsp ; km wavelength ) would be high very high power transmitters ( ~1 & nbsp ; megawatt ) are required for long distance communication , so the efficiency of the antenna is an important factor high power transmitting antennas for vlf frequencies are very large wire antennas , up to several kilometers long counterpoise systems have also been used , consisting of radial networks of copper cables supported several feet above the ground under the antenna a large loading coil is required at the antenna feed point to cancel the capacitive reactance of the antenna to make it resonant at vlf the design of this coil is challenging ; it must have low resistance at the operating rf frequency , high , and must withstand the high voltage on the antenna end the large vlf antennas used for high power transmitters usually have bandwidths of only 50-100 & nbsp ; hertz , and when transmitting frequency shift keying ( fsk ) , the usual mode , the resonant frequency of the antenna must sometimes be dynamically shifted with the modulation , between the two fsk frequencies large vlf antennas usually operate in 'voltage limited ' mode : the maximum power of the transmitter is limited by the voltage the antenna can accept without air breakdown , corona , and arcing from the antenna the bandwidth of large capacitively loaded vlf antennas is so narrow ( 50–100 & nbsp ; hz ) that even the small frequency shifts of fsk and msk modulation may exceed it , throwing the antenna out of resonance , causing the antenna to reflect some power back down the feedline the traditional solution is to use a '' bandwidth resistor '' in the antenna which reduces the , increasing the bandwidth ; however this also reduces the power output a recent alternative used in some military vlf transmitters is a circuit which dynamically shifts the antenna 's resonant frequency between the two output frequencies with the modulation so when the frequency of the transmitter is shifted between the ' 1 ' and ' 0 ' frequencies , the saturable reactor changes the inductance in the antenna resonant circuit to shift the antenna resonant frequency to follow the transmitter 's frequency the requirements for receiving antennas are less stringent , because of the high level of natural atmospheric noise in the band in military networks frequency shift keying ( fsk ) modulation is used to transmit radioteletype data using 5 & nbsp ; bit ita2 or 8 & nbsp ; bit ascii character codes for example , a frequency of 9070 & nbsp ; hz might be used to indicate a ' 1 ' and the frequency 9020 & nbsp ; hz , 50 & nbsp ; hz lower , to indicate a ' 0 ' if the two frequencies representing ' 1 ' and ' 0 ' are 50 & nbsp ; hz apart , the standard frequency shift used in military vlf stations , their phases coincide every 20 & nbsp ; ms operations tend to congregate around the frequencies 8.27 & nbsp ; khz , 6.47 & nbsp ;
