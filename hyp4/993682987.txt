recursion theory originated in the 1930s , with work of kurt gödel , alonzo church , rózsa péter , alan turing , stephen kleene , and emil post these results led stephen kleene ( 1952 ) to coin the two names '' church 's thesis '' ( kleene 1952:300 ) and '' turing 's thesis '' ( kleene 1952:376 ) nowadays these are often considered as a single hypothesis , the church–turing thesis , which states that any function that is computable by an algorithm is a computable function both reprintings have the following footnote added to the davis volume by gödel in 1965 : '' to be more precise : a function of integers is computable in any formal system containing arithmetic if and only if it is computable in arithmetic , where a function f is called computable in s if there is in s a computable term representing f ( p the list of undecidable problems gives additional examples of problems with no computable solution a set of natural numbers is said to be a computable set ( also called a decidable , recursive , or turing computable set ) if there is a turing machine that , given a number n , halts with output 1 if n is in the set and halts with output 0 if n is not in the set a function f from the natural numbers to themselves is a recursive or ( turing ) computable function if there is a turing machine that , on input n , halts and returns output f ( n ) the use of turing machines here is not necessary ; there are many other model of computation that have the same computing power as turing machines ; for example the mu-recursive function obtained from primitive recursion and the μ operator the definition in terms of μ-recursive functions as well as a different definition of rekursiv functions by gödel led to the traditional name recursive for sets and functions computable by a turing machine in contemporary use , the term '' computable function '' has various definitions : according to cutland ( 1980 ) , it is a partial recursive function ( which can be undefined for some inputs ) , while according to soare ( 1987 ) it is a total recursive ( equivalently , general recursive ) function thus the halting problem is an example of a recursively enumerable set , which is a set that can be enumerated by a turing machine ( other terms for recursively enumerable include computably enumerable and semidecidable ) equivalently , a set is recursively enumerable if and only if it is the range of some computable function beginning with the theory of recursive sets and functions described above , the field of recursion theory has grown to include the study of many closely related topics recursion theory in mathematical logic has traditionally focused on relative computability , a generalization of turing computability defined using oracle turing machines , introduced by turing & nbsp ; ( 1939 ) the oracle machine may only ask questions of the form '' is n in the oracle set ? '' thus an oracle machine with a noncomputable oracle will be able to compute sets that a turing machine without an oracle can not informally , a set of natural numbers a is turing reduction to a set b if there is an oracle machine that correctly tells whether numbers are in a when run with b as the oracle set ( in this case , the set a is also said to be ( relatively ) computable from b and recursive in b ) if a set a is turing reducible to a set b and b is turing reducible to a then the sets are said to have the same turing degree ( also called degree of unsolvability ) the natural examples of sets that are not computable , including many different sets that encode variants of the halting problem , have two properties in common : they are recursively enumerable , and each can be translated into any other via a many-one reduction that is , given such sets a and b , there is a total computable function f such that a has the property that either the halting problem or its complement is many-one reducible to e , that is , can be mapped using a many-one reduction to e ( see rice 's theorem for more detail ) the program of reverse mathematics asks which set-existence axioms are necessary to prove particular theorems of mathematics in subsystems of second-order arithmetic this study was initiated by harvey friedman and was studied in detail by stephen simpson and others ; simpson ( 1999 ) gives a detailed discussion of the program the set is then constructed in stages , each stage attempting to satisfy one of more of the requirements by either adding numbers to the set or banning numbers from the set so that the final set will satisfy the requirement this branch of recursion theory analyzed the following question : for fixed m and n with 0 & nbsp ; 1 , & nbsp ; x 2 , & nbsp ; there are close relationships between the turing degree of a set of natural numbers and the difficulty ( in terms of the arithmetical hierarchy ) of defining that set using a first-order logic the fact that certain sets are computable or relatively computable often implies that these sets can be defined in weak subsystems of second order arithmetic he argues that turing 's terminology using the word '' computable '' is more natural and more widely understood than the terminology using the word '' recursive '' introduced by kleene since any two infinite computable sets are linked by a computable bijection , this proposal identifies all the infinite computable sets ( the finite computable sets are viewed as trivial ) according to rogers , the sets of interest in recursion theory are the noncomputable sets , partitioned into equivalence classes by computable bijections of the natural numbers
