quorum sensing was first reported in 1970 , by kenneth nealson , terry platt , and j because they attributed this conditioning of the medium to the growing population of cells itself , they referred to the phenomenon as autoinducer some of the best-known examples of quorum sensing come from studies of bacteria bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate certain phenotype expressions , which in turn , coordinate their behaviours certain bacteria are able to use quorum sensing to regulate bioluminescence , nitrogen fixation and spore both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria use quorum sensing , but there are some major differences in their mechanisms for the bacteria to use quorum sensing constitutively , they must possess three characteristics : to secrete a signaling molecule , an autoinducer , to detect the change in concentration of signaling molecules , and to regulate gene transcription as a response qs signaling molecules are usually secreted at a low level by individual bacteria at high cell density , the local concentration of signaling molecules may exceed its threshold level , and trigger changes in gene expression when gram-positive bacteria detect high concentration of aips in their environment , that happens by way of aips binding to a receptor to activate a kinase the kinase phosphorylates a transcription factor , which regulates gene transcription some gram-negative bacteria may use the two-component system as well fischeri cells are free-living ( or planktonic ) , the autoinducer is at low concentration , and , thus , cells do not show luminescence fischeri bioluminescence is regulated by ahls ( n-acyl-homoserine lactones ) which is a product of the luxi gene whose transcription is regulated by the luxr activator luxr works only when ahls binds to the luxr curvibacter is a gram-negative curved rod-formed bacterium which is the main colonizer of the epithelial cell surfaces of the early branching metazoan hydra vulgaris moreover , a study showed that these host associated curvibacter bacteria produce a broad spectrum of ahl , explaining the presence of those operons as mentioned before , ahl are the quorum sensing molecules of gram-negative bacteria , which means curvibacter has a quorum sensing activity therefore , bacteria have less chance to evade the immune system and to colonize host tissues this allows the bacterial metabolism to adjust itself to the host growth conditions , which is essential for the colonization of the ectodermal mucus layer of hydrae coli ) , cell division may be partially regulated by ai-2-mediated quorum sensing coli will lose the ability to internalize ai-2 ( because of catabolite repression ) coli and salmonella enterica do not produce ahl signals commonly found in other gram-negative bacteria sdia detects ahls produced by other species of bacteria including aeromonas hydrophila , hafnia alvei , and yersinia enterocolitica the opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa uses quorum sensing to coordinate the formation of biofilm , swarming motility , exopolysaccharide production , virulence , and cell aggregation recent studies have discovered that anaerobiosis can significantly impact the major regulatory circuit of quorum sensing disrupting the signaling process in this way is called quorum sensing inhibition shows both quorum sensing and quorum quenching activity it produces ahls and also , it can degrade the ahl molecules as well in 2002 , the crystal structure of the receptor luxp of vibrio harveyi with its inducer ai-2 ( which is one of the few biomolecules containing boron ) bound to it was also determined researchers have developed novel molecules which block the signalling receptors of bacteria ( '' quorum quenching '' ) mbtl is a compound that has been shown to inhibit quorum sensing and decrease the amount of cell death by a significant amount overall , the quorum sensing genes seem to have diverged along with the proteobacteria phylum as a whole this indicates that these quorum sensing systems are quite ancient , and arose very early in the proteobacteria lineage this result is in line with the observation that quorum sensing genes tend to control the expression of a wide array of genes scattered throughout the bacterial chromosome quorum quenching is the process of preventing quorum sensing by disrupting signalling as mentioned before , n-acyl-homoserine lactones ( ahl ) are the quorum sensing signaling molecules of the gram-negative bacteria several groups of social insects have been shown to use quorum sensing in a process that resembles collective decision-making the quorum sensing process in honey bees is similar to the method used by temnothorax ants in several ways quorum sensing has been engineered using synthetic biological circuits in different systems
