although usually not cost-effective , glycerol can be produced by various routes from propene this epichlorohydrin is then hydrolyzed to give glycerol chlorine-free processes from propylene include the synthesis of glycerol from acrolein and propylene oxide : because of the large-scale production of biodiesel from fats , where glycerol is a waste product , the market for glycerol is depressed owing to oversupply , efforts are being made to convert glycerol to synthetic precursors , such as acrolein and epichlorohydrin in food and beverages , glycerol serves as a humectant , solvent , and sweetener , and may help preserve foods it is also used as filler in commercially prepared low-fat foods ( e.g glycerol and water are used to preserve certain types of plant leaves as a sugar substitute , it has approximately 27 food energy per teaspoon ( sugar has 20 ) and is 60 % as sweet as sucrose as a food additive , glycerol is labeled as e number e422 due to this it is used widely in wound care products , including glycerin based hydrogel sheets for burns and other wound care glycerol is used in medical , pharmaceutical and personal care preparations , often as a means of improving smoothness , providing lubrication , and as a humectant in solid dosage forms like tablets , glycerol is used as a tablet holding agent for human consumption , glycerol is classified by the u.s glycerol is also used in blood banking to preserve red blood cells prior to freezing glycerol is a component of glycerin soap this kind of soap is used by people with sensitive , easily irritated skin because it prevents skin dryness with its moisturizer properties glycerol has also been incorporated as a component of bio-ink formulations in the field of bioprinting it is also used as an '' alcohol-free '' alternative to ethanol as a solvent in preparing herbal extractions alcohol-based tinctures can also have the alcohol removed and replaced with glycerol for its preserving properties fluid extract manufacturers often extract herbs in hot water before adding glycerol to make glycerites glycerol was historically used as an anti-freeze for automotive applications before being replaced by ethylene glycol , which has a lower freezing point reagent.co.uk glycerine is used—combined with water ( around in a 1:99 proportion ) —to create a smooth smoky environment examples ( aside from combustion of waste glycerol ) : hydrogen gas production glycerine acetate is a potential fuel additive glycerol injections can be used as a simple test for liver damage , as its rate of absorption by the liver is considered an accurate measure of liver health blood glycerol levels in diabetic patients average three times higher than healthy controls the cheaper diethylene glycol was relabeled as the more expensive glycerol
