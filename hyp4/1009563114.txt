menarche is the culmination of a series of physiological and anatomic processes of puberty : attainment of a sufficient body mass ( typically 17 % body fat ) estrogen stimulates growth and vascularity of the endometrium , the lining of the uterus no specific hormonal signal for menarche is known ; menarche as a discrete event is thought to be the relatively chance result of the gradual thickening of the endometrium induced by rising but fluctuating pubertal estrogen the initial flow of menarche is usually brighter than mature menstrual flow '' like other menses , menarche may be accompanied by abdominal pain in most girls , menarche does not mean that ovulation has occurred on the other hand , not every girl follows the typical pattern , and some girls ovulate before the first menstruation although unlikely , it is possible for a girl who has engaged in sexual intercourse shortly before her menarche to conceive and become pregnant , which would delay her menarche until after the end of the pregnancy this goes against the widely held assumption that a woman can not become pregnant until after menarche a young age at menarche is not correlated with a young age at first sexual intercourse when menarche occurs , it confirms that the girl has had a gradual estrogen-induced growth of the uterus , especially the endometrium , and that the '' outflow tract '' from the uterus , through the cervix to the vagina , is open in very rare instances , menarche may occur at an unusually early age , preceding thelarche and other signs of puberty this is termed isolated premature menarche , but other causes of vaginal bleeding must be investigated and excluded when menarche has failed to occur for more than three years after thelarche , or beyond 16 years of age , the delay is referred to as primary amenorrhea short stature , delayed growth in height and weight , and/or delayed menarche may be the only clinical manifestations of celiac disease , in absence of any other symptoms according to a review article , there may also be an association between early age at menarche and breast cancer risk studies have been conducted to observe the association of the timing of menarche with various conditions and diseases a systematic review has concluded that early age at menarche is also a risk factor for the insulin resistance condition in most of these studies menarche was specifically examined , assuming it to be a valid '' proxy '' for the more general process of puberty the more dire social conditions have been found to be associated with delay of maturation , an effect that may be compounded by dietary inadequacy this age at menarche is not much different ( 0.3 years earlier ) than that reported for u.s there are cultures that have in past centuries , and in present , practiced rites of passage for a girl experiencing menarche the mescalero apaches place high importance on their menarche ceremony and it is regarded as the most important ritual in their tribe the ulithi tribe of micronesia call a girl 's menarche kufar the girls who experience menarche wear special clothes and style their hair like the navajo goddess '' changing woman ''
