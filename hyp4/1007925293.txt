one of the symptoms of conduct disorder is a lower level of fear research performed on the impact of toddlers exposed to fear and distress shows that negative emotionality ( fear ) predicts toddlers ' empathy-related response to distress the findings support that if a caregiver is able to respond to infant cues , the toddler has a better ability to respond to fear and distress if the caregiver is able to provide therapeutic intervention teaching children at risk better empathy skills , the child will have a lower incident level of conduct disorder '' toddlers ' empathy-related responding to distress : predictions from negative emotionality and maternal behavior in infancy conduct disorder can present with limited prosocial emotions , lack of remorse or guilt , lack of empathy , lack of concern for performance , and shallow or deficient affect currently , two possible developmental courses are thought to lead to conduct disorder there is debate among professionals regarding the validity and appropriateness of diagnosing young children with conduct disorder the characteristics of the diagnosis are commonly seen in young children who are referred to mental health professionals it is also argued that some children may not in fact have conduct disorder , but are engaging in developmentally appropriate disruptive behavior the second developmental course is known as the '' adolescent-onset type '' and occurs when conduct disorder symptoms are present after the age of 10 years individuals with adolescent-onset conduct disorder exhibit less impairment than those with the childhood-onset type and are not characterized by similar psychopathology however , this argument is not established and empirical research suggests that these subgroups are not as valid as once thought in addition to these two courses that are recognized by the dsm-iv-tr , there appears to be a relationship among oppositional defiant disorder , conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder for example , some research has shown that 90 % of children diagnosed with conduct disorder had a previous diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder moreover , both disorders share relevant risk factors and disruptive behaviors , suggesting that oppositional defiant disorder is a developmental precursor and milder variant of conduct disorder in fact , only about 25 % of children with oppositional defiant disorder will receive a later diagnosis of conduct disorder correspondingly , there is an established link between conduct disorder and the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder as an adult in fact , the current diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality disorder require a conduct disorder diagnosis before the age of 15 however , again , only 25-40 % of youths with conduct disorder will develop antisocial personality disorder these developmental trajectories suggest the existence of antisocial pathways in certain individuals , which have important implications for both research and treatment children with conduct disorder have a high risk of developing other adjustment problems conduct disorder is also highly associated with both substance use and abuse children with conduct disorder have an earlier onset of substance use , as compared to their peers , and also tend to use multiple substances however , substance use disorders themselves can directly or indirectly cause conduct disorder like traits in about half of adolescents who have a substance use disorder clinical handbook of assessing and treating conduct problems in youth , 2007 ) , as is conduct disorder beyond difficulties in executive function , neurological research on youth with conduct disorder also demonstrate differences in brain anatomy and function that reflect the behaviors and mental anomalies associated in conduct disorder taken together , these findings may account for some of the variance in the psychological and behavioral patterns of youth with conduct disorder for instance , antisocial behavior suggestive of conduct disorder is associated with single parent status , parental divorce , large family size , and young age of mothers about 25-40 % of youths diagnosed with conduct disorder qualify for a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder when they reach adulthood however , among incarcerated youth or youth in juvenile detention facilities , rates of conduct disorder are between 23 % and 87 %
