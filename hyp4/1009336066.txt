here are three lists of municipalities for each one of the three regions : list of municipalities of the brussels-capital region ( 19 municipalities ) list of municipalities of the flemish region ( 300 municipalities ) list of municipalities of the walloon region ( 262 municipalities ) the municipalities with less than 5,000 inhabitants were grouped in so-called canton municipalities the number of municipalities was reduced to 2,508 when the belgian borders were recognised in 1839 , as 124 municipalities were ceded to the netherlands and another 119 municipalities became the grand duchy of luxembourg ( see the article communes of luxembourg for details ) this also includes the municipalities of the east cantons that were added to belgium following the first world war in 1961 , the so-called unitary law ; ; , of which the fourth chapter was dedicated to the territorial organisation of the municipalities , was adopted article 4 of the constitution states that each municipality must belong to only one of the four official language areas that were established in 1962â€“63 in the three officially unilingual language areas , a couple of dozen municipalities in the vicinity of another language area must provide limited facilities for speakers of that other language as only a law carried by special majorities can change the language status of any municipality , these arrangements have prevented some small municipalities with facilities to be merged in the 1970s , and thus the most minute belgian municipalities are still found in this group , notably herstappe with only 84 inhabitants ( in 2006 ) the merger of antwerp with the municipalities of berchem , borgerhout , deurne , hoboken , ekeren , merksem and wilrijk in 1983 finally reduced the number of municipalities in belgium to 589 and was the last reorganization of the municipalities for several decades because the merger of the 19 municipalities of brussels was postponed indefinitely this led 15 flemish municipalities to merge into seven , decreasing the total number of flemish municipalities from 308 to 300 the executive organ of the municipality is known as the college of mayor and aldermen ; , commonly referred to as the college of aldermen ; , in the flemish region and the brussels-capital region , and as the municipal college ; in the wallonia the three regions can amend or replace the existing legislation on the municipalities , most notably the new municipal law
