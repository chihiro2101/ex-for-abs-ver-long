the first attempt to establish an english-language newspaper in jerusalem was '' the jerusalem news '' , established in 1919 under the auspices of the christian science movement william denison mccrackan , the associated editor of both the christian science journal and christian science sentinel , was critical of the zionist slogan '' a land without a people for a people without a land '' he said , '' we used to read in our papers the slogan of zionism , 'to give back a people to a land without a people , ' while the truth was that palestine was already well-peopled with a population which was rapidly increasing from natural causes following the conquest of palestine by the british army in 1917 , christian science interested itself in the affairs of palestine , first organizing relief work and then with starting a new newspaper the jerusalem news paper was originally established in 1919 by elizabeth lippincott mcqueen , a british-american woman who would later become a women 's aeronautics pioneer , and who had in the aftermath of wwi served in war relief work in palestine under field marshal allenby there was no continuity between this short-lived paper and what would later become '' the jerusalem post '' the direct journalistic ancestry of the jerusalem post can be traced to the palestine bulletin , which was founded in january 1925 by jacob landau of the jewish telegraphic agency on 1 november 1931 , editorship of the bulletin was taken over by gershon agronsky ( later agron ) , a jewish journalist who had immigrated to palestine from the united states however , landau and agronsky instead came to an agreement to transform the bulletin into a new jointly owned newspaper accordingly , the palestine bulletin published its last issue on 30 november 1932 and the palestine post incorporating the palestine bulletin appeared the following day , 1 december 1932 during its time as the palestine post , the publication supported the struggle for a jewish homeland in palestine and openly opposed british policy restricting aliyah during the mandate period the building also contained other newspaper offices , the british press censor , the jewish settlement police , and a haganah post with a cache of weapons in 1950 , two years after the state of israel was declared , the paper was renamed the jerusalem post a number of journalists resigned from the post after black 's takeover and founded the jerusalem report , a weekly magazine eventually sold to the post jpost.com includes the '' premium zone '' , a pay-wall protected area , containing additional jerusalem post articles and special features
