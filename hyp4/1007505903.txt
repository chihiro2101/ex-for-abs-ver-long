fischer black ( 1972 ) developed another version of capm , called black capm or zero-beta capm , that does not assume the existence of a riskless asset the capm returns the asset-appropriate required return or discount rate—i.e the rate at which future cash flows produced by the asset should be discounted given that asset 's relative riskiness thus , a more risky stock will have a higher beta and will be discounted at a higher rate ; less sensitive stocks will have lower betas and be discounted at a lower rate given the accepted concave utility function , the capm is consistent with intuition—investors ( should ) require a higher return for holding a more risky asset market risk , the market as a whole , by definition , has a beta of one an investor in a large , diversified portfolio ( such as a mutual fund ) , therefore , expects performance in line with the market the risk of a portfolio comprises systematic risk , also known as undiversifiable risk , and specific risk which is also known as idiosyncratic risk or diversifiable risk unsystematic risk is the risk associated with individual assets unsystematic risk can be diversified away to smaller levels by including a greater number of assets in the portfolio ( specific risks '' average out '' ) depending on the market , a portfolio of approximately 30–40 securities in developed markets such as the uk or us will render the portfolio sufficiently diversified such that risk exposure is limited to systematic risk only a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk , as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model therefore , the required return on an asset , that is , the return that compensates for risk taken , must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context—i.e in the capm context , portfolio risk is represented by higher variance i.e the capm assumes that the risk-return profile of a portfolio can be optimized—an optimal portfolio displays the lowest possible level of risk for its level of return the traditional capm using historical data as the inputs to solve for a future return of asset i a critique of the traditional capm is that the risk measure used remains constant ( non-varying beta ) the model assumes that the variance of returns is an adequate measurement of risk capm assumes that all active and potential shareholders will consider all of their assets and optimize one portfolio the capital asset pricing model : some empirical tests , pp a final version was published in 1999 , in asset pricing and portfolio performance : models , strategy and performance metrics
