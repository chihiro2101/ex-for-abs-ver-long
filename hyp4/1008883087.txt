penfield 's job was to use geophysical data to scout possible locations for oil drilling in the offshore magnetic data , penfield noted anomalies whose depth he estimated , and mapped '' a decade earlier , the same map suggested an impact feature to contractor robert baltosser , but he was forbidden to publicize his conclusion by pemex corporate policy of the time image : chicxulub shockedquartz.png thumb penfield with the sample of shocked quartz found at well 2 , chicxulub pemex disallowed release of specific data but let penfield and company official antonio camargo present their results at the 1981 society of exploration geophysicists conference coincidentally , many experts in impact craters and the cretaceous–paleogene boundary were attending a separate conference on earth impacts this layer could have resulted from the intense heat and pressure of an earth impact , but at the time of the borings it was dismissed as a lava dome—a feature uncharacteristic of the region 's geology penfield tried to secure site samples , but was told such samples had been lost or destroyed at the same time , in 1980 , geologist walter alvarez and his father , nobel prize–winning scientist luis walter alvarez , put forth their hypothesis that a large extraterrestrial body had struck earth at the time of the cretaceous–paleogene boundary boynton published a draft earth-impact theory and sought a candidate crater thick , jumbled deposits of coarse rock fragments were also present , thought to have been scoured from one place and deposited elsewhere by a megatsunami resulting from an earth impact such deposits occur in many locations but seem concentrated in the caribbean basin at the k–pg boundary in 1990 , houston chronicle reporter carlos byars told hildebrand of penfield 's earlier discovery of a possible impact crater hildebrand contacted penfield in april 1990 and the pair soon secured two drill samples from the pemex wells , stored in new orleans more recent evidence suggests the crater is wide , and the 180 & nbsp ; km ring is an inner wall of it researchers at the university of glasgow dated tektite samples from the impact as 66,038,000 ± 11,000 & nbsp ; years old the chicxulub impactor had an estimated diameter of , and delivered an estimated energy of 21–921 & nbsp ; billion hiroshima a-bombs ( between 1.3×10 and 5.8×10 & nbsp ; joules , or 1.3–58 & nbsp ; yotta- ) the impact created a hole wide and deep , leaving a crater mainly under the sea and covered by of sediment by the 21st century in addition , the impact created winds in excess of 1000 kilometers per hour near the blast 's center the impact would have caused a megatsunami over tall that would have reached all the way to what are now texas and florida the height of the tsunami was limited by the relatively shallow sea in the area of the impact ; in deep ocean it would have been tall '' on the ground , you would feel an effect similar to an oven on broil , lasting for about an hour according to researchers , the impact triggered a seismic event equivalent to a magnitude 12 earthquake at the impact site , with shockwaves generating the equivalent of magnitude 9 earthquakes across the globe in addition , the ensuing shockwaves likely triggered large-scale volcanic eruptions across the earth ; the shockwaves probably contributed to the deccan traps flood basalt eruption , which was estimated to have occurred around the same time the emission of dust and particles could have covered the entire surface of the earth for several years , possibly a decade , creating a harsh environment for living things over a decade or longer , sunlight would have been blocked from reaching the surface of the earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere , cooling the surface dramatically ( 2001 ) suggests that net primary productivity ( npp ) rates may have increased to higher than pre-impact levels over the long term because of the high carbon dioxide concentrations in their 1991 paper , hildebrand , penfield and company described the geology and composition of the impact feature these andesitic igneous rocks were only found within the supposed impact feature , as is shocked quartz the k–pg boundary inside the feature is depressed to compared with the normal depth of about measured away from the impact feature the age of the rocks marked by the impact shows that this impact structure dates from roughly 66 million years ago , the end of the cretaceous period , and the start of the paleogene period gerta keller of princeton university argues that recent core samples from chicxulub prove the impact occurred about 300,000 years before the mass extinction , and thus could not have been the causal factor this scenario may have occurred on earth at the end of the cretaceous , though shiva and the chicxulub craters might have been formed 300,000 years apart macleod conducted his analysis approximately from the chicxulub crater to control for possible changes in soil composition at the impact site , while still close enough to be affected by the impact it suggests the impact was so great it shocked and melted rocks found deep in the crust , causing them to shoot up before falling back down to produce the peak rings
