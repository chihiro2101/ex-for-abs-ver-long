q-switching is achieved by putting some type of variable attenuator inside the laser 's optical resonator initially the laser medium is pumped while the q-switch is set to prevent feedback of light into the gain medium ( producing an optical resonator with low q ) since the rate of stimulated emission is dependent on the amount of light entering the medium , the amount of energy stored in the gain medium increases as the medium is pumped at this point , the q-switch device is quickly changed from low to high q , allowing feedback and the process of optical amplifier by stimulated emission to begin because of the large amount of energy already stored in the gain medium , the intensity of light in the laser resonator builds up very quickly ; this also causes the energy stored in the medium to be depleted almost as quickly the net result is a short pulse of light output from the laser , known as a giant pulse , which may have a very high peak intensity an additional advantage of modulators is that the rejected light may be coupled out of the cavity and can be used for something else initially , the loss of the absorber is high , but still low enough to permit some lasing once a large amount of energy is stored in the gain medium ideally , this brings the absorber into a state with low losses to allow efficient extraction of the stored energy by the laser pulse after the pulse , the absorber recovers to its high-loss state before the gain recovers , so that the next pulse is delayed until the energy in the gain medium is fully replenished with cavity dumper , the cavity end mirrors are 100 % reflective , so that no output beam is produced when the q is high a dumped cavity is more complicated to align than simple q-switching , and may need a control loop to choose the best time at which to dump the beam from the cavity pulses of light from another laser ( the '' master oscillator '' ) are injected into the cavity by lowering the q to allow the pulse to enter and then increasing the q to confine the pulse to the cavity where it can be amplified by repeated passes through the gain medium
