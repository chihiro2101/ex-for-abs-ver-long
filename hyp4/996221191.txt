the iao was established after admiral john poindexter , former united states national security advisor to president ronald reagan , and saic executive brian hicks approached the us department of defense with the idea for an information awareness program after the attacks of 9/11 the iao began funding research and development of the total information awareness ( tia ) program in february 2003 but renamed the program the terrorism information awareness program in may that year after an adverse media reaction to the program 's implications for public surveillance although tia was only one of several iao projects , many critics and news reports conflated tia with other related research projects of the iao , with the result that tia came in popular usage to stand for an entire subset of iao programs the tia program itself was the '' systems-level '' program of the iao that intended to integrate information technologies into a prototype system to provide tools to better detect , classify , and identify potential terrorists with the goal to increase the probability that authorized agencies of the united states could preempt adverse actions as a systems-level program of programs , tia 's goal was the creation of a '' counter-terrorism information architecture '' that integrated technologies from other iao programs ( and elsewhere , as appropriate ) the tia program was researching , developing , and integrating technologies to virtually aggregate data , to follow subject-oriented link analysis , to develop descriptive and predictive models through data mining or human hypothesis , and to apply such models to additional datasets to identify terrorists and terrorist groups among the other iao programs that were intended to provide tia with component data aggregation and automated analysis technologies were the genisys , genisys privacy protection , evidence extraction and link discovery , and scalable social network analysis programs poindexter gave a speech at darpatech 2002 entitled '' overview of the information awareness office '' overview of the information awareness office in which he described the tia program in february 2003 , congress passed legislation suspending activities of the iao pending a congressional report of the office 's activities ( consolidated appropriations resolution , 2003 , no.108–7 , division m , §111 ( b ) signed feb as a result , house and senate negotiators moved to prohibit further funding for the tia program by adding provisions to the department of defense appropriations act , 2004 department of defense appropriations act , 2004 , pub further , the joint explanatory statement included in the conference committee report specifically directed that the iao as program manager for tia be terminated immediately iao research was conducted along five major investigative paths : secure collaboration problem solving ; structured discovery ; link and group understanding ; context aware visualization ; and decision making with corporate memory develop and demonstrate a human identification system that operates out to 150 meters ( 500 & nbsp ; ft ) using visible imagery evidence extraction and link discovery ( eeld ) developed technologies and tools for automated discovery , extraction and linking of sparse evidence contained in large amounts of classified and unclassified data sources ( such as phone call records from the nsa call database , internet histories , or bank records ) it was to develop the ability to detect patterns comprising multiple types of links between data items or people communicating ( e.g it is designed to link items relating potential '' terrorist '' groups and scenarios , and to learn patterns of different groups or scenarios to identify new organizations and emerging threats scalable social network analysis ( ssna ) aimed at developing techniques based on social network analysis for modeling the key characteristics of terrorist groups and discriminating these groups from other types of societal groups translingual information detection , extraction and summarization ( tides ) developed advanced language processing technology to enable english speakers to find and interpret critical information in multiple languages without requiring knowledge of those languages one technology , codenamed '' basketball '' , is the information awareness prototype system , the core architecture to integrate all the tia 's information extraction , analysis , and dissemination tools in the following months , as more information emerged about the scope of the tia project , civil libertarians became concerned over what they saw as the potential for the development of an orwellian mass surveillance system intelligence community to '' connect the dots '' between pieces of intelligence malintent—similar program to humanid mass surveillance multistate anti-terrorism information exchange pre-crime concept in criminology prism ( surveillance program ) synthetic environment for analysis and simulations talon ( database ) utah data center copies of the original iao web pages formerly available at ( june 12 , 2002 – june 3 , 2003 ) can be found at john poindexter , overview of the information awareness office ( remarks as prepared for delivery by dr
