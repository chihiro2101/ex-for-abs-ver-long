desmostylians were large , fully aquatic quadrupeds with massive limbs and short tails the smallest is ashoroa laticosta , a relatively large animal at a body length of 168 & nbsp ; cm , while the largest species reached sizes comparable to steller 's sea cow the mandible and maxilla typically have forward-pointing incisors and canine tusks , followed by a long postcanine diastema , partly because of the reduced number of premolars their dental and skeletal forms suggest that desmostylians were aquatic herbivores dependent on littoral habitats based on a comparison of trunk and limb proportions , concluded that desmostylians were more terrestrial than aquatic and clearly fore limb-dominated swimmers , hence they were more similar to '' sea bears '' than '' sea sloths '' ( as proposed by other researchers ) however , a more recent and detailed analysis of desmostylian bone structure has revealed them to be fully aquatic , like sirenians and cetaceans , with their limbs being incapable of supporting their own weight on land desmostylians , being fully marine herbivores , are thought to have been outcompeted ecologically by dugongid sirenians in particular , later species like neoparadoxia are more specialised than previous forms , suggesting increased divergence to compete with sirenians , and sirenian diversity appears to increase with desmostylian decline giant extinct mammal identified from unalaska fossils , alaska dispatch news , mike dunham , october 7 , 2015 douglas emlong 's 1971 discovery of the new genus behemotops from oregon showed that early desmostylians had more proboscidean-like teeth and jaws than later ones
