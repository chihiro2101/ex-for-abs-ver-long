the first practical large-scale application of stratigraphy was by william smith in the 1790s and early 19th century other influential applications of stratigraphy in the early 19th century were by georges cuvier and alexandre brongniart , who studied the geology of the region around paris key concepts in stratigraphy involve understanding how certain geometric relationships between rock layers arise and what these geometries imply about their original depositional environment cyclostratigraphy documents the often cyclic changes in the relative proportions of minerals ( particularly carbonates ) , grain size , thickness of sediment layers ( varves ) and fossil diversity with time , related to seasonal or longer term changes in palaeoclimates biostratigraphy or paleontology stratigraphy is based on fossil evidence in the rock layers biologic stratigraphy was based on william smith 's principle of faunal succession , which predated , and was one of the first and most powerful lines of evidence for , biological evolution the geologic time scale was developed during the 19th century , based on the evidence of biologic stratigraphy and faunal succession stratigraphy is also commonly used to delineate the nature and extent of hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir rocks , seals , and traps of petroleum geology chronostratigraphy is the branch of stratigraphy that places an absolute age , rather than a relative age on rock strata the branch is concerned with deriving geochronology data for rock units , both directly and inferentially , so that a sequence of time-relative events that created the rocks formation can be derived assise bed ( geology ) conodont biostratigraphy erygmascope ( old instrument for studying strata ) harris matrix important publications in stratigraphy international commission on stratigraphy key bed sedimentary basin analysis sequence stratigraphy sadler effect tectonostratigraphy ics subcommission for stratigraphic information university of south carolina sequence stratigraphy web front range stratigraphy international commission on stratigraphy university of georgia ( usa ) stratigraphy lab stratigraphy.net a stratigraphic data provider
