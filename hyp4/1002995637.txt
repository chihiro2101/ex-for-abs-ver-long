however , the difference in frame rates between film ( generally 24 frames/s ) and television ( 30 or 25 frames/s , interlaced ) meant that simply playing a film into a television camera would result in flickering originally the kinescope was used to record the image from a television display to film , synchronized to the tv scan rate however , this still left film shot at cinema frame rates as a problem a more advanced technique is to use '' 2:3 pulldown '' , discussed below , which turns every second frame of the film into three fields of video , which results in a slightly smoother display however , during the analogue broadcasting period , the 24 frame per second film was shown at a slightly faster 25 frames per second rate , to match the pal video signal home movies originally on film may be transferred to video tape using this technique , and it is not uncommon to find telecined dvds where the source was originally recorded on videotape , or shot on film and then edited on tape every time the video ( tele ) part of the telecine samples the light electronically , the film ( cine ) part of the telecine must have a frame in perfect registration and ready to photograph this is relatively easy when the film is photographed at the same frame rate as the video camera will sample , but when this is not true , a sophisticated procedure is required to change frame rate in countries that use the pal or secam video standards , film destined for television is photographed at 25 frames per second the pal video standard broadcasts at 25 frames per second , so the transfer from film to video is simple ; for every film frame , one video frame is captured for film at 24 frame/s , there are 24 frames of film for every 25 frames of pal video this can be accomplished by inserting a pulldown field every 12 frames , thus effectively spreading 12 frames of film over 25 fields ( or '' 12.5 frames '' ) of pal video they are rendered at exactly 25.000 frames per second ; then , for pal/secam distribution , ordinary 2:2 pulldown is applied , but for ntsc distribution , 199 fields out of every 1001 are repeated
