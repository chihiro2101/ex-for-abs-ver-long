in 1717 , a flintlock musket for the french infantry was standardized this became the first standard flintlock musket to be issued to all french troops while it is more correctly called a french infantry musket or a french pattern musket , these muskets later became known as '' charleville muskets '' , after the armory in charleville-mézières , ardennes , france some references only refer to model 1763 and later versions as charleville flintlock muskets , while other references refer to all models as the charleville the charleville musket 's design was refined several times during its service life later models of charleville muskets remained in service until 1840 , when percussion cap systems made the flintlock mechanism obsolete this made the charleville sturdier than the british brown bess musket , which used pins to hold the barrel in place after numerous musket designs in the late 17th and early 18th century , the infantry musket was standardized in what would become the model 1717 this model standardized most of the design features that would be common to all subsequent models , such as a the model 1717 also standardized the smoothbore barrel and flintlock firing mechanism unlike later models , the model 1717 had a pinned barrel , similar in design of the british brown bess the model 1728 replaced the pinned barrel with a barrel held in place by three barrel bands , which would become standard on all subsequent charleville muskets the barrel band design was not only easier to disassemble for cleaning , but was also sturdier , which was an important consideration in bayonet combat after the seven years ' war ( in north america often known as the french and indian war ) , the french infantry musket was redesigned , resulting in the model 1763 a total of 88,000 model 1763 muskets were produced the model 1763 's sturdier design proved to be a bit too heavy , so in 1766 the musket 's design was lightened though usually considered to be a separate model , the model 1766 was often referred to as a '' light model 1763 '' musket , especially in revolutionary war invoices the model 1770 had a modified lock plate , stronger barrel bands , and a modified retaining spring the russian model 1808 musket was based heavily on the design of the model 1777 charleville the tula musket was manufactured with only minor changes until 1845 , when it was replaced by a percussion lock musket charleville muskets were also copied by belgium , austria and prussia as the augustin 1842 musket and potzdam musket '' small arms '' , the encyclopedia american , 1920 the charleville 1766 heavily influenced the design of the model 1795 musket
