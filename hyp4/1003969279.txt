the history of group dynamics ( or group processes ) has a consistent , underlying premise : 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts ' a social group is an entity that has qualities which can not be understood just by studying the individuals that make up the group as a field of study , group dynamics has roots in both psychology and sociology eventually , the social psychology kurt lewin ( 1890–1947 ) coined the term group dynamics to describe the positive and negative forces within groups of people in 1945 , he established the group dynamics research center at the massachusetts institute of technology , the first institute devoted explicitly to the study of group dynamics throughout his career , lewin was focused on how the study of group dynamics could be applied to real-world , social issues increasingly , research has applied evolutionary psychology principles to group dynamics as humans social environments became more complex , they acquired adaptations by way of group dynamics that enhance survival examples include mechanisms for dealing with status , reciprocity , identifying cheaters , ostracism , altruism , group decision , leadership , and intergroup relations also , a combination of evolution and game theory has been used to explain the development and maintenance of cooperative behavior between individuals in a group gustave le bon was a french social psychologist whose seminal study , the crowd : a study of the popular mind ( 1896 ) led to the development of group psychology the british psychologist william mcdougall in his work the group mind ( 1920 ) researched the dynamics of groups of various sizes and degrees of organization he coined the term group dynamics to describe the way groups and individuals act and react to changing circumstances william schutz ( 1958 , 1966 ) looked at interpersonal relations as stage-developmental , inclusion ( am i included ? ) , control ( who is top dog here ? ) , and affection ( do i belong here ? ) he discovered several mass group processes which involved the group as a whole adopting an orientation which , in his opinion , interfered with the ability of a group to accomplish the work it was nominally engaged in the tavistock institute has further developed and applied the theory and practices developed by bion bruce tuckman ( 1965 ) proposed the four-stage model called tuckman 's stages for a group this model refers to the overall pattern of the group , but of course individuals within a group work in different ways , communities ) which are similar to tuckman 's stages of group development enabling structure : which results from having tasks which have variety , a group size that is not too large , talented group members who have at least moderate social skill , and strong norms that specify appropriate behaviour supportive context : which occurs in groups nested in larger groups ( e.g examples of groups include religious , political , military , and environmental groups , sports teams , work groups , and therapy groups amongst the members of a group , there is a state of interdependence , through which the behaviours , attitudes , opinions , and experiences of each member are collectively influenced by the other group members in many fields of research , there is an interest in understanding how group dynamics influence individual behaviour , attitudes , and opinions often , there are distinct subgroups within a more broadly defined group residents ( ‘ americans ’ ) as a group , but could also define a more specific set of u.s the social cohesion approach suggests that group formation comes out of bonds of interpersonal attraction so to say , a level of psychological distinctiveness is necessary for group formation through interaction , individuals begin to develop group norms , roles , and attitudes which define the group , and are internalized to influence behaviour for example , in response to a natural disaster , an emergent response group may form it also offers friendship , potential new interests , learning new skills , and enhancing self esteem according to howard kelley and john thibaut , a group may be attractive to us in terms of costs and benefits , but that attractiveness alone does not determine whether or not we will join the group instead , our decision is based on two factors : our comparison level , and our comparison level for alternatives in john thibaut and harold kelley 's social exchange theory , comparison level is the standard by which an individual will evaluate the desirability of becoming a member of the group and forming new social relationships within the group those individuals who have experienced positive rewards with few costs in previous relationships and groups will have a higher comparison level than a person who experienced more negative costs and fewer rewards in previous relationships and group memberships as well , group membership will be unsatisfying to a new member if the outcomes are below the individual 's comparison level comparison level only predicts how satisfied a new member will be with the social relationships within the group this comparison level for alternatives is the standard by which an individual will evaluate the quality of the group in comparison to other groups the individual has the opportunity to join to summarize , if membership in the group is above the comparison level for alternatives and above the comparison level , the membership within the group will be satisfying and an individual will be more likely to join the group if membership in the group is above the comparison level for alternatives but below the comparison level , membership will be not be satisfactory ; however , the individual will likely join the group since no other desirable options are available groups can vary drastically from one another for example , three best friends who interact every day as well as a collection of people watching a movie in a theater both constitute a group past research has identified four basic types of groups which include , but are not limited to : primary groups , social groups , collective groups , and categories for example , in an experiment , participants were asked to sort a number of groups into categories based on their own criteria examples of groups to be sorted were a sports team , a family , people at a bus stop and women individuals that are a part of primary groups consider the group to be an important part of their lives consequently , members strongly identify with their group , even without regular meetings cooley believed that primary groups were essential for integrating individuals into their society since this is often their first experience with a group they are loosely formed , spontaneous , and brief examples of collectives include a flash mob , an audience at a movie , and a crowd watching a building burn categories are characterized by a collection of individuals who are similar in some way entitativity is defined by campbell as the extent to which collections of individuals are perceived to be a group the degree of entitativity that a group has is influenced by whether a collection of individuals experience the same fate , display similarities , and are close in proximity the social group is a critical source of information about individual identity instead , we make evaluations that are self-enhancing , emphasizing the positive qualities of our own group ( see ingroup bias ) in the social sciences , group cohesion refers to the processes that keep members of a social group connected it is thought to be one of the most important characteristics of a group , and has been linked to group performance , group conflict and therapeutic change lewin defined group cohesion as the willingness of individuals to stick together , and believed that without cohesiveness a group could not exist group structure has also been defined as the underlying pattern of roles , norms , and networks of relations among members that define and organize the group roles may be assigned formally , but more often are defined through the process of role differentiation status differentials may affect the relative amount of pay among group members and they may also affect the group 's tolerance to violation of group norms ( e.g social orientation theory considers the way a person approaches social situations according to social identity theory , intergroup conflict starts with a process of comparison between individuals in one group ( the ingroup ) to those of another group ( the outgroup )
