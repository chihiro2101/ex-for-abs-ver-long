large print jobs were not a problem , but small numbers of printed pages were typically during the early 20th century produced using stencils and reproducing on a mimeograph or similar machine and to print on a teletypewriter , line printer or other computer printer , but the software and hardware to produce original good-quality printed colour text and graphics and to print small jobs fast and cheaply was unavailable print on demand with digital technology is a way to print items for a fixed cost per copy , regardless of the size of the order while the unit price of each physical copy is greater than with offset printing , the average cost is lower for very small print jobs , because setup costs are much greater for offset printing pod has other business benefits besides lesser costs ( for small jobs ) : technical set-up is usually quicker than for offset printing large inventories of a book or print material do not need to be kept in stock , reducing storage , handling costs , and inventory accounting costs many publishers use pod for other printing needs other than books such as galley proof , catalogs and review copies digital technology is ideally suited to publish small print jobs of posters ( often as a single copy ) when they are needed pod creates a new category of publishing ( or printing ) company that offers services , usually for a fee , directly to authors who wish to self-publish pod publishing gives authors editorial independence , speed to market , ability to revise content , and greater financial return per copy than royalties paid by conventional publishers print on demand is also used to print and reprint '' niche '' books that may have a high retail price but limited sales opportunities , such as specialist academic works an academic publisher may be expected to keep these specialist works in print even though the target market is almost saturated , making further conventional print jobs uneconomic print on demand also allows books to be printed in a variety of formats unless the publisher or author has fixed their discount rate , the greater the volume sold , the less the royalty becomes , as the retailer is able to buy at greater discount because the per-unit cost is typically greater with pod than with a print job of thousands of copies , it is common for pod books to be more expensive than similar books made by conventional print jobs , especially if a book is produced exclusively with pod instead of using pod as a supplemental technology between print jobs stocked books are usually also available through '' sale or return '' , meaning that the book store can return unsold stock for full credit as much as one year after the initial sale
