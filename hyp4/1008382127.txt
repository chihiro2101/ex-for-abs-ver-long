in the 1954 parliamentary elections the syrian regional branch won 22 seats in parliament , becoming the second largest party in the country 90 percent of ba'ath party members who stood for elections were elected to parliament the failure of the traditional parties represented by the people 's party and the national party , strengthened the ba'ath party 's public credibility through this position , the party was able to get two of its members into the cabinet ; bitar was appointed minister of foreign affairs and khalil kallas became minister of economics its new , strengthened position , was used successfully to garner support for syria 's merger with gamal abdel nasser 's egypt , which led to the establishment of the united arab republic ( uar ) in 1958 on 24 june 1959 , fuad al-rikabi , the regional secretary of the iraqi regional branch , accused the national command of betraying arab nationalist principles by conspiring against the uar the congress is notable for endorsing the dissolution of the syrian regional branch , which had been decided by aflaq and bitar without inner-party consultation in 1958 , and for expelling rimawi , the regional secretary of the jordanian regional branch rimawi reacted to his expulsion by forming his own party , the arab socialist revolutionary ba'ath party , which established a rival national command to compete with the original the national command responded to the problems in iraq by appointing a temporary regional command on 2 february 1960 , which appointed talib el-shibib as regional secretary , and on 15 june 1961 the national command expelled rikabi from the party in iraq , the iraqi regional branch had supported abd al-karim qasim 's seizure of power and its ensuing abolishment of the iraqi monarchy the iraqi ba'athists supported qasim on the ground that they believed he would enter iraq into the uar , enlarging the arab nationalist republic in retaliation , the ba'ath party tried to assassinate qasim in february 1959 , but the operation ( which was led by a young saddam hussein ) failed on a separate plan to instigate a military coup against qasim , and who later became the head of the cia 's operations in iraq and syria '' from late 1968 to june 1970 , '' has '' denied any involvement in the ba'ath party 's actions the 4th national congress , held in august 1960 , criticized the leadership of aflaq and bitar , called for the reestablishment of the syrian regional branch and deemphasized the party 's commitment to arab nationalism while emphasizing more the socialist character of the party the challenges of building a ba'athist state led to considerable ideological discussion and internal struggle within the party aflaq , angry at this transformation of his party , retained a nominal leadership role , but the national command as a whole came under the control of the radicals in 1963 the ba'ath party seized power , from then on the ba'ath functioned as the only officially recognized syrian political party , but factionalism and splintering within the party led to a succession of governments and new constitutions although he and his supporters had not been supporters of the victorious far-left line at the 6th party congress , they had now moved to adopt its positions however , both in iraq and syria , the regional command became the real centre of party power , and the membership of the national command became a largely honorary position , often the destination of figures being eased out of the leadership the organizational structure of the ba'ath party was created at the 2nd national congress by amending the party 's internal regulations , which was approved at the party 's 1st national congress in 1947 the national congress elected the national command , national tribunal , the party 's discipline body , and the secretary-general , the party leader the regional congress , which combined all the provincial branches , was the region 's highest authority and elected a regional command , the party leadership in a specific region , the regional tribunal , the body responsible for discipline inspection , and a regional secretary , the regional party leader the regional congress was responsible for evaluating the party 's performance since the last regional congress , while at the same time formulating new policies for the next period , which lasts until the next regional congress is held the regional command , similar to the branch command , operated through bureaus and met for weekly-sessions the branch came above the subbranch ; it comprised at least two to five subbranches , and operated at the provincial level it elected its own command , composed of five members , but the subbranch appointed the command 's secretary they functioned as the party ’ s watchdog and were an effective form of covert surveillance within a public administration it was composed of three to seven members , constituted the basic organizational unit the military organization was made up of branches similar to those in the ba'ath 's civilian sector from its very beginning , the party was a manifestation of arab nationalist thought , with the party itself referring to itself as '' the party of arab unity '' the pan-arab tendencies of the party 's predecessor , the arab ba'ath movement , was strengthened 1945–1947 by recruiting members from the zaki al-arsuzi 's arab ba'ath no arab can live apart from the others '' to express his heartfelt belief in arab nationalism , aflaq coined the term '' one arab nation with an eternal message '' party ideology , and ba'athism in general , was not based on concepts such as the purity of the arab race or ethnic chauvinism , but on idealistic thoughts borrowed from the enlightenment era according to middle east expert tabitha petran , the basic idea of the party 's ideology was ; that the arab nation is a permanent entity in history the early ba'ath gave little attention to the problems facing the peasants and workers to take an example , in one instance aflaq states '' the national struggle when the akram al-hawrani 's arab socialist party ( asp ) merged with the ba'ath party , the majority of asp members of peasants origins did not join the ba'ath party , instead becoming personal followers of hawrani the '' transitional ba'ath '' , which grew out of the dissolution of the syrian regional branch in 1958 dissolution and the military committee , were more rural in outlook , policy and ideology aflaq believed that the ba'ath party , at least in theory , would rule , and guide the people , in a transitional period of time without consulting the people , however he did support intra-party democracy the last tenet , 'socialism ' , did not mean socialism as it is defined in the west , but rather a unique form of arab socialism after the failure of the united arab republic ( uar ) , a union of egypt and syria , the ba'ath party was divided into two main factions , the regionalists and the nationalists ( pan-arab ) however , being the unionist party that it was , the party 's leaders could not state their position on this issue on 21 february 1962 , the national command issued a new policy regarding the pan-arab project by first mentioning the successes and failures of the uar , but ending the statement by calling for the reestablishment of the uar as a decentralized federation with nasser 's egypt the provincial party members had not been told of the syrian regional branch 's dissolution , which in fact broke the communication line with provincial branches and the national command the iraqi regional branch supported abd al-karim qasim 's rule on the grounds that he would seek iraq 's entry into the united arab republic because of his policy reversal , the regional branch gathered a group , led by saddam hussein , which tried but failed to assassinate qasim at the 6th national congress , the lebanese regional branch elected jubrän majdalani and khalid al-ali to the national command at the 7th national congress the national command in collaboration with the military committee either expelled or removed leftists such as those found in the lebanese regional branch from leadership position , and in the most severe cases , expelled them from the party the lebanese regional branch managed to elect three members to the national command at the 7th national congress ; majdalani , al-ali and abd al-majid rafi in addition to parliamentary-level competition , all these parties ( as well as islamism ) competed in street-level activity and sought to recruit support among the military
