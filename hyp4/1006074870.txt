friedman was born wolf friedman , , in chişinău , bessarabia , the son of frederick friedman , a jew from bucharest who worked as a translator and linguist for the russian postal service , and the daughter of a well-to-do wine merchant friedman : principal cryptologist '' three years later , his first name was changed to william friedman joined fabyan 's riverbank laboratories outside chicago in september 1915 they married , and he soon became director of riverbank 's department of codes and ciphers as well as its department of genetics during this time , friedman wrote a series of 8 papers on cryptography , collectively known as the '' riverbank publications '' , including the first description of the index of coincidence , an important mathematical tool in cryptanalysis with the entry of the united states into world war i , fabyan offered the services of his department of codes and ciphers to the government analyzing the format of the messages , riverbank realized that the code was based on a dictionary of some sort , a cryptographic technique common at the time friedman coined several terms , including '' cryptanalysis '' , and wrote many monographs on cryptography one of these ( written mostly in his spare time ) was the first draft of his elements of cryptanalysis , which later was expanded to four volumes and became the u.s realizing that mathematical and language skills were essential to sis ' work , friedman managed to get authority to hire three men with both mathematical training and language knowledge during this period elizebeth friedman continued her own work in cryptology , and became famous in a number of trials involving rum-runners and the coast guard and fbi during prohibition left during the 1920s , several new cipher machines were developed generally based on using typewriter mechanics and basic electrical circuitry friedman realized that the new rotor machines would be important , and devoted some time to analyzing hebern 's design friedman used his understanding of rotor machines to develop several that were immune to his own attacks the best of the lot was the sigaba—which was destined to become the us 's highest-security cipher machine in world war ii after improvements by frank rowlett and laurance safford the message gave a clear indication of impending war , and was to have been delivered to the us state department only hours prior to the attack on pearl harbor at nsa 's request friedman prepared six lectures concerning cryptography and cryptanalysis , which he delivered at nsa barbara friedman ( later atchison ) ( born 1923 ) , and john ramsay friedman ( 1926–2010 ) schoen shares a significant background and personality traits with friedman , including being one of the top cryptanalysts of the u.s
