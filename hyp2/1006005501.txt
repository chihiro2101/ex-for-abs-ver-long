as a rule , mitochondrial diseases are worse when the defective mitochondria are present in the muscles , cerebrum , or nerves , because these cells use more energy than most other cells in the body mitochondrial disorders may be caused by mutations ( acquired or inherited ) , in mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) , or in nuclear genes that code for mitochondrial components they may also be the result of acquired mitochondrial dysfunction due to adverse effects of drugs , infections , or other environmental causes oxalate may enter cells where it is known to cause mitochondrial dysfunction mitochondrial disease may become clinically apparent once the number of affected mitochondria reaches a certain level ; this phenomenon is called '' threshold expression '' mitochondria possess many of the same dna repair pathways as nuclei doâ€”but not all of them ; therefore , mutations occur more frequently in mitochondrial dna than in nuclear dna ( see mutation rate ) this means that mitochondrial dna disorders may occur spontaneously and relatively often human mitochondrial dna encodes 13 proteins of the respiratory chain , while most of the estimated 1,500 proteins and components targeted to mitochondria are nuclear-encoded other studies have shown that the mechanism may involve the interruption of the mitochondrial signaling process in body cells ( intramyocellular lipids ) the energy output of full healthy mitochondrial function can be predicted exactly by a complicated theoretical argument , but this argument is not straightforward , as most energy is consumed by the brain and is not easily measurable the most common tests for the detection of these diseases are : southern blot to detect big deletions or duplications polymerase chain reaction and specific mutation testing sequencing in june 2018 australian senate 's senate community affairs references committee recommended a move towards legalising mitochondrial replacement therapy ( mrt ) the first pathogenic mutation in mitochondrial dna was identified in 1988 ; from that time to 2016 , around 275 other disease-causing mutations were identified
