in 1932 , jan oort became the first to report that measurements of the stars in the solar neighborhood indicated that they moved faster than expected when a mass distribution based upon visible matter was assumed , but these measurements were later determined to be essentially erroneous he attributed that to either the absorption of light within the galaxy or to modified dynamics in the outer portions of the spiral and not to any form of missing matter babcock 's measurements turned out to disagree substantially with those found later , and the first measurement of an extended rotation curve in good agreement with modern data was published in 1957 by henk van de hulst and collaborators , who studied m31 with the newly commissioned dwingeloo 25 meter telescope a companion paper by maarten schmidt showed that this rotation curve could be fit by a flattened mass distribution more extensive than the light these results suggested that either gravity does not apply universally or that , conservatively , upwards of 50 % of the mass of galaxies was contained in the relatively dark galactic halo if newtonian mechanics is assumed to be correct , it would follow that most of the mass of the galaxy had to be in the galactic bulge near the center and that the stars and gas in the disk portion should orbit the center at decreasing velocities with radial distance from the galactic center ( the dashed line in fig the rotation curves might be explained by hypothesizing the existence of a substantial amount of matter permeating the galaxy outside of the central bulge that is not emitting light in the mass-to-light ratio of the central bulge since observations of galaxy rotation do not match the distribution expected from application of kepler 's laws , they do not match the distribution of luminous matter this implies that spiral galaxies contain large amounts of dark matter or , in alternative , the existence of exotic physics in action on galactic scales so , while state-of-the-art cosmological and galaxy formation simulations of dark matter with normal baryonic matter included can be matched to galaxy observations , there is not yet any straightforward explanation as to why the observed scaling relationship exists additionally , detailed investigations of the rotation curves of low-surface-brightness galaxy ( lsb galaxies ) in the 1990s and of their position on the tullyâ€“fisher relation showed that lsb galaxies had to have dark matter haloes that are more extended and less dense than those of hsb galaxies and thus surface brightness is related to the halo properties using data from the spitzer photometry and accurate rotation curves ( sparc ) database , a group has found the radial acceleration traced by rotation curves could be predicted just from the observed baryon distribution ( that is , including stars and gas but not dark matter ) . a model of galaxy based on a general relativity metric was also proposed , showing that the rotation curves for the milky way , ngc 3031 , ngc 3198 and ngc 7331 are consistent with the mass density distributions of the visible matter , avoiding the need for a massive halo of exotic dark matter
