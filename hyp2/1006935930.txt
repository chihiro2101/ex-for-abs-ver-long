chromosomes were first observed in plant cells by carl wilhelm von n√§geli in 1842 their behavior in animal ( salamander ) cells was described by walther flemming , the discoverer of mitosis , in 1882 the name was coined by another german anatomist , heinrich von waldeyer in 1888 in 1922 seems to have been the first person to define the karyotype as the phenotypic appearance of the somatic chromosomes , in contrast to their gene contents comparative karyological study of species muscari mill 1-32in russian the subsequent history of the concept can be followed in the works of c 3rd ed , cambridge university press human chromosome 2 is now known to be a result of an end-to-end fusion of two ancestral ape chromosomes in order for the giemsa stain to adhere correctly , all chromosomal proteins must be digested and removed the association of cytogenetic technologists , raven press , new york the sex of an unborn fetus can be determined by observation of interphase cells ( see amniocentesis and barr body ) six different characteristics of karyotypes are usually observed and compared : differences in absolute sizes of chromosomes chromosomes can vary in absolute size by as much as twenty-fold between genera of the same family for example , the legumes lotus tenuis and vicia faba each have six pairs of chromosomes , yet v these differences probably reflect different amounts of dna duplication these differences probably arose from segmental interchange of unequal lengths humans have one pair fewer chromosomes than the great apes human chromosome 2 appears to have resulted from the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes , and many of the genes of those two original chromosomes have been translocated to other chromosomes satellites are small bodies attached to a chromosome by a thin thread heterochromatin consists mainly of genetically inactive and repetitive dna sequences as well as containing a larger amount of adenine-thymine pairs thompson & thompson genetics in medicine 7th ed euchromatin regions contain larger amounts of guanine-cytosine pairs the staining technique using giemsa staining is called g banding and therefore produces the typical '' g-bands '' the typical human karyotypes contain 22 pairs of autosome chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes ( allosomes ) some variations in karyotype , whether to autosomes or allosomes , cause chromosome abnormalities there is variation between species in chromosome number , and in detailed organization , despite their construction from the same chromatin this process is a carefully organised genome rearrangement where new telomeres are constructed and certain heterochromatin regions are lost suum , all the somatic cell precursors undergo chromatin diminution in placental mammals , the inactivation is random as between the two xs ; thus the mammalian female is a mosaic in respect of her x chromosomes the diploid number of the chinese muntjac , muntiacus reevesi , was found to be 46 , all telocentric when they looked at the karyotype of the closely related indian muntjac , muntiacus muntjak , they were astonished to find it had female 6 , male 7 chromosomes the number of chromosomes in the karyotype between ( relatively ) unrelated species is hugely variable the low record is held by the nematode parascaris univalens , where the haploid n 1 ; and an ant : myrmecia pilosula top score for animals might be the shortnose sturgeon acipenser brevirostrum at 372 chromosomes humans have fn 82 , due to the presence of five acrocentric chromosome pairs : 13 , 14 , 15 , 21 , and 22 ( the human y chromosome is also acrocentric ) ploidy is the number of complete sets of chromosomes in a cell in the endocycle ( endomitosis or endoreduplication ) chromosomes in a 'resting ' nucleus undergo reduplication , the daughter chromosomes separating from each other inside an intact nuclear membrane in many instances , endopolyploid nuclei contain tens of thousands of chromosomes ( which can not be exactly counted ) the archipelago itself ( produced by the pacific plate moving over a hot spot ) has existed for far longer , at least into the cretaceous the c-bonding proved to be especially well-suited for the characterization of plant chromosomes some karyotypes call the short and long arms p and q , respectively in addition , the differently stained regions and sub-regions are given numerical designations from proximal to distal on the chromosome arms fluorescently labeled probes for each chromosome are made by labeling chromosome-specific dna with different fluorophores
