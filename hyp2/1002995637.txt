by turning to film-originated material , they would have access to the wealth of films made for the cinema in addition to recorded television programming on film that could be aired at different times however , the difference in frame rates between film ( generally 24 frames/s ) and television ( 30 or 25 frames/s , interlaced ) meant that simply playing a film into a television camera would result in flickering however , this still left film shot at cinema frame rates as a problem this problem is not difficult to fix , however ; the solution being to periodically play a selected frame twice a more advanced technique is to use '' 2:3 pulldown '' , discussed below , which turns every second frame of the film into three fields of video , which results in a slightly smoother display the most complex part of telecine is the synchronization of the mechanical film motion and the electronic video signal every time the video ( tele ) part of the telecine samples the light electronically , the film ( cine ) part of the telecine must have a frame in perfect registration and ready to photograph this is relatively easy when the film is photographed at the same frame rate as the video camera will sample , but when this is not true , a sophisticated procedure is required to change frame rate to avoid the synchronization issues , higher-end establishments now use a scanning system rather than just a telecine system this allows them to scan a distinct frame of digital video for each frame of film , providing higher quality than a telecine system would be able to achieve similar issues occur when using vertical synchronization to prevent screen tearing , which is a different problem encountered when frame rates mismatch for the film 's motion to be accurately rendered on the video signal , a telecine must use a technique called the 2:3 pulldown , also known as 3:2 pulldown , to convert from 24 to ~29.97 frame/s discussion of telecine equipment by former bbc engineers demonstration of telecine process by telecine and archiving expert , tim emlem-english explanation of telecine methods
