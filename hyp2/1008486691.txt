in 1860 , joseph swan produced carbon fibers for the first time , for use in light bulbs in 1880 , lewis latimer developed a reliable carbon wire filament for the incandescent light bulb , heated by electricity in 1958 , roger bacon created high-performance carbon fibers at the union carbide parma technical center located outside of cleveland , ohio this process proved to be inefficient , as the resulting fibers contained only about 20 % carbon and had low strength and stiffness properties akio shindo at agency of industrial science and technology of japan , using polyacrylonitrile ( pan ) as a raw material 3,294,489 ) for producing a high carbon content ( 99 % ) fiber using rayon as a precursor these carbon fibers had sufficient strength ( modulus of elasticity and tensile strength ) to be used as a reinforcement for composites having high strength to weight properties and for high temperature resistant applications the high potential strength of carbon fiber was realized in 1963 in a process developed by w unfortunately , the blades proved vulnerable to damage from bird strike a 1970 joint technology agreement allowed union carbide to manufacture japan 's toray industries product intermediate carbon fibers , such as im 600 from toho rayon with up to 6,000 mpa were developed turbostratic carbon fibers tend to have high ultimate tensile strength , whereas heat-treated mesophase-pitch-derived carbon fibers have high young 's modulus ( i.e carbon fiber is most notably used to reinforce composite materials , particularly the class of materials known as carbon fiber reinforced polymer due to the formation of metal carbides and corrosion considerations , carbon has seen limited success in metal matrix composite applications molding a thin layer of carbon fibers significantly improves fire resistance of polymers or thermoset composites because a dense , compact layer of carbon fibers efficiently reflects heat carbon fiber yarn is rated by the linear density ( weight per unit length ; i.e precursor compositions and mechanical processes used during spinning filament yarns may vary among manufacturers the carbon can become further enhanced , as high modulus , or high strength carbon , by heat treatment processes basalt fiber carbon fiber reinforced polymer ceramic matrix composite carbon nanotube esd materials graphene
