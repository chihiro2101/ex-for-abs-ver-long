diffserv is a coarse-grained , class-based mechanism for traffic management diffserv-aware routers implement per-hop behaviors ( phbs ) , which define the packet-forwarding properties associated with a class of traffic different phbs may be defined to offer , for example , low-loss or low-latency service each router on the network is then configured to differentiate traffic based on its class each traffic class can be managed differently , ensuring preferential treatment for higher-priority traffic on the network the premise of diffserv is that complicated functions such as packet classification and policing can be carried out at the edge of the network by edge routers while diffserv does recommend a standardized set of traffic classes , the diffserv architecture does not incorporate predetermined judgments of what types of traffic should be given priority treatment diffserv simply provides a framework to allow classification and differentiated treatment the standard traffic classes ( discussed below ) serve to simplify interoperability between different networks and different vendors ' equipment network traffic entering a diffserv domain is subjected to classification and conditioning traffic in each class may be further conditioned by subjecting the traffic to rate limiting , traffic policers or shapers this gives a network operator great flexibility in defining traffic classes however , voice admit traffic is also admitted by the network using a call admission control ( cac ) procedure — definition of differentiated services per-domain behaviors and rules for their specification — a differentiated services code point ( dscp ) for capacity-admitted traffic — an informal management model for differentiated services routers
