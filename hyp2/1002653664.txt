laboratories used for scientific research take many forms because of the differing requirements of specialists in the various fields of science and engineering a physics laboratory might contain a particle accelerator or vacuum chamber , while a metallurgy laboratory could have apparatus for casting or refining metals or for testing their strength a chemist or biology might use a wet laboratory , while a psychology laboratory might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior in some laboratories , such as those commonly used by computer scientists , computers ( sometimes supercomputers ) are used for either simulations or the analysis of data and concepts like open innovation or user innovation , one distinctive feature of work in open labs is phenomena of translation , driven by the different backgrounds and levels of expertise of the people involved early instances of '' laboratories '' recorded in english involved alchemy and the preparation of medicines '' the emergence of big science during world war ii increased the size of laboratories and scientific equipment , introducing particle accelerators and similar devices the earliest laboratory according to the present evidence is a home laboratory of pythagoras of samos , the well-known greek philosopher and scientist this laboratory was created when pythagoras conducted an experiment about tones of sound and vibration of string rules exist to minimize the individual 's risk , and safety equipment is used to protect the lab users from injury or to assist in responding to an emergency the occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) in the united states , recognizing the unique characteristics of the laboratory workplace , has tailored a standard for occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals in laboratories training is critical to the ongoing safe operation of the laboratory facility work is divided , not only between different jobs of the laboratory such as the researchers , engineers and technicians , but also in terms of autonomy ( should the work be individual or in groups ) from the 1950s , the laboratory has evolved from being an educational tool used by teachers to attract the top students into research , into an organizational model allowing a high level of scientific productivity there are three main factors that contribute to the organizational form of a laboratory : the educational background of the researchers and their socialization process the intellectual process involved in their work , including the type of investigation and equipment they use the main subject of the study revolved around the relationship between the staff of a laboratory ( researchers , administrators , receptionists , technicians , etc in summary , differences in attitude among members of the laboratory are explained by social organization : a person 's attitudes are intimately related to the role they have in an organization
