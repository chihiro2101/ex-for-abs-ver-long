in biblical hebrew , the idea of repentance is represented by two verbs : שוב shuv ( to return ) and נחם nacham ( to feel sorrow ) in the new testament , the word translated as 'repentance ' is the greek word μετάνοια ( metanoia ) , '' after/behind one 's mind '' , which is a compound word of the preposition 'meta ' ( after , with ) , and the verb 'noeo ' ( to perceive , to think , the result of perceiving or observing ) metanoia is therefore primarily an after-thought , different from the former thought ; a change of mind and change of conduct , '' change of mind and heart '' , or , '' change of consciousness '' the doctrine of repentance as taught in the bible is a call to persons to make a radical turn from one way of life to another the repentance ( metanoia ) called for throughout the bible is a summons to a personal , absolute and ultimate unconditional surrender to god as sovereign 118-119 it is a change of mind that involves a conscious turning away from wrong actions , attitudes and thoughts that conflict with a godly lifestyle and biblical commands , and an intentional turning toward doing that which the bible says pleases god in repenting , one makes a complete change of direction ( 180° turn ) toward god repentance typically requires an admission of guilt for committing a wrong or for omitting to do the right thing ; a promise or resolve not to repeat the offense ; an attempt to make restitution for the wrong , or in some way to reverse the harmful effects of the wrong or the omission where possible many rabbinic sources state that repentance is of paramount importance to the existence of this world , so that it was one of the seven provisions which god made before the creation talmud bavli , tractates pesahim 54a ; nedarim 39b ; midrash genesis rabbah 1 '' the holy one , blessed be his name , said to elijah , 'behold , the precious gift which i have bestowed on my world : though a man sins again and again , but returns in penitence , i will receive him ' & nbsp ; '' jerusalem talmud sanhedrin 28b '' great is repentance : it brings healing into the world '' ; '' it reaches to the throne of the lord '' ; '' it brings redemption '' ; '' it prolongs man 's life '' ; talmud yoma 86a ) ( talmud taanith 16a ; mishneh torah teshuva 2:3 ) according to jewish doctrine , repentance is the prerequisite of atonement ( mishna yoma chapter 8 , 8 ) yom kippur , the day of atonement , derives its significance only from the fact that it is the culmination of the ten penitential days with which the jewish religious year begins ; and therefore it is of no avail without repentance midrash sifra , emor , 14 though man ought to be penitent every day , mishna avoth chap 2 , 10 ; talmud shabbath 153a the first ten days of every year are the acceptable time announced by the prophet isaiah : '' seek the lord while he may be found , call upon him while he is near '' talmud rosh hashan 18a ; mishneh torah teshuva 2:6 repentance and the day of atonement only absolve one from sins committed against god ; from sins against another person they absolve only when restitution has been made and the pardon of the offended party has been obtained jewish doctrine holds that it is never too late , even on the day of death , to return to god with sincere repentance for '' as the sea is always open for every one who wishes to cleanse himself , so are the gates of repentance always open to the sinner '' ( talmud pesachim 119a ; deuteronomy rabbah ii ) one view in the talmud holds that a repentant sinner attains a more exalted spiritual eminence than one who has never sinned ( talmud bava metsia 58b ; mishneh torah teshuva 8:8 ) repentance occupies a prominent position in all the ethical writings of the middle ages in the first case , the manifestation of repentance consists in : ( 1 ) confession of one 's sin before god , the essential part being a solemn promise and firm resolve not to commit the same sin again paul the apostle likewise testified '' both to jews and to greeks of repentance toward god '' and said that '' the times of ignorance god overlooked , but now he commands all people everywhere to repent '' it remains for us , in the third place , to explain our position , that repentance consists of two parts—the mortification of the flesh and the vivification of the spirit '' at-tahriim 66:8 although repentance is considered as one act that can be used for cleansing the sins , the quran notes that all of the sins are forgiven with or without repentance except the state of shirk , i.e
