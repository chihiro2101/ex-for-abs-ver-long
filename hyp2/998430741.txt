the british office of rail and road defines heritage railways as follows : 'lines of local interest ' , museum railways or tourist railways that have retained or assumed the character and appearance and operating practices of railways of former times many systems aim to replicate both the look and operating practices of historic former railways companies heritage railway lines have historic rail infrastructure which has been substituted ( or made obsolete ) in modern rail systems historical installations , such as hand-operated points , water cranes , and rails fastened with hand-hammered rail spikes , are characteristic features of heritage lines unlike tourist railways , which primarily carry tourists and have modern installations and vehicles , heritage-line infrastructure creates views and soundscapes of the past in operation due to a lack of modern technology or the desire for historical accuracy , railway operations can be handled with traditional practices such as the use of tokens heritage infrastructure and operations often require the assignment of roles , based on historical occupations , to the railway staff some , or all , staff and volunteers , including station masters and signalmen , sometimes wearing period-appropriate attire , can be seen on some heritage railways most heritage railways use heritage rolling stock , although modern rail vehicles can be used to showcase railway scenes with historical-line infrastructure the first children 's railway opened in moscow children 's railways : gorky park , moscow in 1932 and , at the breakup of the ussr , 52 children 's railways existed in the country many children 's railways were built on parkland in urban areas unlike many industrial areas typically served by a narrow-gauge railway , parks were free of redevelopment the engineering feats of past railway builders and views of pristine mountain scenes have made many railways in mountainous areas profitable tourist attractions wooden sleepers , gravel ballast and low rail weight with no overhead catenary make it uniquely historical in finnish the jokioinen museum railway is a stretch of preserved narrow-gauge railway between humppila and jokioinen in britain , heritage railways are often railway lines which were run as commercial railways but were no longer needed ( or closed down ) and were taken over or re-opened by volunteers or non-profit organisations the large number of heritage railways in the uk is due in part to the closure of many minor lines during the 1960s ' beeching cuts , and they were relatively easy to revive after the privatisation of main-line railways , the line between not-for-profit heritage railways and for-profit branch lines may be blurred many heritage railways host living-history events such as annual reenactments of historic activities , and may have an archive or library of railroad-related materials
