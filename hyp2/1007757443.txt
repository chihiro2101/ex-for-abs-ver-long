in monarchies with either an uncodified or partly unwritten constitution ( such as the united kingdom or canada ) or a wholly written constitution that consists of a text augmented by additional conventions , traditions , letters patent , etc there are usually strict constitutional conventions concerning when these powers may be used , and these conventions are enforced by public pressure most constitutional monarchies employ a system that includes the principle of responsible government in such an order , the reserve powers are thought to be the means by which the monarch and his or her viceregal representatives can legitimately exist as '' constitutional guardians '' or '' umpires '' , tasked with guaranteeing that cabinet and parliament adhere to the fundamental constitutional principles of the rule of law and responsible government itself evatt felt that the reserve powers could be codified and still serve their intended function in a responsible government system , as they do in ireland , japan , and sweden in belgium a constitutional provision explicitly states that no act of the monarch is valid without the signature of a member or members of the government , which thereby becomes solely responsible , hence excluding any reserve power for the crown in 1990 , when a law liberalising belgium 's abortion laws was approved by parliament , king baudouin refused to give his royal assent , only the second time in belgium 's history the monarch elected to do so instead , he requested that the cabinet declare him unable to reign for a day , which it did , thereby assuming the king 's constitutional powers after the balfour declaration was produced by the 1926 imperial conference , formally establishing the autonomy and equal status of commonwealth governments , governors-general ceased to be advised in any way by the british government in both cases an election was held very soon afterwards and , again in both cases , the dismissed government was massively defeated by popular vote in queensland in 1987 , during a tense period of leadership succession , the governor of queensland , sir walter campbell , exercised reserve power in declining to follow the advice of the premier , sir joh bjelke-petersen the reserve powers in canada fall within the royal prerogative and belong specifically to the monarch , as the constitution act , 1867 , vests all executive power in the country 's sovereign at the provincial level , on 29 june 2017 lieutenant governor of british columbia judith guichon used her reserve powers to deny the request of premier christy clark to dissolve the legislature and call a new election only 51 days after the recent provincial election guichon refused this advice and instead asked john horgan to form a government , becoming the new premier peter hogg , a constitutional scholar , has opined that '' a system of responsible government can not work without a formal head of state who is possessed of certain reserve powers it takes the place of the legal and judicial safeguards provided in the united states by written constitutions , enforceable in the courts as new zealand 's political system matured , the colonial office increasingly instructed the governors to follow the advice of local ministers , and the powers of the office have continually shrunk the most visible reserve powers are the power to appoint a prime minister and the related power to accept a prime minister 's resignation this power is exercised every time a general election results in a change of government , most recently in 2017 finally , it may happen if a prime minister is manoeuvred out of his position by his own party , retires or resigns for personal reasons , or dies in office conventionally , the governor-general follows the advice of the prime minister or another appropriate minister in matters of appointment and dismissal the governor-general can also dissolve parliament and call elections without prime ministerial advice however , all elections since responsible government was introduced , including snap elections , have been requested by the incumbent premier or prime minister , and are accordingly not examples of use of the reserve powers a prime minister who has lost the confidence of the house will conventionally either advise a dissolution of parliament and new elections , or tender his resignation if a defeated prime minister refuses to do either of these two things , the governor-general could use the reserve powers to either dismiss the prime minister ( see above ) , or dissolve parliament without the prime minister 's advice if a prime minister has been defeated by a vote of no confidence , a refusal by the governor-general to dissolve parliament would , in effect , force the prime minister to resign and make way for a successor see the lascelles principles for factors which might guide the governor-general in making a decision on whether or not to grant a dissolution in those circumstances a governor-general could also legally refuse a request for a snap election from a prime minister in whom the house has confidence , but such a refusal would be extremely unlikely others , such as professor philip joseph , believe the governor-general does retain the power to refuse royal assent to bills in exceptional circumstances - such as the abolition of democracy muldoon eventually relented under pressure from his own cabinet , making the use of beattie 's reserve powers unnecessary a constitutional crisis occurred in saint kitts and nevis in 1981 , when the governor , sir probyn inniss , used his reserve powers to refuse assent to a bill passed by the government of sir kennedy simmonds , the country 's premier inniss believed that the bill was unconstitutional , and would soon be struck down by the eastern caribbean supreme court the constitution of tuvalu provides , in article 52 , that the governor-general exercises his powers '' only in accordance with the advice of ( a ) the cabinet ; or ( b ) the prime minister or ( e ) in his own deliberate judgment ( in which case he shall exercise an independent discretion ) '' on 28 june , prime minister willy telavi 's government had lost a crucial by-election , which gave the opposition a majority of one in parliament '' tuvalu ’ s opposition waiting to hear from gg '' , islands business , 1 july 2013 prime minister telavi responded that , under the constitution , he was only required to convene parliament once a year ( for a vote on the budget ) , and was thus under no obligation to summon it until december in the uk , the monarch has numerous theoretical personal prerogatives , but beyond the appointment of a prime minister , there are in practice few circumstances in modern british government where these prerogatives could be justifiably exercised ; they have rarely been exercised in the last century this was last reputedly considered in 1910 , but george v later changed his mind harold wilson , leading a minority government in 1974 , was advised elizabeth ii might refuse to dissolve parliament if she could identify an alternative prime minister able to command a cross-party majority the constitution of spain explicitly says article 53.3 the king is not subject to any responsibility but his acts to be valid must be endorsed by the government and will not be valid without such an endorsement however , the president has the authority to dissolve the government or parliament , grant pardon to criminals , block bills/budgets by the legislature or declare an emergency in his book , le coup d'état permanent ( the permanent coup ) , françois mitterrand criticized article 16 for allowing an ambitious politician the opportunity to become a dictator the german constitution limits the powers available to the president to prevent a situation in which the executive could effectively rule without legislative approval , which was the case in the weimar republic the president of the republic can refuse to sign laws he deems clearly against the constitution , while less obvious cases are dealt with later on by the constitutional court
