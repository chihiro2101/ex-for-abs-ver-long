a significant number of moorcock 's novels and short stories take place in one shared multiverse : a wide array of interconnected parallel universes , many-layered dimensions , spheres , and alternative worlds , which spans from the big bang to the end of time and from earth to faraway galaxies the eternal champion is , as a matter of fact , an appointed paladin of balance who is bound to exist in each and every world and age of the multiverse , so that law and chaos are perpetually kept in check ; however , he often does not know of his role , or , even worse , he struggles against it , never to succeed since he must intervene whenever either law or chaos has gained an excess of power , requiring him to tip the scales accordingly , he is always doomed to be surrounded by strife and destruction , although he may go through long periods of relative quiet all the different eternal champions are implied to be different facets or '' incarnations '' of one semi-conscious being ( a platonic archetype of a sort ) : most of them are peerless fighters and generals and have an unbreakable bond with a sentient chaos-aligned weapon , the black sword , which in turns takes on a different form for each champion likewise , many champions are aided by an eternal companion and an eternal consort : a sidekick and a love interest who are themselves aspects of two semi-divine figures this recursivity through the multiverse is further underlined by the number of champions , companions , and mentor-figures to the champions moorcock has given the j and c initials , as a form of naming fil rouge ;
