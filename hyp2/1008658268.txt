dinitrogen tetroxide could be regarded as two nitro groups ( -no 2 ) bonded together it forms an equilibrium mixture with nitrogen dioxide the n-n distance corresponds to a weak bond , since it is significantly longer than the average n-n single bond length of 1.45Ã¥ inevitably , some dinitrogen tetroxide is a component of smog containing nitrogen dioxide nitrogen tetroxide is made by the catalytic oxidation of ammonia : steam is used as a diluent to reduce the combustion temperature dinitrogen tetroxide can also be made through the reaction of concentrated nitric acid and metallic copper the unstable species further react to form nitrogen dioxide which is then purified and condensed to form dinitrogen tetroxide nitrogen tetroxide is used as an oxidizer in one of the most important rocket propellants because it can be stored as a liquid at room temperature gemini and apollo spacecraft and also on the space shuttle , it continues to be used as station-keeping propellant on most geo-stationary satellites , and many deep-space probes when used as a propellant , dinitrogen tetroxide is usually referred to simply as nitrogen tetroxide and the abbreviation nto is extensively used '' cool '' dinitrogen tetroxide is compressed and heated , causing it to dissociate into nitrogen dioxide at half the molecular weight
