armadillo aerospace designed and built more than 12 vehicles which used about 50 engine designs for over 100 rocket flights armadillo stated a preference for simplicity and reliability over performance , which was evident in its choice of hydrogen peroxide ( 50 % concentration in water ) and methanol as a mixed monopropellant for the vehicle the quad vehicle design is pressure-fed in blow down mode from an initial pressure of 320 psi for level 1 ( 400 psi level 2 ) armadillo aerospace competed in the 2007 lunar lander challenge event in the wirefly x-prize cup 2007 texel crash video the vehicle was irreparably damaged , and only its sister pixel could compete in the upcoming event the plan was to have the first module ( of the next generation modular design ) compete at level 1 , and have pixel compete at level 2 challenge as the vehicle was still flying , carmack flew the crippled vehicle through the course as quickly as possible and hovered 2–3 meters above the landing pad the vehicle performed an auto-land , but the tilt caused the module to tip over on landing after only 82 seconds in the air on the final attempt , mod suffered a violent '' hard start '' , resulting in engine explosion the 2008 lunar lander challenge took place october 24–25 at the las cruces international airport in new mexico armadillo aerospace competed for the third year but for the first time had competition , from the truezer0 team armadillo successfully flew both legs with their mod vehicle , each flight lasting over 180 seconds , landing safely however their landing accuracy was not sufficient to win the first prize , instead they won the second prize while masten space systems ' xoie lander won the level 2 first prize in 2008 , the rocket racing league announced that armadillo aerospace engines would be used in a second generation of x-racer aircraft the third flight took place in january 2013 and the vehicle experienced a hard landing following a parachute failure-to-deploy , though the launch was good armadillo was headed , and largely funded , by john carmack , a developer of video games including the doom and quake series armadillo aerospace - news archive august 10 , 2010 the company mascot was an armadillo named widget in 2015 the assets of armadillo aerospace were sold to exos aerospace lutz kayser , the founding engineer of otrag , visited armadillo in may 2006 and loaned carmack some of their original research hardware
