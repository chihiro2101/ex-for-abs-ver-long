thumb the parabolic shape of a dish reflects the signal to the dish ’ s focal point direct broadcast satellite dishes use an lnbf , which integrates the feedhorn with the lnb a new form of omnidirectional satellite antenna , which does not use a directed parabolic dish and can be used on a mobile platform such as a vehicle was announced by the university of waterloo in 2004 the theoretical gain ( antenna gain ) of a dish increases as the frequency increases a typical value for a consumer type 60 & nbsp ; cm satellite dish at 11.75 & nbsp ; ghz is 37.50 & nbsp ; db the large size of dish required for lower frequencies led to the dishes being constructed from metal mesh on a metal framework at higher frequencies , mesh type designs are rarer though some designs have used a solid dish with perforations in the lnb they become down converted to 950–2150 & nbsp ; mhz , which is the frequency range allocated for the satellite service on the coaxial cable between lnbf and receiver thumb a satellite finder ( or sat finder ) is a satellite field strength meter used to accurately point satellite dishes at communications satellites in geostationary orbit motor-driven dishes come in a variety of sizes , but a dish of at least is required to receive signals from distant satellites which are intended to serve other areas however , some designs much more effectively optimize simultaneous reception from multiple different satellite positions without re-positioning the dish automatic tracking satellite dish satellitedish1.jpg general electric satellite dish for directv satellite television only modern low noise lnbs and the higher transmission power of dth satellites allows a usable signal to be received from such inefficient diy antennas parabolic antennas referred to as '' dish '' antennas had been in use long before satellite television this was the first widely used direct-broadcast satellite television system and allowed dishes as small as 20 & nbsp ; inches to be used this great decrease of dish size also allowed satellite dishes to be installed on vehicles
