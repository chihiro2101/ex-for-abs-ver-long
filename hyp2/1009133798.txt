nearby evidence within wonderwerk cave , at the edge of the kalahari desert , has been called the oldest known controlled fire microscopic analysis of plant ash and charred bone fragments suggests that materials in the cave were not heated above about this is consistent with preliminary findings that the fires burned grasses , brush , and leaves if a fire ring is not available , a temporary fire site may be constructed bare rock or unvegetated ground is ideal for a fire site another way is to cover the ground with sand , or other soil mostly free of flammable organic material , to a depth of a few inches fire rings , however , do not fully protect material on the ground from catching fire having enough water nearby and a shovel to smother an out-of-control fire with dirt be aware of roots if digging a hole for your fire making sure the fire pit is large enough for the campfire and there are no combustibles near the campfire , and avoiding the construction of the campfire on a windy day tinder lights easily and is used to start an enduring campfire kindling wood is an arbitrary classification including anything bigger than tinder but smaller than fuel wood in fact , there are gradations of kindling , from sticks thinner than a finger to those as thick as a wrist timber ranges from small logs two or three inches ( 76 & nbsp ; mm ) across to larger logs that can burn for hours in heavily used campsites , fuel wood can be hard to find , so it may have to purchased at a nearby store or be brought from home however , untreated wood should not be transported due to the probability that invasive species of bugs will be transported with it heat-treated wood such as kiln-dried lumber is safe to transport the tipi ( or teepee ) fire-build takes some patience to construct the smaller kindling is arranged around it , like the poles of a tipi tipi fires are excellent for producing heat to keep people warm the gases from the bottom quickly come to the top as you add more sticks a log cabin fire-build likewise begins with a tinder pile however , these qualities make the log cabin an ideal cooking fire as it burns for a long period of time and can support cookware the tinder is lit , and the kindling is allowed to catch fire when it is burning briskly , it is broken and pushed down into the consumed tinder , and the larger kindling is placed over the top of the logs its main difference from the standard log cabin is that it starts with thin pieces and moves up to thick pieces a hybrid fire combines the elements of both the tipi and the log cabin creating an easily lit yet stable fire structure the hybrid is made by first erecting a small tipi and then proceeding to construct a log cabin around it once the fire is burning well , additional pieces of wood are placed on top in layers that alternate directions then , a long , thick piece of kindling is driven into the ground at an angle , so that it overhangs the tinder pile the small tipi is lighted on top , and the coals eventually fall down into the log cabin a star fire , or indian fire , is the fire design often depicted as the campfire of the old west someone lays six or so logs out like the spokes of a wheel ( star-shaped ) the tinder burns brightly , but reduced to glowing embers within half a minute another technique is to use pie ironsâ€”small iron molds with long handles the water boils violently and carries ash in the air with it , dirtying anything nearby but not posing a safety hazard campfire ashes are sometimes used in ceremonies like the campfire ash ceremony
