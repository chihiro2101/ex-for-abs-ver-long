application of ccpm has been credited with achieving projects 10 % to 50 % faster and/or cheaper than the traditional methods ( i.e harvey maylor , project management in a project plan , the critical chain is the sequence of both precedence- and resource-dependent tasks that prevents a project from being completed in a shorter time , given finite resources if resources are always available in unlimited quantities , then a project 's critical chain is identical to its critical path method main features that distinguish critical chain from critical path are : use of ( often implicit ) resource dependencies implicit means that they are not included in the project network , but must be identified by looking at the resource requirements critical chain project management uses buffer management instead of earned value management to assess the performance of a project , on the critical chain ) from progress on non-constraints ( i.e a project plan or work breakdown structure ( wbs ) is created in much the same fashion as with critical path the longest sequence of resource-leveled tasks that lead from beginning to end of the project is then identified as the critical chain the '' extra '' duration of each task on the critical chain—the difference between the '' safe '' durations and the 50 % durations—is gathered in a buffer at the end of the project when the plan is complete and the project is ready to start , the project network is fixed and the buffers ' sizes are '' locked '' ( i.e the ccpm literature contrasts this with '' traditional '' project management that monitors task start and completion dates
