succinylcholine chloride injection indicated , in addition to general anesthesia , to facilitate tracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation it is popular in emergency medicine due to its rapid onset and brief duration of action the former is a major point of consideration in the context of trauma care , where endotracheal intubation may need to be completed very quickly the latter means that , should attempts at endotracheal intubation fail and the person can not be ventilator , there is a prospect for neuromuscular recovery and the onset of spontaneous breathing before hypoxemia occurs suxamethonium is also commonly used as the sole muscle relaxant during electroconvulsive therapy , favoured for its short duration of action suxamethonium is quickly degraded by plasma butyrylcholinesterase and the duration of effect is usually in the range of a few minutes in people with neuromuscular disease or burns , an injection of suxamethonium can lead to a large release of potassium from skeletal muscles , potentially resulting in cardiac arrest suxamethonium does not produce unconsciousness or anesthesia , and its effects may cause considerable psychological distress while simultaneously making it impossible for a patient to communicate the side effect of high blood potassium may occur because the acetylcholine receptor is propped open , allowing continued flow of potassium ions into the extracellular fluid malignant hyperthermia ( mh ) from suxamethonium administration can result in a drastic and uncontrolled increase in skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism in normal skeletal muscle , acetylcholine dissociates from the receptor following depolarization and is rapidly hydrolyzed by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase calcium is removed from the muscle cell cytoplasm independent of repolarization ( depolarization signaling and muscle contraction are independent processes ) it is caused by the blood concentration of suxamethonium exceeding the therapeutic window when studying the drug , animals were given curare and thus they missed the neuromuscular blocking properties of suxamethonium
