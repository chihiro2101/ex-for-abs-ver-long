by 1403 only a handful of castles , including harlech , still stood against the rebels , but the castle was under-equipped and under-staffed to withstand a siege , the garrison having just three shields , eight helmets , six lances , ten pairs of gloves , and four guns harlech became his residence , family home and military headquarters for four years ; he held his second parliament in harlech in august 1405 when this failed to take the castle , henry left john talbot in charge of the siege and moved on to deal with aberystwyth castle in 1460 , following the battle of northampton , queen margaret of anjou fled to the castle and between 1461â€“68 it was held by her lancastrian supporters , under the command of dafydd ap ieuan , against the yorkist edward iv harlech apparently had not been repaired following the 1468 siege , and had become completely dilapidated , with the exception of the gatehouse , which was used for the local assizes the orders were only partially carried out , however , and the gatehouse staircases were destroyed and the castle rendered generally unusable , but it was not totally demolished harlech castle rests upon part of the rhinogydd , a spur of rock almost high ; the land falls away sharply on the north and west , and a ditch cut into the rock protects the remaining approaches to the castle the castle has a concentric castle , with one line of defences enclosed by another , forming an inner and outer ward ; the outer wall was originally somewhat taller than today the links between the harlech and savoy are not straightforward , however , as in some cases the relevant savoy structures were built after james had left the region official cadw page for harlech castle
