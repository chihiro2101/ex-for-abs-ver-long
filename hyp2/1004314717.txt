although notionally independent , it was effectively under the control of the don navigation when it opened , probably in 1802 the dearne and dove canal was also authorised in 1793 , from swinton to barnsley , and was again under don navigation control , since most of the shareholders were also shareholders in the don a canal from tinsley into sheffield was delayed for years by opposition from the don navigation , but was authorised in 1815 and opened in 1819 they bought out the dearne and dove canal in 1846 , and acquired the sheffield canal from the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway in 1848 , which , as the sheffield and lincolnshire junction railway , a predecessor and constituent company , had bought it in 1846 they then amalgamated with the south yorkshire , doncaster and goole railway in 1850 , to become the south yorkshire railway and river dun company with the manchester ship canal under construction , and other large canals being proposed , a committee was formed to investigate a new canal from sheffield to the sea t & c hawksley , assisted by james abernethy , were asked to report on whether a canal from sheffield suitable for medium-sized coasters could be built , to the ouse , the trent or the humber the estimated cost of this work , which included a new canal from tinsley to sheffield , but did not include buying the canals from the railway company , was put at Â£1 & nbsp ; million they could also improve the canals they bought , or build new ones , and could also act as inland carriers in addition , the dearne and dove canal would be dredged , so that tom pudding , like those on the aire and calder , could be used for the transport of coal the rest could be paid in shares in the new company , which would give the railway places on the board unless the canal company bought all of the shares back despite the lack of capital , the new company somehow managed to finance improvements to sheffield basin , including a four-storey warehouse which straddled part of the basin they were also faced with the prospect of funding their half of the new junction canal , to provide the connection with the aire and calder navigation today the system is open to navigation throughout the main line , the stainforth and keadby and new junction canals , and is mostly used for leisure boating a canal restoration group is also seeking the re-opening of the dearne and dove canal , has performed some restoration work at elsecar and commissioned an engineer 's report into reopening
