although usually not cost-effective , glycerol can be produced by various routes from propene chlorine-free processes from propylene include the synthesis of glycerol from acrolein and propylene oxide : because of the large-scale production of biodiesel from fats , where glycerol is a waste product , the market for glycerol is depressed owing to oversupply , efforts are being made to convert glycerol to synthetic precursors , such as acrolein and epichlorohydrin in food and beverages , glycerol serves as a humectant , solvent , and sweetener , and may help preserve foods glycerol and water are used to preserve certain types of plant leaves as a sugar substitute , it has approximately 27 food energy per teaspoon ( sugar has 20 ) and is 60 % as sweet as sucrose it does not feed the bacteria that form plaques and cause dental cavities as a food additive , glycerol is labeled as e number e422 food and drug administration ( fda ) carbohydrate designation includes all caloric macronutrients excluding protein and fat due to this it is used widely in wound care products , including glycerin based hydrogel sheets for burns and other wound care there is no topical treatment approved for third degree burns , and so this limitation is not exclusive to glycerin in solid dosage forms like tablets , glycerol is used as a tablet holding agent glycerol is also used in blood banking to preserve red blood cells prior to freezing this kind of soap is used by people with sensitive , easily irritated skin because it prevents skin dryness with its moisturizer properties taken orally ( often mixed with fruit juice to reduce its sweet taste ) , glycerol can cause a rapid , temporary decrease in the intraocular pressure glycerol has also been incorporated as a component of bio-ink formulations in the field of bioprinting the glycerol content acts to add viscosity to the bio-ink without adding large protein , carbohydrate , or glycoprotein molecules fluid extract manufacturers often extract herbs in hot water before adding glycerol to make glycerites that glycerol possesses such high extractive power assumes it is utilized with dynamic ( i.e both glycerol and ethanol are viable preserving agents in the laboratory , glycerol is a common component of solvents for enzyme reagents stored at temperatures below 0 & nbsp ; °c due to the freezing-point depression glycerol is used by the film industry when filming scenes involving water to stop areas from drying out too quickly when the body uses stored fat as a source of energy , glycerol and fatty acids are released into the bloodstream blood glycerol levels in diabetic patients average three times higher than healthy controls between 1990 and 1998 , incidents of deg poisoning reportedly occurred in argentina , bangladesh , india , and nigeria , and resulted in hundreds of deaths mass spectrum of glycerol cdc – niosh pocket guide to chemical hazards – glycerin ( mist )
