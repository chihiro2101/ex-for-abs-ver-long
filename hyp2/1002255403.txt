the first practical large-scale application of stratigraphy was by william smith in the 1790s and early 19th century known as the '' father of english geology '' , smith recognized the significance of strata or rock layering and the importance of fossil markers for correlating strata ; he created the first geologic map of england other influential applications of stratigraphy in the early 19th century were by georges cuvier and alexandre brongniart , who studied the geology of the region around paris these variations provide a lithostratigraphy or lithologic stratigraphy of the rock unit key concepts in stratigraphy involve understanding how certain geometric relationships between rock layers arise and what these geometries imply about their original depositional environment biostratigraphy or paleontology stratigraphy is based on fossil evidence in the rock layers strata from widespread locations containing the same fossil fauna and flora are said to be correlatable in time biologic stratigraphy was based on william smith 's principle of faunal succession , which predated , and was one of the first and most powerful lines of evidence for , biological evolution the geologic time scale was developed during the 19th century , based on the evidence of biologic stratigraphy and faunal succession stratigraphy is also commonly used to delineate the nature and extent of hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir rocks , seals , and traps of petroleum geology chronostratigraphy is the branch of stratigraphy that places an absolute age , rather than a relative age on rock strata the branch is concerned with deriving geochronology data for rock units , both directly and inferentially , so that a sequence of time-relative events that created the rocks formation can be derived
