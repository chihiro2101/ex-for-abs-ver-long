the genus lynx shares a clade with the genetic lineages puma , prionailurus and felis dated to ; lynx diverged approximately the first wave moved into the southern portion of north america , which was soon cut off from the north by glaciers a second population arrived from asia and settled in the north , developing into the modern canada lynx blynx may sometimes occur 13 bobcat subspecies have been historically recognized based on morphological characteristics : l rufus ( schreber ) – eastern and midwestern united states l gigas ( bangs ) – northern new york to nova scotia and new brunswick l floridanus ( rafinesque ) – southeastern united states and inland to the mississippi valley , up to southwestern missouri and southern illinois l superiorensis ( peterson & downing ) – western great lakes area , including upper michigan , wisconsin , southern ontario , and most of minnesota l baileyi ( merriam ) – southwestern united states and northwestern mexico l mohavensis ( b.anderson ) – mojave desert of california l allen ) – central mexico , with a northern extension along the west coast to southern sonora l fasciatus ( rafinesque ) – oregon , washington west of the cascade range , northwestern california , and southwestern british columbia l the bobcat resembles other species of the midsize genus lynx , but is on average the smallest of the four a few melanism bobcats have been sighted and captured in florida , usa and new brunswick , canada the face appears wide due to ruffs of extended hair beneath the ears however , cases of bobcats swimming long distances across lakes have been recorded adult males can range in weight from , with an average of ; females at , with an average of furthermore , a june 20 , 2012 report of a new hampshire roadkill specimen listed the animal 's weight at the bobcat is muscular , and its hind legs are longer than its front legs , giving it a somewhat irregular gait the cat is larger in its northern range and in open habitats a morphological size comparison study in the eastern united states found a divergence in the location of the largest male and female specimens , suggesting differing natural selection for the sexes it keeps on the move from three hours before sunset until about midnight , and then again from before dawn until three hours after sunrise the sizes of bobcats ' home ranges vary significantly ; a world conservation union ( iucn ) summary of research suggests ranges from one study in kansas found resident males to have ranges of roughly , and females less than half that area transient bobcats were found to have both larger ( roughly and less well-defined home ranges other research in various american states has shown little or no seasonal variation unusual for cats , males are more tolerant of overlap , while females rarely wander into others ' ranges when multiple territories overlap , a dominance hierarchy is often established , resulting in the exclusion of some transients from favored areas in line with widely differing estimates of home range size , population density figures are divergent , from one to 38 bobcats per in one survey the average is estimated at one bobcat per one study noted a dense , unhunted population in california had a sex ratio of 2.1 males per female the bobcat is able to survive for long periods without food , but eats heavily when prey is abundant during lean periods , it often preys on larger animals , which it can kill and return to feed on later the bobcat hunts by stalking its prey and then ambushing with a short chase or pounce its main prey varies by region : in the eastern united states , it is the eastern cottontail and new england cottontail , and in the north , it is the snowshoe hare in the far south , the rabbits and hares are sometimes replaced by cotton rats as the primary food source diet diversification positively correlates to a decline in numbers of the bobcat 's principal prey ; the abundance of its main prey species is the main determinant of overall diet while larger species , such as cattle , and horses , are not known to be attacked , bobcats do present a threat to smaller ruminants , such as pigs , sheep and goats on the rare occasions a bobcat kills a deer , it eats its fill and then buries the carcass under snow or leaves , often returning to it several times to feed bobcats generally begin mating by their second summer , though females may start as early as their first year other males may be in attendance , but remain uninvolved once the male recognizes the female is receptive , he grasps her in the typical felid neck grip and mates with her during courtship , the otherwise silent bobcat may let out loud screams , hisses , or other sounds the bobcat may have external parasites , mostly ticks and fleas , and often carries the parasites of its prey , especially those of rabbits and squirrels it ranges from the humid swamps of florida to desert lands of texas or rugged mountain areas as a result , the rate of bobcat deaths is skewed in winter , when hunting season is generally open for bobcats , preserving open space in sufficient quantities and quality is necessary for population viability european colonizers to the americas also admired the cat , both for its ferocity and its grace , and in the united states , it '' rests prominently in the anthology of & nbsp ;
