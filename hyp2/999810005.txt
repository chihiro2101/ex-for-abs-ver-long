thumb modern mmus typically divide the virtual address space ( the range of addresses used by the processor ) into pages , each having a size which is a power of 2 , usually a few kilobytes , but they may be much larger other mmus may have a private array of memory or registers that hold a set of page table entries sometimes , a pte prohibits access to a virtual page , perhaps because no physical random access memory has been allocated to that virtual page the operating system ( os ) then handles the situation , perhaps by trying to find a spare frame of ram and set up a new pte to map it to the requested virtual address if no ram is free , it may be necessary to choose an existing page ( known as a '' victim '' ) , using some replacement algorithm , and save it to disk ( a process called '' paging '' ) with some mmus , there can also be a shortage of ptes , in which case the os will have to free one for the new mapping after blocks of memory have been allocated and freed , the free memory may become fragmented ( discontinuous ) so that the largest contiguous block of free memory may be much smaller than the total amount while this article concentrates on modern mmus , commonly based on pages , early systems used a similar concept for base-limit addressing that further developed into segmentation the x86 architecture provided segmentation , rather than paging , in the 80286 , and provides both paging and segmentation in the 80386 and later processors ( although the use of segmentation is not available in 64-bit operation ) most modern systems divide memory into pages that are in size , often with the capability to use so called huge pages of or in size ( often both variants are possible ) page translations are cached in a translation lookaside buffer ( tlb ) some systems , mainly older risc designs , trap into the os when a page translation is not found in the tlb most systems allow the mmu to be disabled , but some disable the mmu when trapping into os code ; p1 space : ( or control space ) which is also per-process and is typically used for supervisor , executive , kernel , user stacks and other per-process control structures managed by the operating system ; s0 space : ( or system space ) which is global to all processes and stores operating system code and data , whether paged or not , including pagetables thus , there is effectively a two-level tree , allowing applications to have sparse memory layout without wasting a lot of space on unused page table entries oses which implement paging must find some way to emulate the accessed bit if they are to operate efficiently tlb updates are performed automatically by page table walking hardware ptes include read/write access permission based on privilege , cacheability information , an nx bit , and a non-secure bit it has the unusual feature of storing accessed and dirty bits outside of the page table ( along with the four bit protection key for all s/360 processors ) the number of tlb entries is configurable at cpu configuration before synthesis a vpn2 has a global status bit and an os assigned id which participates in the virtual address tlb entry match , if the global status bit is set to zero the original sun 1 is a single-board computer built around the motorola 68000 microprocessor and introduced in 1982 it includes the original sun 1 memory management unit that provides address translation , memory protection , memory sharing and memory allocation for multiple processes running on the cpu the 4-bit context register can switch between 16 sections of the segment map under supervisor control , which allows 16 contexts to be mapped concurrently additional contexts can be handled by treating the segment map as a context cache and replacing out-of-date contexts on a least-recently used basis interrupts and traps do not switch contexts , which requires that all valid interrupt vectors always be mapped in page 0 of context , as well as the valid supervisor stack the other lookup , not directly supported by all processors in this family , is via a so-called '' inverted page table , '' which acts as a hashed off-chip extension of the tlb the os needs to discard an entry from the hash table to make space for a new entry on chips that make this optional or do not support it at all , the os may choose to use a tree-based page table exclusively normal operation of the traditional 80386 cpu and its successors ( ia-32 ) is described here in addition , the page attribute table allowed specification of cacheability by looking up a few high bits in a small on-cpu table the virtual addresses are divided as follows : 16 bits unused , nine bits each for four tree levels ( for a total of 36 bits ) , and the 12 lowest bits directly copied to the result in all levels of the page table , the page table entry includes a nx bit bit copy descriptors contain a 20-bit address field giving index of the master descriptor in the master descriptor array
