toad ramsey of the louisville colonels in the old american association—his pitch likely resembled the knuckle curve—and eddie cicotte of the chicago white sox , who in 1908 was nicknamed '' knuckles '' , are two possible creators of the pitch image : eddiecicotte55.jpg right thumb 167px eddie cicotte , who is sometimes credited with inventing the knuckleball as used by cicotte , the knuckleball was originally thrown by holding the ball with the knuckles , hence the name of the pitch ed summers , a pittsburgh teammate of cicotte who adopted the pitch and helped develop it , modified it by holding the ball with his fingertips and using the thumb for balance the fingertip grip is more commonly used today by knuckleball pitchers , like retired boston red sox pitcher tim wakefield , who had a knuckleball with a lot of movement there are other prominent knuckleball pitchers like hall of famer phil niekro , who had a very effective knuckler and knuckle curve , and cy young award winning pitcher r.a sometimes young players will throw the knuckleball with their knuckles flat against the ball , giving it less spin but also making it difficult to throw any significant distance regardless of how the ball is gripped , the purpose of the knuckleball is to have the least possible amount of rotational spin created by the act of throwing a ball , the ball 's trajectory is significantly affected by variations in airflow caused by differences between the smooth surface of the ball and the stitching of its seams over the distance from the pitcher 's mound to home plate , the effect of these forces is that the knuckleball can flutter , dance , jiggle , or curve in two different directions during its flight the ball completes between one-quarter and one-half a rotation on its way from the pitcher to the batter ; the position of the stitches changes as the ball travels , affecting the drag that gives the ball its motion , thus making its flight erratic even a ball thrown without rotation will '' flutter '' , due to the '' apparent wind '' it feels as its trajectory changes throughout its flight path according to physicist robert adair , due to the physiological limitation of human reaction time , a breaking knuckleball may be impossible to hit except by luck if a knuckleball does not change direction in mid-flight , however , then it is easy to hit due to its lack of speed ) since it typically only travels , far slower than the average major league fastball , it can be hit very hard if there is no movement to reduce the chances of having the knuckleball get hit for a home run , some pitchers will impart a slight topspin so that if no force causes the ball to dance , it will move downward in flight this is due to both the knuckleball 's low average speed and its erratic movement , which force the catcher to keep focusing on the ball even after the runners start stealing their next bases however , cicotte called the shine ball '' a pure freak of the imagination '' , claiming that he did this to disconcert hitters and that the pitch was still a knuckleball the knuckle curve has a somewhat similar name because of the grip used to throw it ( also with the knuckles or fingernails ) , but it is generally thrown harder and with spin many current pitchers throw a curveball using a grip with the index finger touching the ball with the knuckle or fingertip ( also called a spike curve ) because the speed of any prospect 's pitch is one of the quickest and easiest metrics in judging the skill of the prospect , the knuckleball , which is thrown slower than any other pitch , gets overlooked additionally , ted lyons , another member of the hall of fame , relied heavily on the knuckleball after injuring his arm in 1931 when originally developed , the knuckleball was used by a number of pitchers as simply one pitch in their repertoire , usually as part of changing speeds from their fastball knuckleball pitchers can throw more innings than other pitchers , and , requiring less time to recover after pitching , can pitch more frequently the '' knuckleball catcher '' is equipped with an oversized knuckleball catcher 's mitt , similar to a first baseman 's glove ; doug mirabelli , formerly of the red sox , used a softball catcher 's mitt in association football or soccer , the method of striking the ball so that it produces almost no spinning motion during its flight has been colloquially described as '' knuckleballing '' by commentators , due to the ball 's motion that resembles a baseball thrown with a knuckleball pitch this technique has also been used and even adapted by several other players , such as andrea pirlo , ronaldinho , cristiano ronaldo , didier drogba , and gareth bale
