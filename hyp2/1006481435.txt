data general ( dg ) was founded by several engineers from digital equipment corporation who were frustrated with dec 's management and left to form their own company the chief founders were edson de castro , henry burkhardt iii , and richard sogge of digital equipment ( dec ) , and herbert richman of fairchild semiconductor edson de castro was the chief engineer in charge of the pdp-8 , dec 's line of inexpensive computers that created the minicomputer market it was designed specifically to be used in laboratory equipment settings ; as the technology improved , it was reduced in size to fit into a 19-inch rack de castro was watching developments in manufacturing , especially more complex printed circuit boards ( pcbs ) and wave soldering that suggested that the pdp-8 could be greatly cost-reduced convinced he could do one better , de castro began work on his own low-cost 16-bit design it lacked general registers and the stack-pointer functionality of the more advanced pdp-11 , as did competing products , such as the hp 2100 ; compilers used hardware-based memory locations in lieu of a stack pointer designed to be rack-mounted similarly to the later pdp-8 machines , it was packaged on four pcb cards and was thus smaller in height , while also including a number of features that made it run considerably faster announced as '' the best small computer in the world '' , the nova quickly gained a following , especially in scientific and educational markets , and made the company flush with cash based on many of the same concepts as the nova , it included support for virtual memory and multitasking more suitable to the small office environment production problems with the eclipse led to a rash of lawsuits in the late 1970s newer versions of the machine were pre-ordered by many of dg 's customers , which were never delivered the eclipse was originally intended to replace the nova outright , evidenced by the fact that the nova 3 series , released at the same time and utilizing virtually the same internal architecture as the eclipse , was phased out the next year while dg was still struggling with eclipse , in 1977 , digital announced the vax series , their first 32-bit minicomputer line , described as '' super-minis '' this coincided with the ageing 16-bit products , notably the pdp-11 , which were coming due for replacement development took place off-site so that even dg workers would not know of it the developers were given free rein over the design and selected a system that used a writable instruction set through the early 1980s sales picked up , and by 1984 the company had over a billion dollars in annual sales one of data general 's significant customers at this time was the united states forest service , which starting in the mid-1980s used dg systems installed at all levels from headquarters in washington , d.c this required equipment of high reliability and generally rugged construction that could be deployed in a wide range of places , often to be maintained and used by people with no computer background at all the introduction , implementation , and effects of the dg systems in usfs were documented in a series of evaluative reports prepared in the late 1980s by the rand corporation the mv series came in various iterations , from the mv/2000 ( later mv/2500 ) , mv/4000 , mv/10000 , mv/15000 , mv/20000 , mv/30000 , mv/40000 and ultimately concluded with the mv/60000ha minicomputer yet , there were failures among the system 's many daughter boards , back-plane , and mid-plane dg technicians were kept quite busy replacing boards and many blamed poor quality control at the dg factory in mexico where they were made and refurbished while the mv series did stop the erosion of dg 's customer base , this now smaller base was no longer large enough to allow dg to develop their next generation the aos/vs software was the most commonly used dg software product and included cli ( command line interpreter ) allowing for complex scripting , dump/load , and other custom components ceowrite was also offered on the dg one portable pln ( created by robert nichols ) was the host language for a number of dg products , making them easier to develop , enhance , and maintain than macro assembler equivalents the rpg product ( shipped in 1976 ) incorporated a language runtime system implemented as a virtual machine which executed pre-compiled code as sequences of pln statements and eclipse commercial instruction routines the latter provided microcode acceleration of arithmetic and conversion operations for a wide range of now-arcane data types such as overpunch characters the dg easy product , a portable application platform developed by nichols and others from 1975 to 1979 but never marketed , had roots easily traceable back to the rpg vm created by stephen schleimer also notable were several commercial software products developed in the mid to late 1970s in conjunction with the commercial computers the first product was idea ( interactive data entry/access ) , which consisted of a screen design tool ( ifmt ) , tp controller ( imon ) , and a program development language ( ifpl ) if this was not the case at present , it certainly appeared it would be within a generation or two of moore 's law in an effort to keep costs down , the aviion was originally designed and shipped with the motorola 88000 risc processor the lack of lock-in now came back to haunt dg , and the rapid commoditization of the unix market led to shrinking sales data general would be only one of many new england based computer companies , including the original digital equipment corporation , that collapsed or were sold to larger companies after the 1980s groove networks was acquired by microsoft in 2005 , and ozzie replaced bill gates as chief software architect at microsoft from 2006 until 2010 asher waldfogel was a software engineer in special systems ( software ) who later went on to found redback networks , tollbridge technologies and peakstream edward zander was product marketing manager at data general before his positions at apollo computer , sun microsystems and motorola as ceo
