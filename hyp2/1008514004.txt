macrophages that reside in adult healthy tissues either derive from circulating monocytes or are established before birth and then maintained during adult life independently of monocytes by contrast , most of the macrophages that accumulate at diseased sites typically derive from circulating monocytes when a monocyte enters damaged tissue through the endothelium of a blood vessel , a process known as leukocyte extravasation , it undergoes a series of changes to become a macrophage unlike short-lived neutrophils , macrophages survive longer in the body , up to several months file : phagocytosis zp.svg thumb right 400px steps of a macrophage ingesting a pathogen : a the fusion of lysosomes with the phagosome creates a phagolysosome ; the pathogen is broken down by enzymes c the neutrophils are at first attracted to a site , where they perform their function and die , before they are phagocytized by the macrophages when at the site , the first wave of neutrophils , after the process of aging and after the first 48 hours , stimulate the appearance of the macrophages whereby these macrophages will then ingest the aged neutrophils when a macrophage ingests a pathogen , the pathogen becomes trapped in a phagosome , which then fuses with a lysosome typhoidal salmonellae induce their own phagocytosis by host macrophages in vivo , and inhibit digestion by lysosomal action , thereby using macrophages for their own replication and causing macrophage apoptosis as scavengers , they rid the body of worn-out cells and other debris along with dendritic cells , they are foremost among the cells that present antigens , a crucial role in initiating an immune response at the same time , they carry receptors for lymphokines that allow them to be '' activated '' into single-minded pursuit of microbes and tumour cells after digesting a pathogen , a macrophage will present the antigen ( a molecule , most often a protein found on the surface of the pathogen and used by the immune system for identification ) of the pathogen to the corresponding helper t cell eventually , the antigen presentation results in the production of antibody that attach to the antigens of pathogens , making them easier for macrophages to adhere to with their cell membrane and phagocytose when a b-cell in the lymph node recognizes the same unprocessed surface antigen on the bacterium with its surface bound antibody , the antigen is endocytosed and processed in spite of a spectrum of ways to activate macrophages , there are two main groups designated m1 and m2 m1 macrophages : as mentioned earlier ( previously referred to as classically activated macrophages ) , m1 '' killer '' macrophages are activated by lps and ifn-gamma , and secrete high levels of il-12 and low levels of il-10 m2 macrophages produce high levels of il-10 , tgf-beta and low levels of il-12 macrophages exist in a variety of phenotypes which are determined by the role they play in wound maturation m1 macrophages are the dominating phenotype observed in the early stages of inflammation and are activated by four key mediators : interferon-γ ( ifn-γ ) , tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) , and damage associated molecular patterns ( damps ) these mediator molecules create a pro-inflammatory response that in return produce pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 and tnf unlike m1 macrophages , m2 macrophages secrete an anti-inflammatory response via the addition of interleukin-4 or interleukin-13 how m2 phenotypes are determined is still up for discussion but studies have shown that their environment allows them to adjust to whichever phenotype is most appropriate to efficiently heal the wound with a lack of these growth factors/anti-inflammatory cytokines and an overabundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines from m1 macrophages chronic wounds are unable to heal in a timely manner at this point , inflammation is not needed and m1 undergoes a switch to m2 ( anti-inflammatory ) however , dysregulation occurs as the m1 macrophages are unable/do not phagocytose neutrophils that have undergone apoptosis leading to increased macrophage migration and inflammation m2 & nbsp ; macrophages can remove cholesterol from blood vessels , but when the cholesterol is oxidized , the m2 & nbsp ; macrophages become apoptosis foam cells contributing to the atheroma of atherosclerosis the initial wave is a phagocytic population that comes along during periods of increased muscle use that are sufficient to cause muscle membrane lysis and membrane inflammation , which can enter and degrade the contents of injured muscle fibers these early-invading , phagocytic macrophages reach their highest concentration about 24 hours following the onset of some form of muscle cell injury or reloading the second group is the non-phagocytic types that are distributed near regenerative fibers attracted to the wound site by growth factors released by platelets and other cells , monocytes from the bloodstream enter the area through blood vessel walls melanophages are a subset of tissue-resident macrophages able to absorb pigment , either native to the organism or exogenous ( such as tattoos ) , from extracellular space diseases with this type of behaviour include tuberculosis ( caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis ) and leishmaniasis ( caused by leishmania species ) some tumors can also produce factors , including m-csf/csf1 , ccl2 and angiotensin ii , that trigger the amplification and mobilization of macrophages in tumors though very similar in structure to tissue macrophages , intestinal macrophages have evolved specific characteristics and functions given their natural environment , which is in the digestive tract whereas tissue macrophages release various inflammatory cytokines , such as il-1 , il-6 and tnf-α , intestinal macrophages do not produce or secrete inflammatory cytokines intestinal macrophages have been shown to play a role in inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) , such as crohn 's disease ( cd ) and ulcerative colitis ( uc ) file : s4-j774 cells with conidia in liquid media.ogg an active j774 macrophage is seen taking up four conidia in a co-operative manner
