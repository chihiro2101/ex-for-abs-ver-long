the investigation of the nucleus was done by three optical spectrometers , one microwave radio antenna and one radar : alice ( an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ) the ultraviolet spectroscopy searched for and quantified the noble gas content in the comet nucleus , from which the temperature during the comet creation could be estimated the instrument used 2.9 watts , with an improved version onboard new horizons the camera system had a narrow-angle lens ( 700 & nbsp ; mm ) and a wide-angle lens ( 140 & nbsp ; mm ) , with a 2048×2048 pixel ccd chip the visible and ir spectrometer was able to make pictures of the nucleus in the ir and also search for ir spectra of molecules in the coma the detection was done by a mercury cadmium telluride array for ir and with a ccd chip for the visible spectrum range the instrument was produced in italy , and improved versions were used for dawn and venus express the abundance and temperature of volatile substances like water , ammonia and carbon dioxide could be detected by miro via their microwave emissions consert ( comet nucleus sounding experiment by radiowave transmission ) the radar performed tomography of the nucleus by measuring electromagnetic wave propagation between the philae lander and the rosetta orbiter through the comet nucleus rsi made use of the probe 's communication system for physical investigation of the nucleus and the inner coma of the comet the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) has contributed to the deveplopment and construction of the instrument cosima was built by the max planck institute for extraterrestrial physics ( mpe , germany ) with international contributions the cosima team is led by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps , germany ) these are the elements that make up nucleic acids and amino acids , essential ingredients for life as we know it before succumbing to falling power levels , philae cosac instrument was able to detect organic molecules in the comet 's atmosphere the supernova could wipe out one type of molecules while also flinging the other surviving molecules into space , where they could eventually end up on a planet the mission has yielded a significant science return , collecting a wealth of data from the nucleus and its environment at various levels of cometary activity in turn , the philae lander 's cosac instrument detected organic molecules in the comet 's atmosphere as it descended to its surface the only amino acid detected thus far on the comet is glycine , along with the precursor molecules methylamine and ethylamine ; 2004 2 march – rosetta was successfully launched at 07:17 utc ( 04:17 local time ) from kourou , french guiana ; 2005 4 march – rosetta executed its first planned close swing-by ( gravity assist passage ) of earth 14 july – the osiris on-board imaging system returned images of comet 67p which confirmed the irregular shape of the comet 10 december 2014 – data from the rosina mass spectrometers show that the ratio of heavy water to normal water on comet 67p is more than three times that on earth file : chasing a comet - the rosetta mission.webm about rosetta mission ( 9 min , 1080p hd , english ) file : landing on a comet - the rosetta mission.webm about philae landing ( 10 min
