the first known christmas hymns may be traced to 4th-century rome latin hymns such as veni redemptor gentium , written by ambrose , archbishop of milan , were austere statements of the theological doctrine of the incarnation in opposition to arianism 32 in the 9th and 10th centuries , the christmas '' sequence '' or '' prose '' was introduced in northern european monasteries , developing under bernard of clairvaux into a sequence of rhymed stanzas in the 12th century the parisian monk adam of saint victor began to derive music from popular songs , introducing something closer to the traditional christmas carol in the 13th century , in france , germany , and particularly , italy , under the influence of francis of assisi a strong tradition of popular christmas songs in regional native languages developed 31–37 christmas carols in english first appear in a 1426 work of john awdlay , a shropshire chaplain , who lists twenty five '' caroles of cristemas '' , probably sung by groups of 'wassailing ' , who went from house to house 47–48 the songs now known specifically as carols were originally communal songs sung during celebrations like harvest tide as well as christmas it was only later that carols began to be sung in church , and to be specifically associated with christmas early , latin forms of carols such as '' christ was born on christmas day '' , '' good christian men , rejoice '' and '' good king wenceslas '' can be found in this book '' adeste fideles '' ( '' o come all ye faithful '' ) appears in its current form in the mid-18th century , although the words may have originated in the 13th century carols gained in popularity after the reformation in the countries where protestant churches gained prominence ( as well-known reformers like martin luther authored carols and encouraged their use in worship ) composers such as arthur sullivan helped to repopularise the carol , and it is this period that gave rise to such favourites as '' good king wenceslas '' and '' it came upon the midnight clear '' , a new england carol written by edmund h in 1916 , charles lewis hutchins published carols old and carols new , a scholarly collection which suffered from a short print run and is consequently rarely available today the singing of carols was further popularised in the 20th century when oup published one of the most popular carol books in the english-speaking world , carols for choirs today carols are regularly sung at christian religious services for example , the 16th-century song '' a bone , god wot ! '' appears to be a wassailing song ( which is sung during drinking or while requesting ale ) , but is described in the british library 's cottonian collection as a christmas carol as recently as 1865 , christmas-related lyrics were adopted for the traditional english folk song greensleeves , becoming the internationally popular christmas carol '' what child is this ? '' traditionally , carols have often been based on medieval chord patterns , and it is this that gives them their uniquely characteristic musical sound some carols like '' personent hodie '' , '' good king wenceslas '' , and '' the holly and the ivy '' can be traced directly back to the middle ages , and are among the oldest musical compositions still regularly sung for example , many of the carols written by alfred burt are sung regularly in both sacred and secular settings , and are among the better known modern christmas carols isaac watts , the '' father of english hymnody '' , composed '' joy to the world '' , which has become a popular christmas carol even though it is widely believed that watts did not write it to be sung only at christmas charles wesley wrote texts for at least three christmas carols , of which the best known was originally entitled '' hark ! how all the welkin rings '' , later edited to '' hark ! the herald angels sing '' the tradition of singing carols outside of church services early in the 19th century is best illustrated by thomas hardy 's novel '' under the greenwood tree '' ( 1872 ) most churches have special services at which carols are sung , generally combined with readings from scripture about the birth of christ ; this is often based on the famous festival of nine lessons and carols at king 's college , cambridge although this is sometimes taken as a reference to the three kings — biblical magi names — it may originally have represented the words christus mansionem benedicat ( christ bless this house ) in australia , south africa and new zealand , where it is the middle of summer at christmas , there is a tradition of carols by candlelight concerts held outdoors at night in cities and towns across the country , during the weeks leading up to christmas william garnet ( '' billy '' ) james ( 28 august 1892 – 10 march 1977 ) wrote music for christmas carol lyrics written by john wheeler ( both men worked for the australian broadcasting commission , or abc ) perhaps the best known traditional french carol , '' il est né , le divin enfant '' , comes from the region of provence roman mazurkiewicz , z dziejów polskiej kolędy there is a tradition of singing christmas carols until 2 february which is celebrated by western christians as the feast of the presentation of jesus at the temple although it is a christmas carol in wilhousky 's english lyrics , in original ukrainian lyrics it is a generous eve carol , , having nothing with christianity
