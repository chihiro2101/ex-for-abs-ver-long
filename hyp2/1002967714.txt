ibm 701 competed with remington rand 's univac 1103 in the scientific computation market , which had been developed for the nsa , so it was held secret until permission to market it was obtained in 1951 based on the trials , the two machines had comparable computational speed , with a slight advantage for ibm 's machine , but the univac was favored unanimously for its significantly faster input-output equipment palmer , ibm 's 360 and early 370 systems , mit press , 1991 , pp 23-34 at the lawrence livermore national laboratory , an ibm 701 meant that scientists could run nuclear explosives computations faster the first 701 was delivered to ibm 's world headquarters in new york in 1952 ibm paired with language scholars from georgetown university to develop a translation software for use on computers on january 7 , 1954 , the team developed an experimental software program that allowed the ibm 701 computer to translate from russian to english in 1954 , a group of scientists ran millions of simulated hands of blackjack on an ibm 701 looking to determine the best playing decision for every combination of cards the result of the study was the set of correct rules for hitting , standing , doubling or splitting in a blackjack game which are still the same today the ibm 701 can claim to be the first computer displaying the potential of artificial intelligence in arthur samuel 's checkers-playing program on february 24 , 1956 self-proclaimed checkers master robert nealey played the game on an ibm 7094 computer in 1962 and the computer won speedcode was the first high-level programming language created for an ibm computer the language was developed by john backus in 1953 for the ibm 701 to support computation with floating point the ibm 701 had only two programmer accessible registers : the accumulator was 38 bits long ( adding two overflow bits ) a notable first : the ibm 701 ( ibm archives ) oral history interview with gene amdahl charles babbage institute , university of minnesota , minneapolis amdahl discusses his role in the design of several computers for ibm including the ibm 701 , the ibm 704 and the stretch
