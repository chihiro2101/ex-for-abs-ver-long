the history of group dynamics ( or group processes ) has a consistent , underlying premise : 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts ' a social group is an entity that has qualities which can not be understood just by studying the individuals that make up the group ( the proposition remains questionable , since modern biologists and game theorists do look to explain the 'structural laws of the whole ' in terms of 'the way the elements fit together ' on the sociological side , émile durkheim ( 1858–1917 ) , who was influenced by wundt , also recognized collective phenomena , such as public knowledge in 1945 , he established the group dynamics research center at the massachusetts institute of technology , the first institute devoted explicitly to the study of group dynamics as humans social environments became more complex , they acquired adaptations by way of group dynamics that enhance survival examples include mechanisms for dealing with status , reciprocity , identifying cheaters , ostracism , altruism , group decision , leadership , and intergroup relations also , a combination of evolution and game theory has been used to explain the development and maintenance of cooperative behavior between individuals in a group gustave le bon was a french social psychologist whose seminal study , the crowd : a study of the popular mind ( 1896 ) led to the development of group psychology in group psychology and the analysis of the ego , ( 1922 ) , sigmund freud based his preliminary description of group psychology on le bon 's work , but went on to develop his own , original theory , related to what he had begun to elaborate in totem and taboo moreno was a psychiatrist , dramatist , philosopher and theoretician who coined the term '' group psychotherapy '' in the early 1930s and was highly influential at the time he coined the term group dynamics to describe the way groups and individuals act and react to changing circumstances schutz referred to these group dynamics as '' the interpersonal underworld , '' group processes which are largely unseen and un-acknowledged , as opposed to '' content '' issues , which are nominally the agenda of group meetings palo alto , ca : science and behavior books he discovered several mass group processes which involved the group as a whole adopting an orientation which , in his opinion , interfered with the ability of a group to accomplish the work it was nominally engaged in yalom , the theory and practice of group psychotherapy , third edition , basic books ( 1985 ) , hardback , bion 's experiences are reported in his published books , especially experiences in groups the tavistock institute has further developed and applied the theory and practices developed by bion bruce tuckman ( 1965 ) proposed the four-stage model called tuckman 's stages for a group this model refers to the overall pattern of the group , but of course individuals within a group work in different ways ( 1987 ) the different drum : community-making and peace.p examples of common barriers are : expectations and preconceptions ; prejudices ; ideology , counterproductive norms , theology and solutions ; the need to heal , convert , fix or solve and the need to control richard hackman developed a synthetic , research-based model for designing and managing work groups these include : being a real team : which results from having a shared task , clear boundaries which clarify who is inside or outside of the group , and stability in group membership enabling structure : which results from having tasks which have variety , a group size that is not too large , talented group members who have at least moderate social skill , and strong norms that specify appropriate behaviour hackman emphasizes that many team leaders are overbearing and undermine group effectiveness examples of groups include religious , political , military , and environmental groups , sports teams , work groups , and therapy groups in many fields of research , there is an interest in understanding how group dynamics influence individual behaviour , attitudes , and opinions residents ( ‘ americans ’ ) as a group , but could also define a more specific set of u.s notably , on this very broad level , the study of group dynamics is similar to the study of culture through interaction , individuals begin to develop group norms , roles , and attitudes which define the group , and are internalized to influence behaviour yet , these groups still express high levels of interdependence and coordinate knowledge , resources , and tasks groups can offer some advantages to its members that would not be possible if an individual decided to remain alone , including gaining social support in the forms of emotional support , instrumental support , and informational support the minimax principle is a part of social exchange theory that states that people will join and remain in a group that can provide them with the maximum amount of valuable rewards while at the same time , ensuring the minimum amount of costs to themselves however , this does not necessarily mean that a person will join a group simply because the reward/cost ratio seems attractive comparison level only predicts how satisfied a new member will be with the social relationships within the group to determine whether people will actually join or leave a group , the value of other , alternative groups needs to be taken into account thiabaut and kelley stated that the '' comparison level for alternatives can be defined informally as the lowest level of outcomes a member will accept in the light of available alternative opportunities ” joining and leaving groups is ultimately dependent on the comparison level for alternatives , whereas member satisfaction within a group depends on the comparison level if membership in the group is above the comparison level for alternatives but below the comparison level , membership will be not be satisfactory ; however , the individual will likely join the group since no other desirable options are available when group membership is below the comparison level for alternatives but above the comparison level , membership is satisfying but an individual will be unlikely to join if group membership is below both the comparison and alternative comparison levels , membership will be dissatisfying and the individual will be less likely to join the group groups can vary drastically from one another for example , three best friends who interact every day as well as a collection of people watching a movie in a theater both constitute a group therefore , it seems that individuals intuitively define aggregations of individuals in this way primary groups are characterized by relatively small , long-lasting groups of individuals who share personally meaningful relationships individuals that are a part of primary groups consider the group to be an important part of their lives individuals can be born into a primary group ; however , primary groups can also form when individuals interact for extended periods of time in meaningful ways a social group is characterized by a formally organized group of individuals who are not as emotionally involved with each other as those in a primary group these groups tend to be larger , with shorter memberships compared to primary groups further , social groups do not have as stable memberships , since members are able to leave their social group and join new groups the goals of social groups are often task-oriented as opposed to relationship-oriented if individuals believe that a group is high in entitativity , then they are likely to believe that the group has unchanging characteristics that are essential to the group , known as essentialism one 's personal identity is defined by more idiosyncratic , individual qualities and attributes in contrast , one 's social identity is defined by his or her group membership , and the general characteristics ( or prototypes ) that define the group and differentiate it from others instead , we make evaluations that are self-enhancing , emphasizing the positive qualities of our own group ( see ingroup bias ) in this way , these comparisons give us a distinct and valued social identity that benefits our self-esteem our social identity and group membership also satisfies a need to belong group cohesion , as a scientifically studied property of groups , is commonly associated with kurt lewin and his student , leon festinger while many norms are widespread throughout society , groups may develop their own norms that members must learn when they join the group saying thank you after someone does a favour for you ) proscriptive norms : actions that group members should not do ; prohibitive ( e.g on simple tasks , where the individual is not challenged by the task , the interference effect is negligible and performance , therefore , is facilitated according to social identity theory , intergroup conflict starts with a process of comparison between individuals in one group ( the ingroup ) to those of another group ( the outgroup ) in some cases , even without the four optimal conditions outlined by allport , prejudice between groups can be reduced
