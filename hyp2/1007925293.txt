one of the symptoms of conduct disorder is a lower level of fear if the caregiver is able to provide therapeutic intervention teaching children at risk better empathy skills , the child will have a lower incident level of conduct disorder conduct disorder can present with limited prosocial emotions , lack of remorse or guilt , lack of empathy , lack of concern for performance , and shallow or deficient affect often bullies , threatens , or intimidates others often initiates physical fights has used a weapon that can cause serious physical harm to others ( e.g , a bat , brick , broken bottle , knife , gun ) has been physically cruel to people has been physically cruel to animals has stolen while confronting a victim ( e.g this course is often linked to a more persistent life course and more pervasive behaviors specifically , children in this group have greater levels of adhd symptoms , neuropsychological deficits , more academic problems , increased family dysfunction and higher likelihood of aggression and violence there is debate among professionals regarding the validity and appropriateness of diagnosing young children with conduct disorder the characteristics of the diagnosis are commonly seen in young children who are referred to mental health professionals a premature diagnosis made in young children , and thus labeling and stigmatizing an individual , may be inappropriate it is also argued that some children may not in fact have conduct disorder , but are engaging in developmentally appropriate disruptive behavior the second developmental course is known as the '' adolescent-onset type '' and occurs when conduct disorder symptoms are present after the age of 10 years individuals with adolescent-onset conduct disorder exhibit less impairment than those with the childhood-onset type and are not characterized by similar psychopathology in addition to these two courses that are recognized by the dsm-iv-tr , there appears to be a relationship among oppositional defiant disorder , conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder moreover , both disorders share relevant risk factors and disruptive behaviors , suggesting that oppositional defiant disorder is a developmental precursor and milder variant of conduct disorder in fact , only about 25 % of children with oppositional defiant disorder will receive a later diagnosis of conduct disorder correspondingly , there is an established link between conduct disorder and the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder as an adult these developmental trajectories suggest the existence of antisocial pathways in certain individuals , which have important implications for both research and treatment specifically , risk factors associated with conduct disorder and the effects of conduct disorder symptomatology on a child 's psychosocial context have been linked to overlap with other psychological disorders in this way , there seems to be reciprocal effects of comorbidity with certain disorders , leading to increased overall risk for these youth adhd is the condition most commonly associated with conduct disorders , with approximately 25-30 % of boys and 50-55 % of girls with conduct disorder having a comorbid adhd diagnosis while it is unlikely that adhd alone is a risk factor for developing conduct disorder , children who exhibit hyperactivity and impulsivity along with aggression is associated with the early onset of conduct problems however , substance use disorders themselves can directly or indirectly cause conduct disorder like traits in about half of adolescents who have a substance use disorder as mentioned above , it seems that there is a transactional relationship between substance use and conduct problems , such that aggressive behaviors increase substance use , which leads to increased aggressive behavior these factors may also vary based on the age of onset , with different variables related to early ( e.g however , a correlation between a particular risk factor and a later developmental outcome ( such as conduct disorder ) can not be taken as definitive evidence for a causal link executive function difficulties may manifest in terms of one 's ability to shift between tasks , plan as well as organize , and also inhibit a prepotent response these reductions are associated with the inability to regulate mood and impulsive behaviors , weakened signals of anxiety and fear , and decreased self-esteem in addition , youth with conduct disorder also exhibit polymorphism in the monoamine oxidase a gene , low resting heart rates , and increased testosterone therefore , it is important to exclude a substance-induced cause and instead address the substance use disorder prior to making a psychiatric diagnosis of conduct disorder the most effective treatment for an individual with conduct disorder is one that seeks to integrate individual , school , and family settings the majority of research on conduct disorder suggests that there are a significantly greater number of males than females with the diagnosis , with some reports demonstrating a threefold to fourfold difference in prevalence
