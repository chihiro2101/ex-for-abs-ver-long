joachim du bellay was born at the castle of la turmelière , not far from liré , near angers , being the son of jean du bellay , lord of gonnor , first cousin of the cardinal jean du bellay and of guillaume du bellay both his parents died while he was still a child , and he was left to the guardianship of his elder brother , rené du bellay , who neglected his education , leaving him to run wild at la turmelière when he was twenty-three , however , he received permission to study law at the university of poitiers , no doubt with a view to his obtaining preferment through his kinsman the cardinal jean du bellay there too he probably met jacques peletier du mans , who had published a translation of the ars poetica of horace , with a preface in which much of the program advocated later by la pléiade is to be found in outline it was probably in 1547 that du bellay met ronsard in an inn on the way to poitiers , an event which may justly be regarded as the starting-point of the french school of renaissance poetry du bellay returned with ronsard to paris to join the circle of students of the humanities attached to jean dorat at the collège de coqueret while ronsard and jean-antoine de baïf were most influenced by greek models , du bellay was more especially a latinist , and perhaps his preference for a language so nearly connected with his own had some part in determining the more national and familiar note of his poetry the famous manifesto of the pléiade , the défense et illustration de la langue française ( defense and illustration of the french language , 1549 ) , was at once a complement and a refutation of sébillet 's treatise this book ( inspired in part by sperone speroni 's dialogo delle lingue , 1542 ) was the expression of the literary principles of the pléiade as a whole , but although ronsard was the chosen leader , its redaction was entrusted to du bellay du bellay maintained that the french language as it was then constituted was too poor to serve as a medium for the higher forms of poetry , but he contended that by proper cultivation it might be brought on a level with the classical tongues not only were the forms of classical poetry to be imitated , but a separate poetic language and style , distinct from those employed in prose , were to be used both du bellay and ronsard laid stress on the necessity of prudence in these borrowings , and both repudiated the charge of wishing to latinize their mother tongue du bellay did not actually introduce the sonnet into french poetry , but he acclimatized it ; and when the fashion of sonneteering became a mania he was one of the first to ridicule its excesses about this time du bellay had a serious illness of two years ' duration , from which dates the beginning of his deafness faustine was guarded by an old and jealous husband , and du bellay 's eventual conquest may have had something to do with his departure for paris at the end of august 1557 both works were published under the pseudonym of j quintil du troussay , and the courtier-poet was generally supposed to be mellin de saint-gelais , with whom du bellay had always , however , been on friendly terms
