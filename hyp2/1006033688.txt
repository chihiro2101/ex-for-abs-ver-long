the township was established at the base of the former roman fortress of levefanum in the 7th century the frankish carolingian empire and the frisians fought for control of the territory , until the franks gained control of the frisian coast in 719 dorestad flourished between the 7th century and the mid-9th century the settlement was well known for minting coins under the control of several frankish rulers in the 7th century , it was clear that dorestad had the potential to become a major port over time , many coins have been discovered in the dorestad area , supporting the idea of rapid growth and control of the harbour as well as the presence of a mint many of the coins that have been discovered bear resemblance to other frankish coins of the period the shift in the character of trade occurred as more and more trading towns popped up in the region as the trade increased across the board , the franks required more trading settlements to support the economy by the 830s , under the control of louis the pious , the expansion of the harbour had halted altogether , but coins continued to be minted for some time a division occurred in the frankish empire , and louis the pious was removed from the throne by his son as a result , louis the pious quickly took back dorestad and exiled his son to italy at this time , two things occurred in dorestad that led to its eventual downfall the first was that the franks lost even more interest in dorestad and as a result , even more control was transferred to the church although dorestad was raided only once , in 834 , it seems that the town never fully recovered afterwards the coast was battered by viking attacks , but it seems that dorestad was left relatively unscathed the mint was shut down when hroerekr took control of the lands while frankish defence was organized , that did not stop the danes from capturing dorestad and a large portion of the frisian coast in 850 the main reason that dorestad grew to be a lively trade city ( emporium ) was because of its location because of its wealth and success as a trade centre , dorestad got the attention of vikings in the 9th century only the '' lower town '' was excavated by archaeologists as much of dorestad was eroded away by the river bend the existence of these imports allowed dorestad 's economy to grow substantially
