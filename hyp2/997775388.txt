most dynamic recompilers are used to convert machine code between architectures at runtime in other cases , a system may employ dynamic recompilation as part of an adaptive optimization strategy to execute a portable program representation such as java or full-speed debuggers also utilize dynamic recompilation to reduce the space overhead incurred in most deoptimization techniques , and other features such as dynamic thread migration this processor can only copy a byte at a time , and must do so by first reading it from the source string into a register , then writing it from that register into the destination string the emulator might be running on a processor which is similar , but extremely good at copying strings , and the emulator knows it can take advantage of this for example , it may make better use of parallel computing in the processor to increment a and b while it is still copying bytes many java virtual machine feature dynamic recompilation the vx32 employs dynamic recompilation to create os-independent x86 architecture sandboxes for safe application plugins virtualbox uses dynamic recompilation valgrind , a programming tool for memory debugging , memory leak detection , and profiling , uses dynamic recompilation mame uses dynamic recompilation in its cpu emulators for mips , superh , powerpc and even the voodoo graphics processing units
