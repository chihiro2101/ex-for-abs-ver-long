q-switching is achieved by putting some type of variable attenuator inside the laser 's optical resonator a high q factor corresponds to low resonator losses per roundtrip , and vice versa initially the laser medium is pumped while the q-switch is set to prevent feedback of light into the gain medium ( producing an optical resonator with low q ) due to losses from spontaneous emission and other processes , after a certain time the stored energy will reach some maximum level ; the medium is said to be gain saturated at this point , the q-switch device is quickly changed from low to high q , allowing feedback and the process of optical amplifier by stimulated emission to begin because of the large amount of energy already stored in the gain medium , the intensity of light in the laser resonator builds up very quickly ; this also causes the energy stored in the medium to be depleted almost as quickly the net result is a short pulse of light output from the laser , known as a giant pulse , which may have a very high peak intensity an additional advantage of modulators is that the rejected light may be coupled out of the cavity and can be used for something else the material may be an ion-doped crystal like cr-yag , which is used for q-switching of nd-yag laser , a bleachable dye , or a passive semiconductor device ideally , this brings the absorber into a state with low losses to allow efficient extraction of the stored energy by the laser pulse this produces a shorter output pulse than regular q-switching a dumped cavity is more complicated to align than simple q-switching , and may need a control loop to choose the best time at which to dump the beam from the cavity nd : yag lasers are currently the most favoured lasers due to their high peak powers , high repetition rates and relatively low costs
