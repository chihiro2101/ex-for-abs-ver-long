adam smith , in his seminal work the wealth of nations , described wealth as '' the annual produce of the land and labour of the society '' in popular usage , wealth can be described as an abundance of items of economic value , or the state of controlling or possessing such items , usually in the form of money , real estate and personal property an individual who is considered wealthy , affluent , or rich is someone who has accumulated substantial wealth relative to others in their society or reference group in economics , net worth refers to the value of assets owned minus the value of liabilities owed at a point in time all these delineations make wealth an especially important part of social stratification wealth has been defined as a collection of things limited in supply , transferable , and useful in satisfying human desires when a desirable or valuable commodity ( transferable good or skill ) is abundantly available to everyone , the owner of the commodity will possess no potential for wealth the term implies a social contract on establishing and maintaining ownership in relation to such items which can be invoked with little or no effort and expense on the part of the owner the concept of wealth is relative and not only varies between societies , but varies between different sections or regions in the same society a personal net worth of us 10,000 in most parts of the united states would certainly not place a person among the wealthiest citizens of that locale however , such an amount would constitute an extraordinary amount of wealth in impoverished developing country modern labor-saving inventions and the development of the sciences have vastly improved the standard of living in modern societies for even the poorest of people adam smith saw wealth creation as the combination of materials , labour , land , and technology in such a way as to capture a profit ( excess above the cost of production ) in western civilization , wealth is connected with a quantitative type of thought , invented in the ancient greek '' revolution of rationality '' , involving for instance the quantitative analysis of nature , the rationalization of warfare , and measurement in economics the invention of coined money and banking was particularly important the term may also be used more broadly as referring to the productive capacity of a society or as a contrast to poverty for a given amount of wealth , say at the beginning of the year , income from that wealth , as measurable over say a year is a flow variable what marks the income as a flow is its measurement per unit of time , such as the value of apples yielded from the orchard per year one feature of its effect on economic behavior is the wealth elasticity of demand , which is the percentage change in the amount of consumption goods demanded for each one-percent change in wealth wealth may be measured in nominal or real values â€“ that is , in money value as of a given date or adjusted to net out price changes accounting measures net worth in terms of the historical cost of assets while economics measures wealth in terms of current values macroeconomic questions include whether the issuance of government bonds affects investment and consumption through the wealth effect environmental assets are not usually counted in measuring wealth , in part due to the difficulty of valuation for a non-market good environmental or green accounting is a method of national accounts for formulating and deriving such measures on the argument that an educated valuation is superior to a value of zero ( as the implied valuation of environmental assets ) assigning economic value to natural resources , national academy press social class is not identical to wealth , but the two concepts are related ( particularly in marxist theory ) , leading to the combined concept of socioeconomic status this includes tangible items such as jewelry , housing , cars , and other personal property the way the various social classes in society view wealth vary and these diverse characteristics are a fundamental dividing line among the classes upper class encompasses the top end of the income spectrum relative members of society as a whole it is in large part by accessing various edifices of information , associates , procedures and auspices that the upper class are able to maintain their wealth and pass it to future generations many older ideas have resurfaced in the modern notions of ecological stewardship , bioregionalism , natural capital , and ecological economics the high artisan skill also suggest the capacity to direct specialized labor to tasks that are not of any obvious utility to the group 's survival the rise of irrigation and urbanization , especially in ancient sumer and later egypt , unified the ideas of wealth and control of land and agriculture however , physical capital , as it came to be known , consisting of both the natural capital ( raw materials from nature ) and the infrastructural capital ( facilitating technology ) , became the focus of the analysis of wealth
