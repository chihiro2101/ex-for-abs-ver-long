every color-managed device requires a personalized table , or '' color profile , '' which characterizes the color response of that particular device each color profile describes these colors relative to a standardized set of reference colors ( the '' profile connection space '' ) color-managed software then uses these standardized profiles to translate color from one device to another to describe the behavior of various output devices , they must be compared ( measured ) in relation to a standard color space the icc standard permits the exchange of output device characteristics and color spaces in the form of metadata using a large ( gamut ) working space will lead to posterization , while using a small working space will lead to clipping color transformation , or color space conversion , is the transformation of the representation of a color from one color space to another this calculation is required whenever data is exchanged inside a color-managed chain and carried out by a color matching module transforming profiled color information to different output devices is achieved by referencing the profile data into a standard color space it makes it easier to convert colors from one device to a selected standard color space and from that to the colors of another device by ensuring that the reference color space covers the many possible colors that humans can see , this concept allows one to exchange colors between many different color output devices color transformations can be represented by two profiles ( source profile and target profile ) or by a devicelink profile this so-called gamut mismatch occurs for example , when we translate from the rgb color space with a wider gamut into the cmyk color space with a narrower gamut range color matching module ( also -method or -system ) is a software algorithm that adjusts the numerical values that get sent to or received from different devices so that the perceived color they produce remains consistent since 1997 color management in windows is available through an icc color management system ( icm )
