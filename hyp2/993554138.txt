there are two dimensions in aiming a weapon : in the horizontal plane ( azimuth ) ; and in the vertical plane ( elevation ) , which is governed by the distance ( range ) to the target and the energy of the propelling charge , are indirect ) , and guns mounted in aircraft are examples of weapons primarily designed for direct fire nato defines indirect fire as '' fire delivered at a target which can not be seen by the aimer '' aap-6 nato glossary of terms and definitions the implication is that azimuth and/or elevation 'aiming ' is done using instrumental methods hence indirect fire means applying 'firing data ' to azimuth and elevation sights and laying these sights indirect fire can be used when the target is visible from the firing position longer range uses a higher trajectory , and in theory maximum range is achieved with an elevation angle of 45 degrees it is also used with naval guns against shore targets , sometimes with machine guns , and has been used with tank and anti-tank guns and by anti-aircraft guns against surface targets the concealment aspect remains important , but from world war i equally important was the capability to concentrate the fire of many artillery batteries at the same target or set of targets this became increasingly important as the range of artillery increased , allowing each battery to have an ever-greater area of influence , but required command and control arrangements to enable concentration of fire the physical laws of ballistics means that guns firing larger and heavier projectile can send them further than smaller-calibre guns firing lighter shells during world war i , covered positions moved further back and indirect fire evolved to allow any point within range to be attacked , firepower mobility , without moving the firers it is also reasonable conjecture that if these mortars were used from inside fortifications their targets may have been invisible to them and therefore met the definition of indirect fire the british used improvised gun arcs with howitzers ; the sighting arrangements used by the boers with their german and french guns is unclear indirect fire needs a command and control arrangement to allot guns to targets and direct their fire there are two approaches to the azimuth that orients the guns of a battery for indirect fire
