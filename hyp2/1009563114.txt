menarche is the culmination of a series of physiological and anatomic processes of puberty : attainment of a sufficient body mass ( typically 17 % body fat ) over an interval of about 2 to 3 years , estrogen stimulates growth of the uterus ( as well as height growth , breast growth , widening of the pelvis , and increased regional adipose tissue ) death of some of the endometrial tissue from these hormone or blood supply fluctuations leads to deciduation , a sloughing of part of the lining with some blood flow from the vagina the initial flow of menarche is usually brighter than mature menstrual flow '' like other menses , menarche may be accompanied by abdominal pain in postmenarchal girls , about 80 % of the cycles were anovulatory in the first year after menarche , 50 % in the third and 10 % in the sixth year on the other hand , not every girl follows the typical pattern , and some girls ovulate before the first menstruation although unlikely , it is possible for a girl who has engaged in sexual intercourse shortly before her menarche to conceive and become pregnant , which would delay her menarche until after the end of the pregnancy this goes against the widely held assumption that a woman can not become pregnant until after menarche a young age at menarche is not correlated with a young age at first sexual intercourse in very rare instances , menarche may occur at an unusually early age , preceding thelarche and other signs of puberty this is termed isolated premature menarche , but other causes of vaginal bleeding must be investigated and excluded isolated premature menarche is rarely the first manifestation of precocious puberty when menarche has failed to occur for more than three years after thelarche , or beyond 16 years of age , the delay is referred to as primary amenorrhea short stature , delayed growth in height and weight , and/or delayed menarche may be the only clinical manifestations of celiac disease , in absence of any other symptoms according to a review article , there may also be an association between early age at menarche and breast cancer risk studies have been conducted to observe the association of the timing of menarche with various conditions and diseases some studies have shown that there may be an association between early or late-age menarche and cardiovascular disease , although the mechanism of the association is not well understood a systematic review has concluded that early age at menarche is also a risk factor for the insulin resistance condition in comparison with the effects of genetics , nutrition , and general health , social influences are small , shifting timing by a few months rather than years despite the small magnitude of effect , interpretations of the data are politically controversial because of the ease with which this type of research can be used for political advocacy thumb there were few systematic studies of timing of menarche before the later half of the 20th century this party is similar to the quincea√±era in latin america , except that a specific age marks the transition rather than menarche historically menstruation has been a social taboo and girls were taught about menarche and menstruation by their mothers or a female role model the girls who experience menarche wear special clothes and style their hair like the navajo goddess '' changing woman ''
