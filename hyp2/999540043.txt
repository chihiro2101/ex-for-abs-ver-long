bohemond was the son of robert guiscard , count of apulia and calabria , and his first wife , alberada of buonalbergo he was baptised mark , possibly because he was born at his father 's castle at san marco argentano in calabria his parents were related within the degree of kinship that made their marriage invalid under canon law bohemond fought in his father 's army during the rebellion of jordan i of capua , geoffrey of conversano and other norman barons in 1079 after robert guiscard arrived in the latter half of may , they laid siege to durazzo ( present-day durrës ) the byzantine emperor alexios i komnenos came to the rescue of the town but , on 18 october , his army suffered a crushing defeat during his absence , most of the norman commanders deserted to the byzantines and a venetian fleet recaptured durazzo and corfu two months later , the assembly of the norman barons confirmed the succession , but bohemond regarded himself his father 's lawful heir under the terms of their agreement , bohemond received taranto , oria , otranto , brindisi and gallipoli , but acknowledged roger borsa 's succession bohemond captured bari in 1090 and before long , took control of most lands to the south of melfi lilie details that bohemond 's '' father 's second marriage deprived him of future prospects , '' in norman italy others like bohemond had experience fighting the byzantines and muslim groups in the east fifteen years prior with robert guiscard it 's not clear what exact negotiations bohemond and alexios made concerning bohemond governing part of the eastern byzantine empire alexios hoped the crusaders would reclaim bohemond 's best chance at gaining a favorable position was to be loyal to alexios , which he attempted to prove while the crusaders were camped around constantinople bohemond also attempted to prove his loyalty by convincing other crusade leaders to take the oath of homage to alexios from constantinople to antioch , bohemond was a stand out among the leaders of the first crusade bohemond 's reputation as an effective strategist and leader came from his fighting experience in the balkans when he took charge of his father 's army against emperor alexios ( 1082–1085 ) this man who was of such a size and such a character was inferior to the emperor alone in fortune and eloquence and in other gifts of nature bohemond saw the opportunity to use the crusade for his own ends at the siege of antioch bohemond was able to make a deal with firouz , one of the commanders of the city wall to end the siege of antioch he then proposed to the other crusade leaders that the leader to take antioch should be put in charge of the city as alexios ' representative tetigus had left in february 1098 firouz led bohemond 's force up the walls of antioch , allowing the norman troops to infiltrate and ultimately capture the city bohemond was credited as the general and creator of the battle plan used to defeat kerbogha by raymond of aguilers raymond claimed that bohemond and other leaders would be breaking their oath to alexios , which was to give any conquered lands to the byzantine empire bohemond argued that because alexios had failed to come to the crusader 's aid at antioch that the oath was no longer valid raymond of toulouse decided to give up antioch to bohemond in january 1099 , as the other crusaders moved south to the capture of jerusalem after the fall of jerusalem to the crusaders , bohemond went to jerusalem at christmas 1099 to fulfill his crusade vows while there he took part in the installation of dagobert of pisa as patriarch of jerusalem , perhaps in order to check the growth of godfrey and his knights of lorraine 's power in the city it is a matter of historical debate whether his '' crusade '' against the byzantine empire was to gain the backing and indulgences of pope paschal ii bohemond saw the root of his problems in alexios and constantinople when it came to preserving the principality of antioch bohemond was then resolved to use his newly recruited army of 34,000 men not to defend antioch against the greeks , but to attack alexios under the treaty of devol in 1108 , he became the vassal of alexios with the title of sebastos , consented to receive alexios ' pay , and promised to cede disputed territories and to admit a greek patriarch into antioch antioch was left in norman hands with bohemond 's nephew tancred
