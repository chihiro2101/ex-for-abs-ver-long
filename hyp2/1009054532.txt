there are several theories about how and when gender identity forms , and studying the subject is difficult because children 's lack of language requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence john money suggested children might have awareness of and attach some significance to gender as early as 18 months to 2 years ; lawrence kohlberg argued that gender identity does not form until age 3 it is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age 3 a few authorities say it forms between ages 3–4 rather than precisely at age 3 , e.g soraka , sociology : cultural diversity in a changing world ( ed after age three , core gender identity is extremely difficult to change , j coleman , developmental stages of the coming out process , in journal of homosexuality , 1982 : '' core gender and sex-role identities are well-formed by the age of 3 ( money & ehrhardt , 1972 ) barbara newmann breaks it down into four parts : ( 1 ) understanding the concept of gender , ( 2 ) learning gender role standards and stereotypes , ( 3 ) identifying with parents , and ( 4 ) forming gender preference according to un agencies , discussions relating to comprehensive sexuality education raise awareness of topics , such as gender and gender identity in particular , the extent to which it is determined by socialization ( environmental factors ) versus innate ( biological ) factors is an ongoing debate in psychology , known as '' nature versus nurture '' biological factors that influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels 44 : '' when assigned and raised as boys , these genetic girls adopt a male gender identity and role , showing that a y chromosome is not necessary for gender development to proceed in a male direction when children are raised by individuals who adhere to stringent gender roles , they are more likely to behave in the same way , matching their gender identity with the corresponding stereotypical gender patterns he argued that infants are born a blank slate and a parent could be able to decide their babies ’ gender a well-known example in the nature-versus-nurture debate is the case of david reimer , otherwise known as '' john/joan '' as a baby , reimer went through a faulty circumcision , losing his male genitalia psychologist john money convinced reimer 's parents to raise him as a girl after he tried to commit suicide at age 13 , he was told that he had been born with male genitalia , which he underwent surgery to reconstruct this response went against money 's hypothesis that biology had nothing to do with gender identity or human sexual orientation diamond had contributed to research involving pregnant rats that showed hormones played a major role in the behavior of different sexes the researchers in the lab would inject the pregnant rat with testosterone , which would then find its way to the baby 's bloodstream the females in the litter also behaved like male rats and would even try to mount other female rats , proving that biology played a major role in animal behavior one criticism of the reimer case is that reimer lost his penis at the age of eight months and underwent sex reassignment surgery at seventeen months , which possibly meant that reimer had already been influenced by his socialization as a boy however , vandermassen also argues that transgender people support the idea of gender identity as being biologically rooted , as they do not identify with their anatomical sex despite being raised and their behaviour reinforced according to their anatomical sex '' discordant sexual identity in some genetic males with cloacal exstrophy assigned to female sex at birth using data from a variety of cases from the 1970s to the early 2000s ( including reiner et al ) , looked at males raised as females due to a variety of developmental disorders ( penile agenesis , cloacal exstrophy or penile ablation ) those still living as females still showed marked masculinisation of gender role behaviour and those old enough to reported sexual attraction to women the study 's authors caution drawing any strong conclusions from it due to numerous methodological caveats which were a severe problem in studies of this nature '' gender assignment surgery on children with disorders of sex development : a case report and discussion from south africa found that a sample of androphilic trans women was shifted towards the female direction in brain responses different amounts of these male or female sex hormones within a person can result in behavior and external genitalia that do not match up with the norm of their sex assigned at birth , and in a person acting and looking like their identified gender social scientists tend to assume that gender identities arise from social factors in 1955 , john money proposed that gender identity was malleable and determined by whether a child was raised as male or female in early childhood direct effects of testosterone on the developing fetal brain are of major importance for the development of male gender identity and male heterosexual orientation solid evidence for the importance of postnatal social factors is lacking the child thus is born to a gender-specific name , games , and even ambitions however , middle-class '' professional '' couples typically negotiate the division of labor and hold an egalitarian ideology these different views on gender from a child 's parents can shape the child 's understanding of gender as well as the child 's development of gender no correlation was found between a father 's behavior and his children 's knowledge of stereotypes of their own gender some people who experience gender dysphoria seek such medical intervention to have their physiological sex match their gender identity ; others retain the genitalia they were born with ( see transsexual for some of the possible reasons ) but adopt a gender role that is consistent with their gender identity the terms gender identity and core gender identity were first used with their current meaning—one 's personal experience of one 's own gender boles , 2013 102 : '' gender identity was introduced into the professional lexicon by hooker and stoller almost simultaneously in the early 1960s ( see money , 1985 ) for example , stoller ( 1964 ) used the slightly different term core gender identity no objective measurement or imaging of the human body exists for gender identity , as gender identity is part of one 's subjective experience these have varying effect sizes among a number of specific sub-populations some people , and some societies , do not construct gender as a binary in which everyone is either a boy or a girl , or a man or a woman those who belong to the additional gender categories , beyond cisgender man and woman , are now often collectively termed '' two-spirit '' or '' two-spirited '' human sexuality spectrum identity ( social science ) queer studies queer theory
