in the 1954 parliamentary elections the syrian regional branch won 22 seats in parliament , becoming the second largest party in the country 90 percent of ba'ath party members who stood for elections were elected to parliament the failure of the traditional parties represented by the people 's party and the national party , strengthened the ba'ath party 's public credibility through this position , the party was able to get two of its members into the cabinet ; bitar was appointed minister of foreign affairs and khalil kallas became minister of economics its new , strengthened position , was used successfully to garner support for syria 's merger with gamal abdel nasser 's egypt , which led to the establishment of the united arab republic ( uar ) in 1958 on 24 june 1959 , fuad al-rikabi , the regional secretary of the iraqi regional branch , accused the national command of betraying arab nationalist principles by conspiring against the uar rimawi reacted to his expulsion by forming his own party , the arab socialist revolutionary ba'ath party , which established a rival national command to compete with the original the national command responded to the problems in iraq by appointing a temporary regional command on 2 february 1960 , which appointed talib el-shibib as regional secretary , and on 15 june 1961 the national command expelled rikabi from the party in iraq , the iraqi regional branch had supported abd al-karim qasim 's seizure of power and its ensuing abolishment of the iraqi monarchy qasim was overthrown in the ramadan revolution led by young ba'athist officer ahmed hassan al-bakr , and rumoured to be supported by the american central intelligence agency ( cia ) on a separate plan to instigate a military coup against qasim , and who later became the head of the cia 's operations in iraq and syria '' from late 1968 to june 1970 , '' has '' denied any involvement in the ba'ath party 's actions '' the iraqi regional branch , when it took power , was so riven by factionalism that its purported allies launched a counter-coup forcing them out of power in november 1963 the 4th national congress , held in august 1960 , criticized the leadership of aflaq and bitar , called for the reestablishment of the syrian regional branch and deemphasized the party 's commitment to arab nationalism while emphasizing more the socialist character of the party a year after , at the uar 's nadir in syria , the syrian general abd al-karim al-nahlawi launched a coup on 28 september 1961 , which led to the reestablishment of the syrian arab republic the challenges of building a ba'athist state led to considerable ideological discussion and internal struggle within the party the iraqi regional branch was increasingly dominated by ali salih al-sadi , a self-described marxism he was supported in his ideological reorientation by hammud al-shufi , the regional secretary of the syrian regional branch , yasin al-hafiz , one of the party ’ s few ideological theorists , and by certain members of the secret military committee in 1963 the ba'ath party seized power , from then on the ba'ath functioned as the only officially recognized syrian political party , but factionalism and splintering within the party led to a succession of governments and new constitutions on 23 february 1966 , a coup d'état led by salah jadid , the informal head of the military committee , overthrew aflaq and the bitar 's cabinet the coup sprung out of factional rivalry between jadid 's '' regionalist '' ( qutri ) camp , which promoted ambitions for a greater syria and the more traditionally pan-arab , in power faction , called the '' nationalist '' ( qawmi ) faction several of jadid 's opponents managed to make their escape and fled to beirut , lebanon although he and his supporters had not been supporters of the victorious far-left line at the 6th party congress , they had now moved to adopt its positions however , both in iraq and syria , the regional command became the real centre of party power , and the membership of the national command became a largely honorary position , often the destination of figures being eased out of the leadership the organizational structure ran from top to bottom , and members were forbidden to initiate contacts between groups on the same level of the organisation—all contacts had to pass through a higher command level between national congresses , the national command was held accountable by the national consultative council ( arabic : al-majlis al-istishari al-quami ) the national consultative council was a forum made up of representatives from the party 's regional branches the national congress elected the national command , national tribunal , the party 's discipline body , and the secretary-general , the party leader in ba'athist jargon '' nation '' means the arab nation , because of that , the national command formed the highest policy-making and coordinating council for the ba'ath movement throughout the arab world the regional congress is made of delegates from the provincial branches ; other members attended , but as observers the regional congress was responsible for evaluating the party 's performance since the last regional congress , while at the same time formulating new policies for the next period , which lasts until the next regional congress is held the branch came above the subbranch ; it comprised at least two to five subbranches , and operated at the provincial level underneath the branch was the subbranch , which was made up of three to five sections , '' and was the lowest level of the party to hold a periodical congress '' some subbranches were independent of central authority , and elected their own command and secretaries , while other subbranches were incorporated into the branches it elected its own command , composed of five members , but the subbranch appointed the command 's secretary they functioned as the party ’ s watchdog and were an effective form of covert surveillance within a public administration the pan-arab tendencies of the party 's predecessor , the arab ba'ath movement , was strengthened 1945–1947 by recruiting members from the zaki al-arsuzi 's arab ba'ath the first article of the party 's constitution stated '' the arabs form one nation this conception of the arab nation implicitly advantages the arab contribution to history on the other hand , arab decadence can be overcome through a purifying and spiritual action , not religious but moral '' secondly , aflaq never had any official enmity towards the traditional landlords issues such as these would only gain prominence when akram al-hawrani became a leading party figure , and when the '' transitional ba'athists '' took power the early party organization never cultivated a deep following in rural areas the last tenet , 'socialism ' , did not mean socialism as it is defined in the west , but rather a unique form of arab socialism the original interpretation of arab socialism did not answer questions such as : how much state control was necessary , or economic equality ; but instead focused on freeing the arab nation and its people from colonization and oppression in general after the failure of the united arab republic ( uar ) , a union of egypt and syria , the ba'ath party was divided into two main factions , the regionalists and the nationalists ( pan-arab ) the end result was that the pro-arab nationalists within the ba'ath party became committed nasserists , while the more moderate arab nationalists founded the pro-nasserite socialist unionists party the third group , led by people disenchanted with both nasser and the union period , remained in the ba'ath party , stopped believing in the feasibility of pan-arabism many rank-and-file members opposed this change in policy , with many members being both disenchanted with pan-arabism and aflaq 's continued party rule the provincial party members had not been told of the syrian regional branch 's dissolution , which in fact broke the communication line with provincial branches and the national command after taking power , the regional branch through its militia , the national guard , initiated what iraqi expert con coughlin referred to as an '' orgy of violence '' against communism and left-wing elements the lebanese regional branch managed to elect three members to the national command at the 7th national congress ;
