image : chicxulub-anomaly.jpg thumb gravity anomaly map of the chicxulub impact area a series of concentric features reveals the location of the crater a ring of cenotes is associated with the largest semicircular feature , although its exact origin remains unclear penfield 's job was to use geophysical data to scout possible locations for oil drilling in the offshore magnetic data , penfield noted anomalies whose depth he estimated , and mapped according to penfield , '' the old data showed a large concentric set of onshore gravity anomalies '' a decade earlier , the same map suggested an impact feature to contractor robert baltosser , but he was forbidden to publicize his conclusion by pemex corporate policy of the time although penfield had plenty of geophysical data sets , he had no rock cores or other physical evidence of an impact this layer could have resulted from the intense heat and pressure of an earth impact , but at the time of the borings it was dismissed as a lava dome—a feature uncharacteristic of the region 's geology in 1981 , unaware of penfield 's discovery , university of arizona graduate student alan r such deposits occur in many locations but seem concentrated in the caribbean basin at the k–pg boundary ' so when haitian professor florentine morás discovered what he thought to be evidence of an ancient volcano on haiti , hildebrand suggested it could be a telltale feature of a nearby impact tests on samples retrieved from the k–pg boundary revealed more tektite glass , formed only in the heat of asteroid impacts and high-yield nuclear weapon in 1990 , houston chronicle reporter carlos byars told hildebrand of penfield 's earlier discovery of a possible impact crater more recent evidence suggests the crater is wide , and the 180 & nbsp ; km ring is an inner wall of it researchers at the university of glasgow dated tektite samples from the impact as 66,038,000 ± 11,000 & nbsp ; years old the chicxulub impactor had an estimated diameter of , and delivered an estimated energy of 21–921 & nbsp ; billion hiroshima a-bombs ( between 1.3×10 and 5.8×10 & nbsp ; joules , or 1.3–58 & nbsp ; yotta- ) in addition , the impact created winds in excess of 1000 kilometers per hour near the blast 's center the impact would have caused a megatsunami over tall that would have reached all the way to what are now texas and florida the height of the tsunami was limited by the relatively shallow sea in the area of the impact ; in deep ocean it would have been tall nonetheless , the most recent simulations show that waves may have been up to 1.5 kilometers ( ~1 & nbsp ; mi ) tall , able to reach the coastal lines all over the world a cloud of hot dust , ash and steam would have spread from the crater as the impactor burrowed underground in less than a second over a decade or longer , sunlight would have been blocked from reaching the surface of the earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere , cooling the surface dramatically a model of the event developed by lomax et al ( 2001 ) suggests that net primary productivity ( npp ) rates may have increased to higher than pre-impact levels over the long term because of the high carbon dioxide concentrations a long-term local effect of the impact was the creation of the yucatán sedimentary basin which '' ultimately produced favorable conditions for human settlement in a region where surface water is scarce the rocks above the impact feature are layers of marl and limestone reaching to a depth of almost the age of the rocks marked by the impact shows that this impact structure dates from roughly 66 million years ago , the end of the cretaceous period , and the start of the paleogene period the impact associated with the crater is thus implicated in the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event , including the worldwide extinction of non-avian dinosaurs iridium levels in this layer reached 6 parts per billion by weight or more compared with 0.4 for the earth 's crust as a whole ; web elements another possible crater thought to have been formed at the same time is the larger shiva crater , though the structure 's status as an impact crater is contested 364 obtained the first offshore core samples from the peak ring , surrounding the central zone of the crater the findings confirmed that the rock comprising the peak ring had originated deep in the earth , and was ejected to the surface the researchers stated that the impact generated an environmental calamity that extinguished life , but it also induced a vast subsurface hydrothermal system that became an oasis for the recovery of life
