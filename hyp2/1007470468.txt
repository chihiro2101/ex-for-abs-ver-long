design patterns gained popularity in computer science after the book design patterns was published in 1994 by the so-called '' gang of four '' ( gamma et al that same year , the first pattern languages of programming conference was held , and the following year the portland pattern repository was set up for documentation of design patterns notable books in the design pattern genre include : although design patterns have been applied practically for a long time , formalization of the concept of design patterns languished for several years effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation reusing design patterns helps to prevent such subtle issues , and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns design patterns provide general solutions , documented in a format that does not require specifics tied to a particular problem efforts have also been made to codify design patterns in particular domains , including use of existing design patterns as well as domain specific design patterns the documentation for a design pattern describes the context in which the pattern is used , the forces within the context that the pattern seeks to resolve , and the suggested solution one example of a commonly used documentation format is the one used by erich gamma , richard helm , ralph johnson , and john vlissides in their book design patterns related patterns : other patterns that have some relationship with the pattern ; discussion of the differences between the pattern and similar patterns peter norvig demonstrates that 16 out of the 23 patterns in the design patterns book ( which is primarily focused on c++ ) are simplified or eliminated ( via direct language support ) in lisp or dylan
