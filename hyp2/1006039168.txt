zirconium is one of the main components of zircon crystals , currently the oldest known minerals in the earth 's crust many later transition metals , such as rhodium , are very commonly used in jewelry due to the fact that they are incredibly shiny this period is known to have a large number of exceptions to the madelung rule rubidium is the first element placed in period 5 it is an alkali metal , the most reactive group in the periodic table , having properties and similarities with both other alkali metals and other period 5 elements for example , rubidium has 5 electron shells , a property found in all other period 5 elements , whereas its electron configuration 's ending is similar to all other alkali metals : s 1 rubidium also follows the trend of increasing reactivity as the atomic number increases in the alkali metals , for it is more reactive than potassium , but less so than caesium like rubidium , it has 5 electron shells or energy levels , and in accordance with the madelung rule it has two electrons in its 5s subshell in addition , strontium , like rubidium , redox in air and turns a yellow color it is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the lanthanides and it has often been classified as a '' rare earth element '' yttrium is almost always found combined with the lanthanides in rare earth minerals and is never found in nature as a free element in 1787 , carl axel arrhenius found a new mineral near ytterby in sweden and named it ytterbite , after the village johan gadolin discovered yttrium 's oxide in arrhenius ' sample in 1789 , yttrium krogt and anders gustaf ekeberg named the new oxide yttria the most important use of yttrium is in making phosphors , such as the red ones used in television set cathode ray tube ( crt ) displays and in leds zirconium is obtained mainly from the mineral zircon , which is the most important form of zirconium in use zirconium forms a variety of inorganic and organometallic compounds such as zirconium dioxide and zirconocene dichloride , respectively niobium , or columbium , is a chemical element with the symbol nb and atomic number 41 it is a soft , grey , ductile transition metal , which is often found in the pyrochlore mineral , the main commercial source for niobium , and columbite niobium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of the element tantalum , and the two are therefore difficult to distinguish the german chemist heinrich rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element , which he named niobium in 1864 and 1865 , a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element ( as distinguished from tantalum ) , and for a century both names were used interchangeably brazil is the leading producer of niobium and ferroniobium , an alloy of niobium and iron niobium is used mostly in alloys , the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines the temperature stability of niobium-containing superalloys is important for its use in jet and rocket engines in the last two applications , niobium 's low toxicity and ability to be colored by anodizing are particular advantages it readily forms hard , stable carbides , and for this reason it is often used in high-strength steel alloys industrially , molybdenum compounds are used in high-pressure and high-temperature applications , as pigments and catalysis it is the lowest atomic number element without any stable isotopes ; every form of it is radioactive naturally occurring technetium occurs as a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore or by neutron capture in molybdenum ores mendeleev noted a gap in his periodic table and gave the undiscovered element the provisional name ekamanganese ( em ) long-lived technetium isotopes produced commercially are by-products of fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods the russian scientist karl ernst claus discovered the element in 1844 and named it after ruthenia , the latin word for rus ' rhodium is a chemical element that is a rare , silvery-white , hard , and chemically inert transition metal and a member of the platinum group naturally occurring rhodium is found as the free metal , alloyed with similar metals , and never as a chemical compound it is one of the rarest precious metals and one of the most costly ( gold has since taken over the top spot of cost per ounce ) the element 's major use ( about 80 % of world rhodium production ) is as one of the catalysts in the catalytic converter three-way of automobiles he named it after the 2 pallas , which was itself named after the epithet of the greek goddess athena , acquired by her when she slew pallas it is also used for making particularly low melting point alloys , and is a component in some lead-free solders antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were used for cosmetics , metallic antimony was also known but mostly identified as lead in the universe and on earth , iodine 's high atomic number makes it a relatively rare element the radioisotope iodine-131 , which has a high fission product yield , concentrates in the thyroid , and is one of the most carcinogenic of nuclear fission products
