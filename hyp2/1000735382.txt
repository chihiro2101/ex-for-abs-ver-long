thomas wilson ( 1896 ) , suggested other etymologies , now considered untenable : '' in great britain the common name given to the swastika from anglo-saxon times was fylfot , said to have been derived from the anglo-saxon fower fot , meaning four-footed , or many-footed '' quoting from and '' the word fylfot is scandinavian and is compounded of old norse fiǫl- , equivalent to the anglo-saxon fela , german viel , '' many '' , and fótr , '' foot '' , the many-footed figure a fylfot is thus a '' poly-foot '' , to wit , a '' many-footed '' sigil the fylfot , together with its sister figure the gammadion , has been found in a great variety of contexts over the centuries thus we might usefully associate the gammadion more with byzantium , rome and graeco-roman culture on the one hand , and the fylfot more with celtic and anglo-saxon culture on the other they were certainly substantially in evidence during the romano-british period with widespread examples of the duplicated greek fret motif appearing on mosaics the fylfot was widely adopted in the early christian centuries as the parish guide rightly states , the fylfot or gammadion can be traced back to the roman catacombs where it appears in both christian and pagan contexts thumb in modern heraldry texts the fylfot is typically shown with truncated limbs , rather like a cross potent that 's had one arm of each t cut off from its use in heraldry—or from its use by antiquaries—fylfot has become an established word for this symbol , in at least british english odinic rite ( or ) , a germanic pagan organization , use both '' swastika '' and '' fylfot '' for what they claim as a '' holy symbol of odinism '' the or fylfot is depicted with curved outer limbs , more like a '' sunwheel swastika '' than a traditional ( square ) swastika or heraldic fylfot
