pietistic lutherans meet together in conventicles , '' apart from divine service in order to mutually encourage piety '' they believe '' that any true christian could point back in his or her life to an inner struggle with sin that culminated in a crisis and ultimately a decision to start a new , christ-centered life '' pietistic lutherans emphasize following '' biblical divine commands of believers to live a holy life and to strive for holy living , or sanctification '' in the 21st century pietism is still alive in groups inside the evangelical church in germany these groups are called landeskirchliche gemeinschaften and emerged in the second half of the 19th century in the so-called gemeinschaftsbewegung this movement focused on a reassertion of the identity of lutherans as a distinct group within the broader community of christians , with a renewed focus on the book of concord as a key source of lutheran doctrine scherer was professor of world mission and church history at the lutheran school of theology at chicago until his retirement heppe and ritschl – have included under it nearly all religious tendencies amongst protestants of the last three centuries in the direction of a more serious cultivation of personal piety than that prevalent in the various established churches some historians also speak of a later or modern pietism , characterizing thereby a party in the german church probably influenced by remains of spener 's pietism in westphalia , on the rhine , in württemberg , halle upon saale , and berlin the party , termed the repristination movement , was chiefly distinguished by its opposition to an independent scientific study of theology , its principal theological leader being hengstenberg and its chief literary organ , the evangelische kirchenzeitung pietism also had a strong influence on contemporary artistic culture in germany ; though unread today , the pietist johann georg hamann held a strong influence in his day pietistic lutheranism gained patronage under archbishop erik benzelius , who encouraged the pietistic lutheran practices laestadian lutheranism , a form of pietistic lutheranism , continues to flourish in scandinavia , where church of sweden priest lars levi laestadius spearheaded the revival in the 19th century as the forerunners of the pietists in the strict sense , certain voices had been heard bewailing the shortcomings of the church and advocating a revival of practical and devout christianity born at rappoltsweiler in alsace , now in france , on 13 january 1635 , trained by a devout godmother who used books of devotion like arndt 's true christianity , spener was convinced of the necessity of a moral and religious reformation within german lutheranism he studied theology at strasbourg , where the professors at the time ( and especially sebastian schmidt ) were more inclined to '' practical '' christianity than to theological disputation he afterwards spent a year in geneva , and was powerfully influenced by the strict moral life and rigid ecclesiastical discipline prevalent there , and also by the preaching and the piety of the waldensian professor antoine leger and the converted jesuit preacher jean de labadie during a stay in tübingen , spener read grossgebauer 's alarm cry , and in 1666 he entered upon his first pastoral charge at frankfurt with a profound opinion that the christian life within evangelical lutheranism was being sacrificed to zeal for rigid lutheran orthodoxy in 1675 , spener published his pia desideria or earnest desire for a reform of the true evangelical church , the title giving rise to the term '' pietists '' this was originally a pejorative term given to the adherents of the movement by its enemies as a form of ridicule , like that of '' methodists '' somewhat later in england in leipzig , a society of young theologians was formed under his influence for the learned study and devout application of the bible the lectures , however , aroused the ill-will of the other theologians and pastors of leipzig , and francke and his friends left the city , and with the aid of christian thomasius and spener founded the new university of halle spener died in 1705 , but the movement , guided by francke and fertilized from halle , spread through the whole of middle and north germany among its greatest achievements , apart from the philanthropic institutions founded at halle , were the revival of the moravian church in 1727 by count von zinzendorf , spener 's godson and a pupil in the halle school for young noblemen , and the establishment of protestant missions many pietists maintained that the new birth always had to be preceded by agonies of repentance , and that only a regenerated theologian could teach theology authorities within state-endorsed churches were suspicious of pietist doctrine which they often viewed as a social danger , as it '' seemed either to generate an excess of evangelical fervor and so disturb the public tranquility or to promote a mysticism so nebulous as to obscure the imperatives of morality as a distinct movement , pietism had its greatest strength by the middle of the 18th century ; its very individualism in fact helped to prepare the way for the enlightenment ( aufklärung ) , which took the church in an altogether different direction '' dietrich bonhoeffer of the german confessing church framed the same characterization in less positive terms when he called pietism the last attempt to save christianity as a religion : given that for him religion was a negative term , more or less an opposite to revelation , this constitutes a rather scathing judgment pietism is considered the major influence that led to the creation of the '' evangelical church of the union '' in prussia in 1817 ( many immigrants to america , who agreed with the union movement , formed german evangelical lutheran and reformed congregations , later combined into the evangelical synod of north america , which is now a part of the united church of christ as such , laestadius '' spend the rest of his life advancing his idea of lutheran pietism , focusing his energies on marginalized groups in the northernmost regions of the nordic countries '' laestadian lutherans gather in a central location for weeks at a time for summer services in which many young adults find their future spouses pietism had an influence on american religion , as many german immigrants settled in pennsylvania , new york , and other areas in zusammenarbeit mit gustav adolf benrath , eberhard busch , pavel filipi , arnd götzelmann , pentii laasonen , hartmut lehmann , mark a
