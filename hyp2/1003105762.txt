desmostylians were large , fully aquatic quadrupeds with massive limbs and short tails their dental and skeletal forms suggest that desmostylians were aquatic herbivores dependent on littoral habitats their legs seemed to be adapted for terrestrial locomotion , while a number of other parameters confirms their aquatic nature : fossils have been found in marine strata ) however , a more recent and detailed analysis of desmostylian bone structure has revealed them to be fully aquatic , like sirenians and cetaceans , with their limbs being incapable of supporting their own weight on land more recent studies vindicate this assessment , as desmostylians had a thoracic morphology more similar to sirenians and modern cetaceans than to that of semiaquatic mammals desmostylians , being fully marine herbivores , are thought to have been outcompeted ecologically by dugongid sirenians in particular , later species like neoparadoxia are more specialised than previous forms , suggesting increased divergence to compete with sirenians , and sirenian diversity appears to increase with desmostylian decline the type species desmostylus hesperus was originally classified from a few teeth and vertebrae as a sirenian by , but doubts arose a decade later when more complete fossils were discovered in japan merriam , who concluded on the basis of the molar structure and repeated occurrence in marine beds that the animals had been aquatic , and were probably sirenian douglas emlong 's 1971 discovery of the new genus behemotops from oregon showed that early desmostylians had more proboscidean-like teeth and jaws than later ones
