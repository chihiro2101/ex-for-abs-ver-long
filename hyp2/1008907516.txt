despite the increase in ivr technology during the 1970s , the technology was considered complex and expensive for automating tasks in call centers the first commercial application of ivr was an order entry inventory control system designed and developed by steven schmidt in 1973 early voice response systems were dsp technology based and limited to small vocabularies at that time , a system could store digitized speech on disk , play the appropriate spoken message , and process the human 's dtmf response as call centers began to migrate to multimedia in the late 1990s , companies started to invest in computer telephony integration ( cti ) with ivr systems with improvements in technology , systems could use speaker-independent voice recognition of a limited vocabulary instead of requiring the person to use dtmf signaling dtmf decoding and speech recognition are used to interpret the caller 's response to voice prompts other technologies include using text-to-speech ( tts ) to speak complex and dynamic information , such as e-mails , news reports or weather information this information can be used to profile the caller and route the call to an agent with a particular skill set ) interactive voice response can be used to front-end a call center operation by identifying the needs of the caller account numbers from the ivr are often compared to caller id data for security reasons and additional ivr responses are required if the caller id does not match the account record ivr speech recognition interactions ( call flows ) are designed using 3 approaches to prompt for and recognize user input : directed , open-ended , and mixed dialogue '' balance was wrong '' , '' wrong balance '' , '' balance is high '' , '' high balance '' ) despite the greater amount of data and processing required for open-ended prompts , they are more interactively efficient , as the prompts themselves are typically much shorter in addition , these tools normally provide extension mechanisms for software integration , such as an http interface to a website and a java interface for connecting to a database ivr systems are used to service high call volumes at lower cost the approach allows live agents to have more time to deal with complex interactions when an ivr system answers multiple phone numbers , the use of dnis ensures that the correct application and language is executed a single large ivr system can handle calls for thousands of applications , each with its own phone numbers and script in a system wherein individual customers may have a different status , the service will automatically prioritize the individual 's call and move customers to the front of a specific queue telephone banking allows customers to check balances and transaction histories as well as to make payments and transfers the introduction of session initiation protocol ( sip ) means that point-to-point communications are no longer restricted to voice calls but can now be extended to multimedia technologies such as video it is also possible to deploy two-prong ivr services where the initial ivr application is used to route the call to the appropriate contact center ivr has historically received criticism for its difficulty of use and a lack of appreciation of the caller 's needs as well as objections to providing a voice response to an automated system
