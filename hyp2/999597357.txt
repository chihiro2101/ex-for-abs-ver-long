bohm was born in wilkes-barre , pennsylvania , to a hungarian jewish immigrant father , samuel bohm , - by the numbers – david bohm and a lithuanian jewish mother he was raised mainly by his father , a furniture-store owner and assistant of the local rabbi despite being raised in a jewish family , he became an agnostic in his teenage years bohm attended pennsylvania state college ( now pennsylvania state university ) , graduating in 1939 , and then the california institute of technology , for one year he then transferred to the theoretical physics group directed by robert oppenheimer at the university of california , berkeley radiation laboratory , where he obtained his doctorate bohm lived in the same neighborhood as some of oppenheimer 's other graduate students ( giovanni rossi lomanitz , joseph weinberg , and max friedman ) and with them became increasingly involved in radical politics he was active in communist and communist-backed organizations , including the young communist league , the campus committee to fight conscription , and the american peace mobilization during world war ii , the manhattan project mobilized much of berkeley 's physics research in the effort to produce the first atomic bomb & nbsp ; 64 ) , '' the scattering calculations ( of collisions of protons and deuterons ) that he had completed proved useful to the manhattan project and were immediately classified bohm later performed theoretical calculations for the calutrons at the y-12 facility in oak ridge , tennessee , which was used for the isotope separation electromagnetic for the bomb dropped on hiroshima in 1945 in may 1949 , the house un-american activities committee called upon bohm to testify because of his previous ties to unionism and suspected communists after his acquittal , bohm 's colleagues sought to have him reinstated at princeton , but princeton president harold w dodds russell olwell : physics and politics in cold war america : the two exiles of david bohm , working paper number 20 his request to go to the university of manchester received einstein 's support but was unsuccessful albert einstein to patrick blackett , 17 april 1951 ( albert einstein archives ) bohm then left for brazil to assume a professorship of physics at the university of são paulo , at jayme tiomno 's invitation and on the recommendation of both einstein and oppenheimer as a postgraduate at berkeley , he developed a theory of plasmas , discovering the electron phenomenon now known as bohm diffusion hiley : zeno paradox for bohmian trajectories : the unfolding of the metatron , 3 january 2011 ( pdf & nbsp ; – retrieved 16 february 2012 ) bohm 's aim was not to set out a deterministic , mechanical viewpoint but to show that it was possible to attribute properties to an underlying reality , in contrast to the conventional approach hiley : some remarks on the evolution of bohm 's proposals for an alternative to quantum mechanics , 30 january 2010 he began to develop his own interpretation ( the de broglie–bohm theory , also called the pilot wave theory ) , the predictions of which agreed perfectly with the non-deterministic quantum theory : science and exile : david bohm , the cold war , and a new interpretation of quantum mechanics , hsps , vol & nbsp ; 1–34 , issn 0890-9997 , 2005 at the university of são paulo , bohm worked on the causal theory that became the subject of his publications in 1952 anderson , donald kerst , marcos moshinsky , alejandro medina , and the former assistant to heisenberg , guido beck , who encouraged him in his work and helped him to obtain funding his work with vigier was the beginning of a long-standing cooperation between the two and louis de broglie , in particular , on connections to the hydrodynamics model proposed by madelung from 1951 to 1953 , bohm and david pines published the articles in which they introduced the random phase approximation and proposed the plasmon in 1955 bohm relocated to israel , where he spent two years working at the technion , at haifa in 1957 , bohm and his student yakir aharonov published a new version of the epr paradox , reformulating the original argument in terms of spin & nbsp ; 1070–1076 ( abstract ) it was that form of the epr paradox that was discussed by john stewart bell in his famous paper of 1964 that showed for the first time that the magnetic vector potential , hitherto a mathematical convenience , could have real physical ( quantum ) effects in 1961 , bohm was made professor of theoretical physics at the university of london 's birkbeck college , becoming emeritus in 1987 & nbsp ; 171–183 , , abstract david bohm , f bohm 's prolonged involvement with the philosophy of krishnamurti was regarded somewhat skeptically by some of his scientific peers neural receptors throughout the body inform us directly of our physical position and movement , but there is no corresponding awareness of the activity of thought david peat , infinite potential : the life and times of david bohm , reading , massachusetts : addison wesley , 1997 , pp
