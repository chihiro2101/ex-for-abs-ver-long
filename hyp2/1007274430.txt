rather than face steady demise as the new form of transport developed , a number of the proprietors formed the manchester & lincoln union railway company in october 1845 the new scheme was in direct competition to the earlier one , but the two sets of proprietors met and agreed to amalgamate now arguing from a position of strength , the manchester & lincoln union rescinded their plans for most of their lines , and obtained an act of parliament on 7 august 1846 allowing them to construct a line from the midland railway at staveley to the canal at worksop the new company amalgamated with the chesterfield canal , to become the rather unwieldy manchester & lincoln union railway & chesterfield & gainsborough canal , with powers to further amalgamate with the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway the act of parliament stated that although the canal company was to be dissolved , the entire canal was to be retained , its water supplies maintained , and tolls were to be fixed at a just level the railway company started to operate as a carrier on the canal , and to maintain water levels , the reservoirs at chesterfield were enlarged in 1856 however , the owners considered options for converting the canal from kiverton park to chesterfield into a railway in 1872 , 1873 and 1884 , but on each occasion , the plans were shelved the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway was expanding , and an act of parliament was obtained in 1889 , which allowed them to divert parts of the canal to enable a new railway connecting chesterfield , staveley and beighton to be constructed the railway 's carrying business on this and other canals ceased shortly afterwards prior to construction of this section , the canal looped to the north around the iron works , passing through cinderhill lock before turning south-eastwards responsibility for the canal passed the london and north eastern railway ( lner ) in 1923 , who carried out regular maintenance , and repaired and enlarged the lock connecting west stockwith basin to the river trent between 1923 and 1925 by 1961 , the canal had been formally closed , all requests to use it for leisure purposes were refused , and there were proposals for official abandonment of its entire length the british transport commission agreed to keep the canal open for two more years in 1962 , although the lockgates from worksop to kiveton were removed , and the lock walls bulldozed , on the grounds of public safety clarke formed the retford and worksop ( chesterfield canal ) boat club soon afterwards , and it became a limited company in 1966 , to cope with the growing membership such activity became slightly more collaborative when the canal became the responsibility of the british waterways board the chesterfield canal trust was formed in september 1976 , determined to restore the canal beyond worksop , and in 1977 they organised a boat rally at worksop to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the canal , in conjunction with the worksop and retford boat club bassetlaw district council provided financial backing , and the event was held over four days , coinciding with the queen 's silver jubilee the duke of devonshire opened the festivities , and the chesterfield canal society was formally launched , with a view to attracting support from anyone interested in the canal , rather than just from boaters thumb restoration had focussed initially on the route east from norwood tunnel to worksop , which presented relatively few physical obstacles to being restored to navigation however , in practice progress had been slow , and attention turned to the section west of norwood tunnel , where much more damage had been done to the canal bed , with it being filled in and built over in many places the last few miles of the canal , from chesterfield to staveley , were in reasonable condition , although the towpath was overgrown and difficult to access , while much of the route was under threat from opencast coal mining and a planned bypass , which had first been proposed in 1927 regular workparties began the process of restoration in 1988 , organised by the chesterfield canal society , and supplemented by volunteers from the waterway recovery group periodically in a separate development , a private owner of a length of the canal near boiley farm , killamarsh , obtained a derelict land grant to enable him to restore around of the channel in 1992 although used as fishing ponds , the work resulted in a navigable profile being re-established , and a water supply was obtained from a small unnamed brook , which feeds into the southern end of the ponds a breach in the canal in march 2007 , caused by the collapse of a culvert carrying the tinkersick brook under the canal , forced temporary closure of all but the top pound above tapton lock for about six weeks although the track on the mineral line has been removed , its route may be reused to provide access to a maintenance depot , for the high speed 2 ( hs2 ) railway project the basin was completed and was opened in october 2009 , although it remains isolated from the river rother , to which it will be connected by a lock , while a back-pumping facility will supply it with water norwood tunnel was a , and , brick-lined canal tunnel on the line of the chesterfield canal with its western portal in norwood , derbyshire and its eastern portal in kiveton , south yorkshire the towpath of the canal has become a long-distance footpath and cycle route , stretching for from chesterfield to west stockwith , and is signposted as the '' cuckoo way '' after the name given to the boats which worked on the canal later that day , it was noticed that a whirlpool had formed and it became evident that the section of the canal between whitsunday pie lock and retford town lock was losing water
