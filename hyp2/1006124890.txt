usually , an enzyme molecule has only two active sites , and the active sites fit with one specific type of substrate an active site contains a binding site that binds the substrate and orients it for catalysis the orientation of the substrate and the close proximity between it and the active site is so important that in some cases the enzyme can still function properly even though all other parts are mutated and lose function there are four important types of interaction that hold the substrate in a defined orientation and form an enzyme-substrate complex ( es complex ) : hydrogen bonds , van der waals force , hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions the charge distribution on the substrate and active site must be complementary , which means all positive and negative charges must be cancelled out the active site usually contains non-polar amino acids , although sometimes polar amino acids may also occur if these interactions are interfered with , for example by extreme ph values , high temperature or high ion concentrations , this will cause the enzyme to denature and lose its catalytic activity a tighter fit between an active site and the substrate molecule is believed to increase the efficiency of a reaction if the tightness between the active site of dna polymerase and its substrate is increased , the fidelity , which means the correct rate of dna replication will also increase most enzymes have deeply buried active sites , which can be accessed by a substrate via access channels there are three proposed models of how enzymes fit their specific substrate : the lock and key model , the induced fit model , and the conformational selection model the latter two are not mutually exclusive : conformational selection can be followed by a change in the enzyme 's shape he proposed that the active site and substrate are two stable structures that fit perfectly without any further modification , just like a key fits into a lock for example , the competitive enzyme inhibitor methylglucoside can bind tightly to the active site of 4-alpha-glucanotransferase and perfectly fits into it the lock and key hypothesis can not explain this , as it would predict a high efficiency of methylglucoside glycosyl transfer due to its tight binding apart from competitive inhibition , this theory can not explain the mechanism of action of non-competitive inhibition either , as they do not bind to the active site but nevertheless influence catalytic activity daniel koshland 's theory of enzyme-substrate binding is that the active site and the binding portion of the substrate are not exactly complementary the induced fit model is a development of the lock-and-key model and assumes that an active site is flexible and changes shape until the substrate is completely bound after the reaction products will move away from the enzyme and the active site returns to its initial shape electrostatic interaction : in an aqueous environment , the oppositely charged groups in amino acid side chains within the active site and substrates attract each other , which is termed electrostatic interaction van der waals force : van der waals force is formed between oppositely charged groups due to transient uneven electron distribution in each group hydrophobic interaction : non-polar hydrophobic groups tend to aggregate together in the aqueous environment and try to leave from polar solvent these hydrophobic groups usually have long carbon chain and do not react with water molecules next , the active site is designed to reorient the substrate to reduce the activation energy for the reaction to occur in the end , the active site may manipulate the molecular orbital of the substrate into a suitable orientation to reduce activation energy a polarized negatively charged amino acid side chain will repel uncharged substrate the former one is mainly affected by the basicity ( the ability to donate electron pairs ) of the species while the later one is in regard to its pk a this reaction usually requires cofactors as the amino acid side chains are not strong enough in attracting electrons the formation of transition state within the solution requires a large amount of energy to relocate solvent molecules and the reaction is slowed so the active site can substitute solvent molecules and surround the substrates to minimize the counterproductive effect imposed by the solution the presence of charged groups with the active site will attract substrates and ensure electrostatic complementarity during this process , its thiol side chain is oxidised and two glutathione molecules are connected by a disulphide bond to form a dimer ( gssg ) in the active site , there are two cysteine residues besides the fad cofactor and are used to break the disulphide bond during the catalytic reaction larger ligands generally stay in the active site longer , as do those with more rotatable bonds ( although this may be a side effect of size ) they usually bind to a different site on the enzyme and alter the 3-dimensional structure of the active site to block substrates from entry or leaving the enzyme thumb an regulatory site is a site on an enzyme , unrelated to its active site , which can bind an effector molecule
