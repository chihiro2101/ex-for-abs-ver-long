inventory management involves a retailer seeking to acquire and maintain a proper merchandise assortment while ordering , shipping , handling , and related costs are kept in check it also involves systems and processes that identify inventory requirements , set targets , provide replenishment techniques , report actual and projected inventory status and handle all functions related to the tracking and management of material this would include the monitoring of material moved into and out of stockroom locations and the reconciling of the inventory balances management of the inventories , with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution system , functions to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock holding and handling costs there are five basic reasons for keeping an inventory time – the time lags present in the supply chain , from supplier to user at every stage , requires that you maintain certain amounts of inventory to use in this lead time however , in practice , inventory is to be maintained for consumption during 'variations in lead time ' this can lead to stock accumulation , consider for example how goods consumed only in holidays can lead to accumulation of large stocks on the anticipation of future consumption uncertainty – inventories are maintained as buffers to meet uncertainties in demand , supply and movements of goods economies of scale – ideal condition of '' one unit at a time at a place where a user needs it , when he needs it '' principle tends to incur lots of costs in terms of logistics so bulk buying , movement and storing brings in economies of scale , thus inventory appreciation in value – in some situations , some stock gains the required value when it is kept for some time to allow it reach the desired standard for consumption , or for production stock keeping unit ( sku ) skus are clear , internal identification numbers assigned to each of the products and their variants skus can be any combination of letters and numbers chosen , just as long as the system is consistent and used for all the products in the inventory an sku code may also be referred to as product code , barcode , part number or mpn ( manufacturer 's part number ) such merchandise may not be produced anymore , and the new old stock may represent the only market source of a particular item at the present time while accountants often discuss inventory in terms of goods for sale , organizations – manufacturers , service providers and not-for-profits – also have inventories ( fixtures , furniture , supplies , etc manufacturers ' , distributors ' , and wholesalers ' inventory tends to cluster in warehouses inventories not intended for sale to customers or to clients may be held in any premises an organization uses while the reasons for holding stock were covered earlier , most manufacturing organizations usually divide their '' goods for sale '' inventory into : raw materials – materials and components scheduled for use in making a product a canned food manufacturer 's materials inventory includes the ingredients to form the foods to be canned , empty cans and their lids ( or coils of steel or aluminum for constructing those components ) , labels , and anything else ( solder , glue , etc the firm 's work in process includes those materials from the time of release to the work floor until they become complete and ready for sale to wholesale or retail customers a '' virtual inventory '' ( also known as a '' bank inventory '' ) enables a group of users to share common parts , especially where their availability at short notice may be critical but they are unlikely to required by more than a few bank members at any one time holding excess inventory is sub-optimal because the money spent to obtain and the cost of holding it could have been utilized better elsewhere , i.e one early example of inventory proportionality used in a retail application in the united states was for motor fuel the motorists do not know whether they are buying gasoline off the top or bottom of the tank , nor need they care inventory proportionality is used to balance the inventories of the different grades of motor fuel , each stored in dedicated tanks , in proportion to the sales of each grade this application for motor fuel was first developed and implemented by petrolsoft corporation in 1990 for chevron products company those companies ( especially in metalworking ) attempted to achieve success through economies of scope - the gains of jointly producing two or more products in one facility a variety of attempts to achieve this were unsuccessful due to the huge overhead of the information processing of the time however , the burgeoning need for financial reporting after 1900 created unavoidable pressure for financial accounting of stock and the management need to cost manage products became overshadowed the dominance of financial reporting accounting over management accounting remains to this day with few exceptions , and the financial reporting definitions of 'cost ' have distorted effective management 'cost ' accounting since that time the second formula then creates the new start point for the next period and gives a figure to be subtracted from the sales price to determine some form of sales-margin figure manufacturing management is more interested in inventory turnover ratio or average days to sell inventory since it tells them something about relative inventory levels business models , including just in time ( jit ) inventory , vendor managed inventory ( vmi ) and customer managed inventory ( cmi ) , attempt to minimize on-hand inventory and increase inventory turns vmi and cmi have gained considerable attention due to the success of third-party vendors who offer added expertise and knowledge that organizations may not possess it is intentional that financial accounting uses standards that allow the public to compare firms ' performance , cost accounting functions internally to an organization and potentially with much greater flexibility standard cost accounting uses ratios called efficiencies that compare the labour and materials actually used to produce a good with those that the same goods would have required under '' standard '' conditions inventories also play an important role in national accounts and the analysis of the business cycle also known as distressed or expired stock , distressed inventory is inventory whose potential to be sold at a normal cost has passed or will soon pass a precondition for such credit is that banks must be confident that the stored product will be available if they need to call on the collateral ; this implies the existence of a reliable network of certified warehouses
