built-up areas extend a half kilometer beyond the city walls in all directions the stone perimeter wall has twelve gates , including seven major gates with vaulted entrances the wall is 9.1 & nbsp ; km ( about 5.65 miles ) long and is roughly ovate with a pointed northeast corner smith , an archeologist with the carnegie institute , estimated 10–12,000 people lived within the walled city gregory simons survey outside the city walls , there were numerous additional dwellings and he revised the total population estimate to between 15,000–17,000 people people living outside of the city wall engaged in agriculture , animal-raising , and specialized activities such as lime production russell also found a colonnaded hall outside the city wall , revealing much is still to be discovered regarding the complexity of this urban landscape the temple of kukulcan , a large pyramid also known as the castillo , is the main temple in mayapan it is located immediately to the east of the cenote ch'en mul , which has caves radiating from it the extensive residential zones of the site are composed of dwellings and ancillary domestic structures , with those around the ceremonial district larger and of higher quality and those toward the fringes being generally poorer the houses are often arranged in small patio groups surrounding small courtyards houses were built haphazardly without organized streets the residential areas of the site contain many cenotes , perhaps as many as 40 settlement was the most dense in the southwestern part of the city where cenotes are more numerous the lords divided the towns of yucatán among them , and chose the chief of the cocom family as their leader the ethnohistorical sources recount multiple different histories of the rise and fall of mayapan ( roys 1962 ) for example , some sources say that the maya revolted in 1221 against the maya-toltec lords of chichen itza after a short civil war , the lords of various powerful cities and families met to restore a central government to yucatán excavation has revealed burnt roof beams in several of the major buildings in the site center stephens was the first to document parts of the mayapan site with two important illustrations the first was of the q-152 round temple , and the second was of the pyramid of kukulkan he was the first in a long string of explorers who drew the ruins of mayapan the first large-scale archeological site surveys were not conducted until 1938 by r.t their work was published in a mimeographed series of current reports the current reports have recently been republished in their entirety by the university of colorado press ( john weeks 2009 ) pollock , ralph l robert smith published a two-volume monograph on the pottery of mayapan in 1971 ( papers of the peabody museum of archaeology and ethnology 66 , harvard university ) brown of tulane university carried out excavations in the residential zones of mayapan as part of his doctoral dissertation research 1200 and may have included types named mama red and navula unslipped , more commonly associated with southern lowland settlements researchers think that this sample represented old charcoal that predated the context in which it was found : a burial found on bedrock in the houselot soils of a post-classical solare dated between a.d the burial appeared to be a secondary interment , and could not be completely excavated because it intruded into a wall there was no pottery with the burial ; midden samples in this area suggest occupation prior to the construction of the post-classical houselots researchers think that this sample is not associated with the context in which it was found three separate samples form the frame for early mayapan occupation these dates are a.d however , two of these dates come from inexact sources one was burned copal found in an unknown structure ( apparently the label had eroded off of the structure ) ; the researchers inferred that it was q-95 the early date would suggest that this temple was built and in use in mayapan 's early history charcoal found in the early construction phase of the site 's main pyramid was dated a.d the fall of the city is tentatively dated around a.d 1461 , based on the lack of construction of altars and burial cists after this date diego de landa calderon , yucatán before and after the conquest , 1937 ( reprinted in 2008 ) see : abridged history of yucatan , pp yucatán before and after the conquest , by diego de landa 8 kukulcan 's realm : urban life at ancient mayapán , marilyn masson & carlos peraza lope , university press of colorado 2014 , chapter 8 : militarism , misery and collapse milpa , or mixed , fields may have been cultivated when mayapan was inhabited researchers have suggested that mayapan was an import/export center , and that they often traded luxury goods , such as cotton , salt , and honey , for products of obsidian and metal , which they would have forged also , citrus fruit such as oranges and limes are often grown within the domestic house groups of the local residents ( russell 2008:16 ) both turtle and rabbit remains were found in both sites , but they were consumed in small amounts ( less than 1.5 % ) while excavating , the researchers noted many fish skeletons , but few fish heads they concluded that the fish were being traded into mayapan , and not collected near the site within the ceremonial center , numerous deer heads and teeth were found among the remains mayapan was a major capital in the yucatán , and there is extensive evidence that it had far-reaching trade routes , as seen in architecture and artifacts of other settlements in the region zacpeten on lake salpeten & nbsp ; – incense burners found at this site are nearly identical to those found at mayapan topoxte in lake yaxha , peten also shares similarities of architecture and artifacts of effigy censers the two sites appear to have been abandoned around the same time ; which may suggest a connection between their governments the east coast sites exported products such as cotton , salt , and honey from the yucatán ( 2009 ) '' appendix : inventory and lot descriptions '' carnegie institution current reports on mayapan tatiana proskouriakoff ( 1962 ) civic and religious structures at mayapán , in “ introduction , ” in mayapán , yucatan , mexico , by harry e restall , matthew 2001 the people of the patio : ethnohistoric evidence of yucatec maya royal courts '' traditional burnt-lime production at mayapán , mexico '' , journal of field archaeology 32:407-423 ledyard smith ( 1962 ) '' residential and associated structures at mayapán '' , in mayapán yucatan mexico , edited by h.e.d
