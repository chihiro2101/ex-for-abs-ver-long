the smooth muscle of the bladder , known as the detrusor , is innervated by sympathetic nervous system fibers from the lumbar spinal cord and parasympathetic fibers from the sacrum spinal cord part of the urethra is surrounded by the male or female external urethral sphincter , which is innervated by the somatic pudendal nerve originating in the cord , in an area termed onuf 's nucleus smooth muscle bundles pass on either side of the urethra , and these fibers are sometimes called the internal urethral sphincter , although they do not encircle the urethra further along the urethra is a sphincter of skeletal muscle , the sphincter of the membranous urethra ( external urethral sphincter ) the bladder 's epithelium is termed transitional epithelium which contains a superficial layer of dome-like cells and multiple layers of stratified cuboidal cells underneath when evacuated when the bladder is fully distended the superficial cells become squamous ( flat ) and the stratification of the cuboidal cells is reduced in order to provide lateral stretching the physiology of micturition and the physiologic basis of its disorders are subjects about which there is much confusion , especially at the supraspinal level the state of the reflex system is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra at low bladder volumes , afferent firing is low , resulting in excitation of the outlet ( the sphincter and urethra ) , and relaxation of the bladder when the individual is ready to urinate , he or she consciously initiates voiding , causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax voiding continues until the bladder empties completely , at which point the bladder relaxes and the outlet contracts to re-initiate storage the muscles controlling micturition are controlled by the autonomic and somatic nervous systems during micturition , parasympathetic stimulation causes the detrusor muscle to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to relax the external urethral sphincter ( sphincter urethrae ) is under somatic control and is consciously relaxed during micturition the ability to voluntarily inhibit micturition develops by the age of 2â€“3 years , as control at higher levels of the central nervous system develops a plot of bladder ( intravesical ) pressure against the depressant of fluid in the bladder ( called a cystometrogram ) , will show a very slight rise as the bladder is filled since bladder wall stretch is low during the storage phase , these afferent neurons fire at low frequencies low-frequency afferent signals cause relaxation of the bladder by inhibiting sacral parasympathetic preganglionic neurons and exciting lumbar sympathetic preganglionic neurons conversely , afferent input causes contraction of the sphincter through excitation of onuf 's nucleus , and contraction of the bladder neck and urethra through excitation of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons diuresis ( production of urine by the kidney ) occurs constantly , and as the bladder becomes full , afferent firing increases , yet the micturition reflex can be voluntarily inhibited until it is appropriate to begin voiding bladder afferent signals ascend the spinal cord to the periaqueductal gray , where they project both to the pontine micturition center and to the cerebrum at a certain level of afferent activity , the conscious urge to void becomes difficult to ignore once the voluntary signal to begin voiding has been issued , neurons in pontine micturition center fire maximally , causing excitation of sacral preganglionic neurons the firing of these neurons causes the wall of the bladder to contract ; as a result , a sudden , sharp rise in intravesical pressure occurs the pontine micturition center also causes inhibition of onuf 's nucleus , resulting in relaxation of the external urinary sphincter elsevier after urination , the female urethra empties partially by gravity , with assistance from muscles for smaller mammals a different phenomenon occurs , where urine is discharged as droplets , and urination in smaller mammals , such as mice and rats , can occur in less than a second one possibility is that the voluntary relaxation of the muscles of the pelvic floor causes a sufficient downward tug on the detrusor muscle to initiate its contraction another possibility is the excitation or disinhibition of neurons in the pontine micturition center , which causes concurrent contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the sphincter in humans with lesions in the superior frontal gyrus , the desire to urinate is reduced and there is also difficulty in stopping micturition once it has commenced the bladder can be made to contract by voluntary facilitation of the spinal voiding reflex when it contains only a few milliliters of urine voiding can also be consciously interrupted once it has begun , through a contraction of the perineal muscles in females the need to urinate is felt in the lower abdomen region when the bladder is full in all three types the bladder contracts , but the contractions are generally not sufficient to empty the viscus completely , and residual urine is left in the bladder as these people may have difficulty urinating in the presence of others and will consequently avoid using urinals directly adjacent to another person the bladder becomes distended , thin-walled , and hypotonic , but there are some contractions because of the intrinsic response of the smooth muscle to stretch when the afferent and efferent nerves are both destroyed , as they may be by tumors of the cauda equina or filum terminale , the bladder is flaccid and distended for a while the reason for the difference between the small , hypertrophic bladder seen in this condition and the distended , hypotonic bladder seen when only the afferent nerves are interrupted is not known the hyperactive state in the former condition suggests the development of denervation hypersensitization even though the neurons interrupted are preganglionic rather than postganglionic during spinal shock , the bladder is flaccid and unresponsive after spinal shock has passed , a spinally mediated voiding reflex ensues , although there is no voluntary control and no inhibition or facilitation from higher centers due to the positions where the urethra exits the body , males and females often use different techniques for urination most males prefer to urinate standing while others prefer to urinate sitting or squatting elderly males with prostate gland enlargement may benefit from sitting down while in healthy males , no difference is found in the ability to urinate for practising muslim men , the genital modesty of squatting is also associated with proper cleanliness requirements or awrah it is common for women in various regions of africa to use this method when they urinate , as do women in laos a common technique used in many undeveloped nations involves holding the child by the backs of the thighs , above the ground , facing outward , in order to urinate babies have little socialized control over urination within traditions or families that do not practice elimination communication and instead use diapers while the primary purpose of urination is the same across the animal kingdom , urination often serves a social purpose beyond the expulsion of waste material instead , hyenas mark their territories using their anal glands , a trait found also in viverrids and mustelids , but not canids and felids raised-leg urination is the most significant form of scent marking in wolves , and is most frequent around the breeding season the odor of cheetah urine ( unlike that of other large felids ) can not be easily detected by humans
