when performing block-based discrete cosine transform ( dct ) coding for quantization , as in jpeg-compressed images , several types of artifacts can appear at low bit rates , any lossy block-based coding scheme introduces visible artifacts in pixel blocks and at block boundaries these boundaries can transform block boundaries , prediction block boundaries , or both , and may coincide with macroblock boundaries the term macroblocking is commonly used regardless of the artifact 's cause other names include tiling , mosaicing , pixelating , quilting , and checkerboarding block-artifacts are a result of the very principle of block transform coding the transform ( for example the discrete cosine transform ) is applied to a block of pixels , and to achieve lossy compression , the transform coefficients of each block are quantized statistically , images have more low-frequency than high-frequency content , so it is the low-frequency content that remains after quantization , which results in blurry , low-resolution blocks because this quantization process is applied individually in each block , neighboring blocks quantize coefficients differently block boundary discontinuities can occur at edges of motion compensation prediction blocks with low compression , a conservative psy-model is used with small block sizes when the psychoacoustic model is inaccurate , when the transform block size is restrained , or when aggressive compression is used , this may result in compression artifacts compression artifacts may intentionally be used as a visual style , sometimes known as glitch art
