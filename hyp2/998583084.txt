in 1962 the orchestra undertook its first tour of india , australia , and the far east the latter was appointed the lpo 's chief conductor in 1962 , presiding over what one player described as '' an era of supremely good taste '' the number of lpo concerts in the provinces fell during the 1960s , and ceased to be a major factor in the orchestra 's finances during the 1960s the orchestra gave fund-raising concerts in which guests from outside the world of classical music appeared , including danny kaye , duke ellington and tony bennett his concerts made a strong impression with the public , and within months the lpo was playing to ninety per cent capacity audiences at the festival hall , far outstripping the other london orchestras with vladimir ashkenazy , haitink and the lpo gave a six-concert cycle of the beethoven symphonies and piano concertos , for which the festival hall was full to capacity in the times , joan chissell described the orchestra 's playing as '' worthy of any festival '' there was some discontent within the lpo that haitink 's prolific recordings were almost always with the other orchestra of which he was the chief conductor , the amsterdam concertgebouw in the 1970s international tours continued , with itineraries taking in the us , western europe , the soviet union , and , in 1972 , china , long inaccessible to western musicians , where the orchestra met an enthusiastic welcome in 1973 the lpo was caught up in a recurring phenomenon of london orchestral life : the conviction in official circles that having four independent orchestras is too much for one city , and that two or more of the existing ensembles should merge on this occasion the targets were the lpo and the new philharmonia ; the latter , a self-governing body formed under its new name when the philharmonia was disbanded in 1964 , was going through a bad patch , professionally and financially guest conductors in the 1970s included erich leinsdorf , carlo maria giulini , eugen jochum , riccardo chailly , klaus tennstedt and solti when haitink announced in 1977 that he would step down as principal conductor at the end of the 1978–79 season , solti , who had been principal guest conductor since 1971 , agreed to succeed him in 1985 this tradition was broken with the recruitment of john willan , a qualified accountant as well as an alumnus of the royal academy of music and a successful recording producer for emi in august 1987 tennstedt , taken ill at a rehearsal , felt so unequal to continuing in his post that he resigned on the spot he continued to appear with the lpo as a guest , with the title of '' conductor laureate '' ; in 1989 richard morrison of the times wrote that the lpo still played better for tennstedt than for anyone else '' battered but unbowed , a maestro rebounds '' , the new york times , 13 november 1994 there were complaints that the orchestra 's high standards of playing were not consistently maintained welser-möst 's period as principal conductor coincided with the installation of the lpo as the sole resident orchestra of the festival hall this proved a mixed blessing : the southbank centre management now had a say over concert programming , and insisted on the inclusion of works by obscure composers which did severe damage to box-office receipts in the mid-1990s , the lpo released albums as a tribute to rock bands , such as led zeppelin , mike oldfield and pink floyd , with cover versions of songs by them beecham 's first discs with the orchestra were made in january 1933 , with his ballet suite the origin of design , arranged from music by handel for some years in the 1950s and 1960s the orchestra was contracted to two companies at once , and consequently appeared under the name '' the philharmonic promenade orchestra '' in some of its recordings in most lpo recordings for lyrita the conductor was boult ; in the same period he also recorded extensively for emi , with the lpo his preferred orchestra the orchestra lists among its best-selling recordings mahler 's eighth symphony , conducted by tennstedt , and works by rachmaninoff and tchaikovsky with jurowski '' london 2012 hands baton to london philharmonic orchestra '' , ipc , 15 april 2011
