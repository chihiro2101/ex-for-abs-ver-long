in asimov 's writings the endochronicity of thiotimoline is explained by the fact that in the thiotimoline molecule , there is at least one carbon atom such that , while two of the carbon 's four chemical bonds lie in normal spacetime , one of the bonds projects into the future and another into the past as he observed the crystals dissolve as soon as they hit the water 's surface , it occurred to him that if catechol were any more soluble , then it would dissolve before it encountered the water by that time asimov had been writing professionally for nine years and would soon write a doctoral dissertation asimov wrote the article on 8 june 1947 , but was uncertain as to whether the resulting work of fiction was publishable his examiners told him that they accepted his dissertation by asking a final question about thiotimoline , resulting in him having to be led from the room while laughing hysterically with relief the article made asimov famous for the first time outside science fiction , as chemists shared copies of the article in 1952 , asimov wrote a second spoof scientific paper on thiotimoline called '' the micropsychiatric applications of thiotimoline '' it also expounds a putative rationale for thiotimoline 's behaviour : namely that the chemical bonds in the compound 's structural formula are so starved of space that some are forced into the time dimension according to the second article , thiotimoline 's time of solubility varies depending on the determination of the person adding the water the first two thiotimoline '' articles '' appeared together in asimov 's first collection of science essays , only a trillion ( 1957 ) , under the joint title '' the marvellous properties of thiotimoline '' in his address , asimov '' describes '' his first experiments with thiotimoline in july 1947 , and timing the compound 's dissolution with the original endochronometer , '' the same instrument now at the smithsonian '' finally , asimov describes attempts to create a '' heisenberg failure '' , to get a sample of thiotimoline to dissolve without later adding water to it he then concludes with some speculation about thiotimoline 's potential applications as a weapon of mass destruction by deliberately using it to artificially induce hurricanes asimov 's final piece on thiotimoline was a short story titled '' thiotimoline to the stars '' , which he wrote for harry harrison 's astounding ( 1973 ) spider robinson 's story '' mirror mirror , off the wall '' , published in time travelers strictly cash in 1981 , also references thiotimoline
