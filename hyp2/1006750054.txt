karl drais included a pivoting brake shoe that could be pressed against the rear iron tyre of his 1817 laufmaschine this was continued on the earliest bicycles with pedals , such as the boneshaker , which were fitted with a spoon brake to press onto the rear wheel the rider could also slow down by resisting the pedals of the fixed wheel drive however , as the rear wheel became smaller and smaller , with more of the rider 's weight over the front wheel , braking on the rear wheel became less effective the front brake , introduced by john kean in 1873 , had been generally adopted by 1880 because of its greater stopping power some penny-farthing riders used only back pedalling and got off and walked down steep hills , but most also used a brake putting the legs under the handlebars with the feet off the pedals placed on foot-rests on the forks had resulted in serious accidents caused by the feet getting caught in the spokes an alternative to the spoon brake for penny-farthings was the caliper brake patented by browett and harrison in 1887 this early version of caliper braking used a rubber block to contact the outside of the penny-farthing 's small rear tyre the relative fragility of the wooden rims used on most bicycles still precluded the use of rim brakes with the introduction of mass-produced bicycle tire by the dunlop rubber , the use of spoon brakes began to decline , as they tended to quickly wear through the thin casing of the new tyres duck of duck 's cyclery in oakland , california was granted a patent for his duck roller brake ( u.s , united states patent office , letters patent no 594,234 , november 23 , 1897 the duck brake used a rod operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin rubber rollers against the front tyre , braking the front wheel 594,234 in 1898 , after the advent of freewheel coasting mechanisms , the first internal coaster brakes were introduced for the rear wheel the coaster brake was contained in the rear wheel hub , and was engaged and controlled by backpedaling , thus eliminating the issue of tyre wear the spoon brake , or plunger brake was probably the first type of bicycle brake and precedes the pneumatic tyre whittbs , pp.153 & ndash ; 154 spoon brakes were used on penny farthings with solid rubber tyres in the 1800s and continued to be used after the introduction of the pneumatic-tyred safety bicycle the spoon brake consists of a pad ( often leather ) or metal shoe ( possibly rubber faced ) , which is pressed onto the top of the front tyre in developing world , a foot-operated form of the spoon brake sometimes is retrofitted to old rod brake roadsters it consists of a spring-loaded flap attached to the back of the fork crown perhaps more so than any other form of bicycle brake , the spoon brake is sensitive to road conditions and increases tyre wear dramatically jpg spoon brake on front wheel file : marian038.jpg improvised spoon brake on a chinese cargo tricycle 198-233 : the spoon brake was fairly ineffective , while the coaster brake did not operate on the front tyre , the most effective position on a two-wheel vehicle during a hard stop parliamentary debates : senate and house of representatives , tariff preferences , volume 34 ( 19 september 1906 ) , p bill was granted a patent for an improved version of the duck roller brake ( patent 708,114 ) for use on motorized bicycles ( motorcycles ) , united states patent office , letters patent no brake pads can be made of leather , rubber or cork and are often mounted in metal '' shoes '' however , they perform relatively poorly when the rims are wet , and will brake unevenly if the rims are even slightly warped the light weight of rim brakes also makes them desirable in road racing bicycles if a rim has a pronounced wobble , then the braking force may be intermittent or uneven , and the pads may rub the rims even when the brake is not applied however , on a heavily laden bike on a long descent , heat energy may be added more quickly than it can dissipate causing heat build-up , which may damage components and cause brake failure the rubber can be softer for more braking force with less lever effort , or harder for longer life many pad designs have a rectangular shape ; others are longer and curved to match the radius of the rim this wedges the shoes higher upon the tapered rim , thus increasing the normal force between shoes and rim surface thus the front brake is typically more effective than the rear when the brakes are so mounted the following are among the many sub-types of rim brakes : rim brakes have been the subject of countless '' engineering innovations '' the rear linkage mechanism is complicated by the need to allow rotation where the fork and handlebars attach to the frame arms extend around the tyre and end in brake shoes that press against the rim but they are almost ubiquitous on road bikes , particularly the side-pull caliper brakes '' single-pivot side-pull caliper brakes '' consist of two curved arms that cross at a pivot above the wheel and hold the brake pads on opposite sides of the rim these arms have extensions on one side , one attached to the cable , the other to the cable housing these brakes are now used on inexpensive bikes ; before the introduction of dual-pivot caliper brakes they were used on all types of road bikes tension on the cable is evenly distributed to the two arms , preventing the brake from taking a '' set '' to one side or the other these brakes were reasonably priced , and in the past filled the price niche between the cheaper and the more expensive models of side-pull brakes it is important that the fixed bridge holding the pivots is very stiff '' u-brakes '' ( also known by the trademarked term '' 990-style '' ) are essentially the same design as the centre-pull caliper brake u-brakes were used on mountain bikes through the early 1990s , particularly under the chainstays , a rear brake mounting location that was then popular both first- and second-class lever designs exist ; second-class is by far the most common the brake shoe is mounted above the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are drawn together in the first-class lever design , the arm pivots above the rim the brake shoe is mounted below the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are forced apart thus cantilever brake shoes are notoriously difficult to adjust eventually , one may go underneath the rim , so that the brake does not function accordingly , they are usually found only on bicycles without suspension however , the arms are longer , with the cable housing attached to one arm and the cable to the other since there is no intervening mechanism between the cable and the arms , the design is called '' direct-pull '' and since the arms move the same distance that the cable moves with regard to its housing , the design is also called '' linear-pull '' some high-end v-brakes use a four-pivot parallel motion so the brake pads contact at virtually the same position on the wheel rim regardless of wear because of the higher mechanical advantage of v-brakes , they require brake levers with longer cable travel than levers intended for older types of brakes in particular , with a small parallelogram , pad wear causes mechanical advantage to rise dramatically unlike some rarer rim brake designs , disc brakes are compatible with bicycle suspension smaller rotors provide less stopping power but also less weight and better protection from knocks 245 : '' the front brake therefore has to provide 90 percent of the total retarding force at a deceleration of 0.5 g
