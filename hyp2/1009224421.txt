the names somatotropin ( sth ) or somatotropic hormone refer to the growth hormone produced naturally in animals and extracted from carcasses hormone extracted from human cadavers is abbreviated hgh since its introduction in 1992 humatrope has been a banned sports doping agent , and in this context is referred to as hgh gh , human chorionic somatomammotropin , and prolactin belong to somatotropin family with growth-promoting and lactogenic activity the major isoform of the human growth hormone is a protein of 191 amino acids and a molecular weight of 22,124 daltons despite marked structural similarities between growth hormone from different species , only human and old world monkey growth hormones have significant effects on the human growth hormone receptor this variant has not been identified , but it has been suggested to coincide with a 22 kda glycosylated variant of 23 kda identified in the pituitary gland furthermore , these variants circulate partially bound to a protein ( growth hormone-binding protein , ghbp ) , which is the truncated part of the growth hormone receptor , and an acid-labile subunit ( als ) secretion of growth hormone ( gh ) in the pituitary is regulated by the neurosecretion nuclei of the hypothalamus these cells release the peptides growth hormone-releasing hormone ( ghrh or somatocrinin ) and somatostatin ( ghih or somatostatin ) into the hypophyseal portal venous blood surrounding the pituitary gh release in the pituitary is primarily determined by the balance of these two peptides , which in turn is affected by many physiological stimulators ( e.g somatotropic cells in the anterior pituitary gland then synthesize and secrete gh in a pulsatile manner , in response to these stimuli by the hypothalamus the largest and most predictable of these gh peaks occurs about an hour after onset of sleep with plasma levels of 13 to 72 & nbsp ; ng/ml nearly fifty percent of gh secretion occurs during the third and fourth nrem sleep stages between the peaks , basal gh levels are low , usually less than 5 & nbsp ; ng/ml for most of the day and night a number of factors are known to affect gh secretion , such as age , sex , diet , exercise , stress , and other hormones young adolescents secrete gh at the rate of about 700 μg/day , while healthy adults secrete gh at the rate of about 400 μg/day effects of growth hormone on the tissues of the body can generally be described as anabolic ( building up ) height appears to be stimulated by at least two mechanisms : because polypeptide hormones are not fat-soluble , they can not penetrate cell membranes these somatotroph adenomas are benign and grow slowly , gradually producing more and more gh for years , the principal clinical problems are those of gh excess in some circumstances , focused radiation or a gh antagonist such as pegvisomant may be employed to shrink the tumor or block function major manifestations of gh deficiency in children are growth failure , the development of a short stature , and delayed sexual maturity in adults , somatomedin alteration contributes to increased osteoclast activity , resulting in weaker bones that are more prone to pathologic fracture and osteoporosis other adult causes include a continuation of a childhood problem , other structural lesions or injury , and very rarely idiopathic ghd at the conclusion of the study , all the men showed statistically significant increases in lean body mass and bone mineral density , while the control group did not athletes in many sports have used human growth hormone in order to attempt to enhance their athletic performance very limited clinical studies of growth hormone derived from an old world monkey , the rhesus macaque , were conducted by john c in 1985 , biosynthetic human growth hormone replaced pituitary-derived human growth hormone for therapeutic use in the u.s
