there is no provision for the role of political parties in the united states constitution , since the founding fathers did not originally intend for american politics to be partisan 10 , alexander hamilton and james madison , respectively , wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic political factions thus in the first two presidential elections , the electoral college handled the nominations and elections in 1789 and 1792 that selected george washington richard hofstadter , the idea of a party system : the rise of legitimate opposition in the united states , 1780–1840 ( 1970 ) gordon s that system collapsed in 1824 , and since 1832 the preferred mechanism for nomination has been a national convention the first national convention was called by the anti-masonic party in 1831 , as they could not use the caucus system because they had no congressmen the party leaders instead called for a national meeting of supporters to set the party 's candidate delegates to the national convention were usually selected at state conventions whose own delegates were chosen by district conventions progressive era reformers looked to the primary election as a way to measure popular opinion of candidates , as opposed to the opinion of the bosses the wisconsin direct open primary of 1905 was the first to eliminate the caucus and mandate direct selection of national convention delegates in 1910 , oregon became the first state to establish a presidential preference primary , which requires delegates to the national convention to support the winner of the primary at the convention by 1912 , twelve states either selected delegates in primaries , used a preferential primary , or both seeking to boost voter turnout , new hampshire simplified its ballot access laws in 1949 in the ensuing non-binding '' beauty contest '' of 1952 , republican dwight eisenhower demonstrated his broad voter appeal by out-polling the favored robert a the first-in-the-nation new hampshire primary has since become a widely observed test of candidates ' viability a major reason states try to increase their influence , and vie for earlier primaries , is that in recent years the races have usually been decided before the primary season has ended in june for example , john mccain officially clinched the 2008 republican presidential nomination in march , while during that same month barack obama held a substantial lead in pledged delegates in the democratic party primaries in response , other states also changed their primary election dates for 2012 , in order to claim a greater influence , creating a cascade of changes in other states both parties then enacted stricter timing rules for 2016 : primaries and caucuses can not start until february 1 ; and only iowa , new hampshire , south carolina and nevada are entitled to february contests both the democratic and republican parties , as well as other third parties , have agreed to let these territories participate in the presidential nomination process for presidents ronald reagan , bill clinton , george w serious challenges are rare , but then generally presage failure to win the general election in the fall bush during the 1992 republican primaries , but only received a handful of delegates ; bush too subsequently went on to lose in the general election to clinton both major political parties of the u.s.—the democratic party and the republican party—officially nominate their candidate for president at their respective national conventions each of these conventions is attended by a number of delegates selected in accordance with the given party 's bylaws the results of the presidential primaries and caucuses bind many of these delegates , known as pledged delegates , to vote for a particular candidate republicans have three at-large delegates selected at the state convention from all the states and territories , 168 in number in democratic primaries through 2016 , about 85 % of delegates to the democratic national convention are '' pledged delegates '' who are apportioned to candidates according to the results of primaries and caucuses the remaining 15 % are unpledged superdelegates ( consisting of sitting democratic governors , sitting democratic members of congress ( i.e , senators and representatives ) , former and current democratic presidents and vice presidents , and a few leaders of democratic national committee-affiliated organizations , such as the young democrats of america ) who can vote for whomever they wish in 2016 , following a push by senator bernie sanders , burgess everett & seung min kim , sanders ' anti-superdelegate push gains steam in senate , politico ( june 21 , 2016 ) franchise in a primary or caucus is governed by rules established by the state party , although the states may impose other regulations one disadvantage of caucuses is that the state party runs the process directly instead of having the state and local governments run them some binding primaries are winner-take-all contests , in which all of a state 's delegates are required to vote for the same candidate in a proportional vote , a state 's delegation is allocated in proportion to the candidates ' percent of the popular vote in a congressional district in many of those states that have proportional vote primaries , a candidate must meet a certain threshold in the popular vote to be given delegates in some states , a semi-closed primary is practiced , in which voters unaffiliated with a party ( independents ) may choose a party primary in which to vote a semi-open primary occurs when a voter must choose a party-specific ballot to cast , instead of being provided a single ballot where the voter must choose on the ballot itself which party 's primary to vote in a few states once staged a blanket primary , in which voters could vote for one candidate in multiple primaries , but the practice was struck down by the u.s under the current democratic party selection rules , adopted in 2006 , pledged delegates are selected under proportional representation , which requires a candidate have a minimum of 15 % of a state 's popular vote to receive delegates each state publishes a delegate selection plan that notes the mechanics of calculating the number of delegates per congressional district , and how votes are transferred from local conventions to the state and national convention since the 2012 democratic primaries , the number of pledged delegates allocated to each of the 50 u.s is based on two main factors : ( 1 ) the proportion of votes each state gave to the democratic candidate in the last three presidential elections , and ( 2 ) the number of electoral votes each state has in the united states electoral college house of representatives , and whether its electoral college votes went to the republican candidate in the last presidential election each party 's bylaws also specify which current and former elected officeholders and party leaders qualify as unpledged delegates because of possible deaths , resignations , or the results of intervening or special elections , the final number of these superdelegates may not be known until the week of the convention if no single candidate has secured a majority of delegates ( including both pledged and unpledged ) during the first vote , then a '' brokered convention '' results all pledged delegates are then '' released '' and are able to switch their allegiance to a different candidate thereafter , the nomination is decided through a process of alternating political horse trading , and additional rounds of re-votes campaigning for president often begins almost a year before the new hampshire primary , almost two years before the presidential election in 2020 , a decisive win in the south carolina primary helped former united states vice president joe biden win the democratic party u.s in such a primary season , however , many primaries will fall on the same day , forcing candidates to choose where to spend their time and resources contrary to most reform plans , this would reduce the ability of lesser-funded candidates to build up from small contests to large ones for republicans , states with more than 30 delegates that violate the timing rules will be deprived of all their delegates but nine ; states with less than 30 will be reduced to six sabato , larry , politics : america 's missing constitutional link , virginia quarterly review , summer 2006 , 149–61
