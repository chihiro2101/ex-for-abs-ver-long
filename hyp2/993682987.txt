recursion theory originated in the 1930s , with work of kurt gödel , alonzo church , rózsa péter , alan turing , stephen kleene , and emil post the fundamental results the researchers obtained established computable function as the correct formalization of the informal idea of effective calculation these results led stephen kleene ( 1952 ) to coin the two names '' church 's thesis '' ( kleene 1952:300 ) and '' turing 's thesis '' ( kleene 1952:376 ) nowadays these are often considered as a single hypothesis , the church–turing thesis , which states that any function that is computable by an algorithm is a computable function although initially skeptical , by 1946 gödel argued in favor of this thesis : : '' tarski has stressed in his lecture ( and i think justly ) the great importance of the concept of general recursiveness ( or turing 's computability ) the full paper can also be found at pages 150ff ( with commentary by charles parsons at 144ff ) in feferman et al church ( 1936a , 1936b ) and turing ( 1936 ) , inspired by techniques used by gödel ( 1931 ) to prove his incompleteness theorems , independently demonstrated that the entscheidungsproblem is not effectively decidable this result showed that there is no algorithmic procedure that can correctly decide whether arbitrary mathematical propositions are true or false the study of which mathematical constructions can be effectively performed is sometimes called recursive mathematics ; the handbook of recursive mathematics ( ershov et al the main form of computability studied in recursion theory was introduced by turing ( 1936 ) the use of turing machines here is not necessary ; there are many other model of computation that have the same computing power as turing machines ; for example the mu-recursive function obtained from primitive recursion and the μ operator the existence of many noncomputable sets follows from the facts that there are only countable set turing machines , and thus only countably many computable sets , but according to the cantor 's theorem , there are uncountable set sets of natural numbers although the halting problem is not computable , it is possible to simulate program execution and produce an infinite list of the programs that do halt equivalently , a set is recursively enumerable if and only if it is the range of some computable function the recursively enumerable sets , although not decidable in general , have been studied in detail in recursion theory recursion theory in mathematical logic has traditionally focused on relative computability , a generalization of turing computability defined using oracle turing machines , introduced by turing & nbsp ; ( 1939 ) an oracle turing machine is a hypothetical device which , in addition to performing the actions of a regular turing machine , is able to ask questions of an oracle , which is a particular set of natural numbers thus an oracle machine with a noncomputable oracle will be able to compute sets that a turing machine without an oracle can not this study was initiated by harvey friedman and was studied in detail by stephen simpson and others ; simpson ( 1999 ) gives a detailed discussion of the program a numbering is an enumeration of functions ; it has two parameters , e and x and outputs the value of the e-th function in the numbering on the input x numberings can be partial-recursive although some of its members are total recursive , that is , computable functions a friedberg numbering ( named after its discoverer ) is a one-one numbering of all partial-recursive functions ; it is necessarily not an admissible numbering goncharov discovered for example a class of recursively enumerable sets for which the numberings fall into exactly two classes with respect to recursive isomorphisms post 's problem was solved with a method called the priority method ; a proof using this method is called a priority argument each requirement is assigned to a natural number representing the priority of the requirement ; so 0 is assigned to the most important priority , 1 to the second most important , and so on because complex priority arguments can be technical and difficult to follow , it has traditionally been considered desirable to prove results without priority arguments , or to see if results proved with priority arguments can also be proved without them the fact that certain sets are computable or relatively computable often implies that these sets can be defined in weak subsystems of second order arithmetic he argues that turing 's terminology using the word '' computable '' is more natural and more widely understood than the terminology using the word '' recursive '' introduced by kleene according to rogers , the sets of interest in recursion theory are the noncomputable sets , partitioned into equivalence classes by computable bijections of the natural numbers
