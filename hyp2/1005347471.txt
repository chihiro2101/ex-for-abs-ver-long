all feature layers of octahedron aluminium hydroxide units , with hydrogen bonds between the layers nonetheless , both gibbsite and hydrargillite refer to the same polymorphism of aluminium hydroxide , with gibbsite used most commonly in the united states and hydrargillite used more often in europe virtually all the aluminium hydroxide used commercially is manufactured by the bayer process which involves dissolving bauxite in sodium hydroxide at temperatures up to the waste solid , bauxite tailings , is removed and aluminium hydroxide is precipitated from the remaining solution of sodium aluminate this aluminium hydroxide can be converted to aluminium oxide or alumina by calcination the residue or bauxite tailings , which is mostly iron oxide , is highly caustic due to residual sodium hydroxide it was historically stored in lagoons ; this led to the ajka alumina plant accident in 2010 in hungary , where a dam bursting led to the drowning of nine people while the mud was considered non-toxic due to low levels of heavy metals , the associated slurry had a ph of 13 it is selected for these applications because it is colorless ( like most polymers ) , inexpensive , and has good fire retardant properties one of the well-known brands of aluminium hydroxide adjuvant is alhydrogel , made by brenntag biosector
