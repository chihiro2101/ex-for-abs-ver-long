the word tsetse means '' fly '' in tswana , a bantu language of southern africa recently , tsetse without the fly has become more common in english , particularly in the scientific and development communities during world war ii , a de havilland antisubmarine aircraft was known as the 'tsetse ' mosquito they have been extensively studied because of their medical , veterinary , and economic importances , because the flies can be raised in a laboratory , and because they are relatively large , facilitating their analysis tsetse first become separate from their mothers during the third larval instar , during which they have the typical appearance of maggots however , this life stage is short , lasting at most a few hours , and is almost never observed outside of the laboratory within the puparial shell , tsetse complete the last two larval instars and the pupal stage brucei infective to humans requires a more complex explanation these diseases reduce the growth rate , milk productivity , and strength of farm animals , generally leading to the eventual death of the infected animals certain species of cattle are called trypanotolerant because they can survive and grow even when infected with trypanosomes although they also have lower productivity rates when infected other forms of animal trypanosomiasis are also known from other areas of the globe , caused by different species of trypanosomes and transmitted without the intervention of the tsetse fly trypanosomiasis poses a considerable constraint on livestock agricultural development in tsetse fly infested areas of sub saharan africa , especially in west and central africa the conquest of sleeping sickness and nagana would be of immense benefit to rural development and contribute to poverty alleviation and improved food security in sub-saharan africa area-wide interventions against the tsetse and trypanosomosis problem appear more efficient and profitable if sufficiently large areas , with high numbers of cattle , can be covered to ensure sustainability of the results , it is critical to apply the control tactics on an area-wide basis , i.e many techniques have reduced tsetse populations , with earlier , crude methods recently replaced by methods that are cheaper , more directed , and ecologically better one early technique involved slaughtering all the wild animals tsetse fed on for example , the island of principe off the west coast of africa was entirely cleared of feral pigs in the 1930s , which led to the extirpation of the fly tsetse tend to rest on the trunks of trees so removing woody vegetation made the area inhospitable to the flies preventing regrowth of woody vegetation requires continuous clearing efforts , which is only practical where large human populations are present the sterile males are released systematically from the ground or by air in tsetse-infested areas , where they mate with wild females , which do not produce offspring in the literature of environmental determinism , the tsetse has been linked to difficulties during early state formation for areas where the fly is prevalent the authors also suggest that under a lower burden of tsetse , africa would have developed differently , great zimbabwe is located in the african highlands where the fly does not occur , and represented the largest and technically most advanced precolonial structure in sub-sahara africa he published : a naturalist on lake victoria , with an account of sleeping sickness and the tse-tse fly ; 1920
