the technique relies on the ability of the eye and mind of the viewer to blend the color spots into a fuller range of tones divisionism is concerned with color theory , whereas pointillism is more focused on the specific style of brushwork used to apply the paint it is a technique with few serious practitioners today and is notably seen in the works of seurat , signac and cross however , see also andy warhol 's early works and pop art from 1905 to 1907 , robert delaunay and jean metzinger painted in a divisionist style with large squares or 'cubes ' of color : the size and direction of each gave a sense of rhythm to the painting , yet color varied independently of size and placement pointillism is analogous to the four-color cmyk printing process used by some color printers and large presses that place dots of cyan , magenta , yellow and key ( black ) different musical notes are made in seclusion , rather than in a linear sequence , giving a sound texture similar to the painting version of pointillism
