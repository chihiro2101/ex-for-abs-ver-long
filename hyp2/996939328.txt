the numbers go from one to nine ( 1-9 ) for headers and one to ten ( 1-10 ) for heelers there is specialized equipment used by team ropers : rope - made of synthetic fibers , used to rope the steer , there are two kinds of ropes , one for the header ( the person who ropes the head ) and one for the heeler ( the person who ropes the legs ) the header 's rope is usually 30 to 32 feet in length and is a lot softer ( softer means the rope has more elasticity and flexibility ) horn wraps - protective wraps that go around the horns of the steer to prevent rope burns and reduce the risk of a horn breaking when roped steers used for roping are moved from a holding corral through a series of narrow alleyways that lead to the roping arena then , one at a time , a steer is moved into a chute with spring-loaded doors in front and a solid gate behind , so that only one animal is released at a time the header is on one side ( usually the left , for a right-handed header ) whose job is to rope the steer around the horns , then turn the steer so its hind legs can be roped by the '' heeler '' , who starts from the box on the other side of the chute a taut rope , called the barrier , runs in front of the header 's box and is fastened to an easily released rope on the neck of the steer of a designated length , used to ensure that the steer gets a head start there is a 5-second penalty for roping only one hind leg and a 10-second penalty for breaking the barrier if both occur on the same run then the penalties are added together for a total of 15 seconds added at higher levels , the header and the heeler are allowed only one throw each , if either misses , the team gets no score
