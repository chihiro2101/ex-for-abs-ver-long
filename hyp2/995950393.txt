the mistle thrush was first described by carl linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of systema naturae under its current scientific name the bird 's liking for mistletoe berries is also indicated by its english name , '' mistle '' being an old name for the plant they are less closely related to other european thrush species such as the blackbird ( t merula ) which are descended from ancestors that had colonised the caribbean islands from africa and subsequently reached europe from there at least eight subspecies have been proposed , but the differences between them are mainly clinal , with birds being paler and less densely spotted in the east of the range turdus viscivorus viscivorus , named by linnaeus , 1758 , the nominate subspecies an isolated population in crimea has sometimes been separated as t mistle thrush fossils have been found in pleistocene deposits from poland and sicily juveniles are similar to adults , but they have paler upperparts with creamy centres to many of the feathers and smaller spots on the yellowish underparts bonapartei is in length , and therefore slightly larger than the nominate form birds of intermediate appearance are seen west of the ob river where the range overlaps with viscivorus deichleri resembles bonapartei in appearance , but is closer in size to the nominate viscivorus , although it has a more slender bill adults have a full moult after breeding , beginning between late may and the end of june , and completed by early october juvenile birds have a partial moult , replacing their head , body , and covert feathers ; this is completed by october , although the start of the moult depends on when the chicks hatched these are similar to the mistle thrush , but the plainâ€“backed thrush lacks obvious wing bars , is more rufous above than its relative , and is barred rather than spotted below juvenile mistle thrushes are superficially similar to white 's thrush , but that species has golden-yellow plumage , scalloped underparts and a distinctive underwing pattern the male mistle thrush has a loud melodious song with fluted whistles , sounding like chewee-trewuu & nbsp ; the tone resembles that of the song thrush or blackbird , but compared to its relatives the mistle thrush 's repertoire is less varied and the delivery is slower the male is most vocal in the early morning , and its tendency to sing after , and sometimes during , wet and windy weather led to the old name '' stormcock '' it is often likened to the sound of a football rattle , a form of musical ratchet in these warmer southern areas , it tends to be found in the milder uplands and coastal regions the mistle thrush is a partial migrant : birds from the north and east of the range wintering in the milder areas of europe and north africa between mid-october and november , large numbers cross the strait of gibraltar and others pass through cyprus , but there is hardly any migration across the north sea migration may be by day or night , and typically involves individuals or small groups in the south and east of its range , it inhabits upland coniferous woodland and the range extends above the main tree line where dwarf juniper is present in areas of intensive farming , such as eastern england , arable land has in turn largely been abandoned in favour of built-up areas with their greater variety of green habitats perhaps the most notable find of the 118th christmas bird count in canada was a single vagrant mistle thrush found in miramichi , new brunswick they roost at night in trees or bushes , again typically as individuals or pairs , except in late summer or autumn when families may roost together the mistle thrush is quite terrestrial , hopping with its head held up and body erect ; when excited , it will flick its wings and tail the flight consists of undulating bounds interspersed with glides their territories are much larger than those of blackbirds or song thrushes ; although the nest territory is only about , around is used for feeding the male will attack intruders into its breeding area , including birds of prey and corvids , and sometimes cats or humans courtship feeding of the female by her partner has sometimes been observed breeding typically commences in mid-march in the south and west of europe ( late february in britain ) , but not till early may in finland in milder winters with an abundance of fruit , however , this strategy is less used and thrushes can be observed foraging in flocks the song of the mistle thrush is also described in thomas hardy 's '' darkling thrush '' and edward thomas 's '' the thrush ''
