the chinese concept of the world was largely a division between the civilized world and the barbarian world and there was little concept of the belief that chinese interests were served by a powerful chinese state chinese nationalism as it emerged in the early 20th century was based on the experience of european nationalism , especially as viewed and interpreted by sun yat-sen the key factor in european nationalism was tradition – some of the newly manufactured – of a cultural identity based primarily on language and ethnicity chinese nationalism was rooted in the long historic tradition of china as the center of the world , in which all other states were offshoots and owed some sort of deference the most dramatic watershed came in 1900 , in the wake of the invasion , capture , and pillaging of the national capital by an eight-nation coalition that punished china for the boxer rebellion most citizens had multiple identities , of which the locality was more important than the nation as a whole anyone who wanted to rise in government non-military service had to be immersed in confucian classics , and pass a very difficult test if accepted , they would be rotated around the country , so the bureaucrats did not identify with the locality political scientist suisheng zhao argues that nationalism in china is not monolithic but exists in various forms , including political , liberal , ethnical , and state nationalism shaped by the global discourse of social darwinism , reformers and intellectuals debated how to build a new chinese national subject based on a proper racial order , particularly the man-han relations while intellectuals and elites advocated their distinctive thoughts on chinese nationalism , political scientist chalmers johnson has pointed out that most of these ideas had very little to do with china 's majority population -- the chinese peasantry he thus proposes to supplement the chinese communist ideology in the discussion of chinese nationalism , which he labels '' peasant nationalism '' chinese nationalism in the early twentieth century was primarily based on anti-manchurism , an ideology that was prevalent among chinese revolutionaries from late nineteenth century to the turn of the twentieth century liang qichao , a late qing reformist who participated in the hundred days ' reform of 1898 , contended that the boundary between han and man must be erased ( ping man-han zhi jie ) liang 's critique of the qing court and the man-han relations laid the foundation for anti-manchuism , an ideology that early republican revolutionaries advocated in their efforts to overthrow the qing dynasty and found a new republic according to zou , the han chinese , as the descendants of the yellow emperor , must overthrow the manchu rule to restore their legitimacy and rights most of the republican revolutionaries agreed that preserving the race was vital to the survival of the nation the rhetorical move , as china historian joseph esherick points out , was based on the practical concerns of both imperial threats from the international environment and conflicts on the chinese frontiers pressured by both domestic and international problems , the fragile republican regime decided to maintain the borders of the qing empire to keep its territories intact an ideal of '' a morally just universe , '' anti-imperialism made racism appear shameful and thus took over its dominant role in the conceptualization of chinese nationalism '' johnson observes that social mobilization , a force that unites people to form a political community together , is the '' primary tool '' for conceptualizing nationalism the wartime alliance of the chinese peasantry and the ccp manifests how the nationalist ideology of the ccp , or the peasant nationalism , reinforced the desire of the chinese to save and build a strong nation during the 1960s and 1970s , chinese nationalism within mainland china became mixed with the rhetoric of marxism , and nationalistic rhetoric become in large part subsumed into internationalist rhetoric on the other hand , chinese nationalism in taiwan was primarily about preserving the ideals and lineage of sun yat-sen , the party he founded , the kuomintang ( kmt ) , and anti-communism while the definition of chinese nationalism differed in the republic of china ( roc ) and the people 's republic of china ( prc ) , both are adamant in claiming chinese territories such as the senkaku islands and the nine-dash line in the south china sea defining the relationship between ethnicity and the chinese identity has been a very complex issue throughout chinese history hu songshan , a muslim imam from ningxia , was a chinese nationalist and preached chinese nationalism and unity of all chinese people , and also against foreign imperialism and other threats to china 's sovereignty hu songshan led the ikhwan , the chinese muslim brotherhood , which became a chinese nationalist , patriotic organization , stressing education and independence of the individual he read classic chinese texts and even took his cue from laozi when he decided to go on hajj to mecca ma fuxiang , a chinese muslim general and kuomintang member , was another chinese nationalist ma fuxiang preached unity of all chinese people , and even non-han chinese people such as tibetans and mongols to stay in china he proclaimed that mongolia and tibet were part of the republic of china , and not independent countries 167 ma fuxiang was loyal to the chinese government , and crushed muslim rebels when ordered to ma fuxiang led an ambush against the foreigners at langfang and inflicted many casualties , using a train to escape various muslim organizations in china like china islamic association ( zhongguo huijiao gonghui ) and the chinese muslim association were sponsored by the kuomintang chinese muslim imams had synthesized islam and confucianism in the han kitab chinese muslim students returning from study abroad , from places such as al-azhar university in egypt , learned about nationalism and advocated chinese nationalism at home one imam , wang jingzhai , who studied at mecca , translated a hadith , or saying of muhammad , '' aiguo aijiao '' - loving the country is equivalent to loving the faith general bai chongxi , the warlord of guangxi , and a member of the kuomintang , presented himself as the protector of islam in china and harbored muslim intellectuals fleeing from the japanese invasion in guangxi ma bufang , a chinese muslim general who was part of the kuomintang , supported chinese nationalism and tolerance between the different chinese ethnic groups in xinjiang , the chinese muslim general ma hushan supported chinese nationalism ma hushan proclaimed his loyalty to nanjing , denounced sheng shicai as a soviet puppet , and fought against soviet invasion in 1937 the tungans ( chinese muslims , hui people ) had anti-japanese sentiment the 36th division had crushed the turkish islamic republic of east turkestan , and the chinese muslim general ma zhancang beheaded the uighur emirs abdullah bughra and nur ahmad jan bughra the uighur warlord yulbars khan was pro-china and supported the republic of china many of the chinese troops used to occupation of mongolia were chahars , which has been a major cause for animosity between khalkhas and inner mongols while this was the commonly stated goal of both the people 's republic of china and the republic of china ( roc ) especially before 1991 , both sides differed sharply in the form of unification due to obvious and salient differences in political ideology in taiwan , there is currently a general consensus to support the status quo of taiwan 's political status overt support for formal independence is also muted due to the prc 's insistence on military action should taiwan make such a formal declaration because the 2008 summer olympics were a major source of national pride , anti-olympics sentiments are often seen as anti-chinese sentiments inside china sbs dateline , 6 august 2008 similarly , the yasukuni shrine website was hacked by chinese
