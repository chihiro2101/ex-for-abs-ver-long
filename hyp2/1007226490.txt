quorum sensing was first reported in 1970 , by kenneth nealson , terry platt , and j some of the best-known examples of quorum sensing come from studies of bacteria bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate certain phenotype expressions , which in turn , coordinate their behaviours some common phenotypes include biofilm formation , virulence factor expression , and motility certain bacteria are able to use quorum sensing to regulate bioluminescence , nitrogen fixation and spore the quorum-sensing function is based on the local density of the bacterial population in the immediate environment it can occur within a single bacterial species , as well as between diverse species both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria use quorum sensing , but there are some major differences in their mechanisms this process is highly dependent on the diffusion mechanism of the signaling molecules qs signaling molecules are usually secreted at a low level by individual bacteria gram-positive bacteria use autoinducing peptides ( aip ) as their autoinducers the kinase phosphorylates a transcription factor , which regulates gene transcription another possible mechanism is that aip is transported into the cytosol , and binds directly to a transcription factor to initiate or inhibit transcription usually ahls do not need additional processing , and bind directly to transcription factors to regulate gene expression it lives as a mutualistic symbiont in the photophore ( or light-producing organ ) of the hawaiian bobtail squid fischeri cells are free-living ( or planktonic ) , the autoinducer is at low concentration , and , thus , cells do not show luminescence however , when the population reaches the threshold in the photophore ( about cells/ml ) , transcription of luciferase is induced , leading to bioluminescence curvibacter is a gram-negative curved rod-formed bacterium which is the main colonizer of the epithelial cell surfaces of the early branching metazoan hydra vulgaris as mentioned before , ahl are the quorum sensing molecules of gram-negative bacteria , which means curvibacter has a quorum sensing activity even though their function in host-microbe interaction is largely unknown , curvibacter quorum-sensing signals are relevant for host-microbe interactions the most likely explanation is that the binding of 3-oxo-hsl and 3-hydroxy-hsl causes different conformational changes in the ahl receptors curr1 and curr2 as a result , there is a different dna-binding motif affinity and thereby different target genes are activated on the other hand , this switch modifies its ability to colonize the epithelial cell surfaces of hydra vulgaris recent studies have discovered that anaerobiosis can significantly impact the major regulatory circuit of quorum sensing also show quorum sensing activity it produces ahls and also , it can degrade the ahl molecules as well have been isolated from various infected sites from patients ( bile , blood , peritoneal fluid , pus , stool and urine ) all isolates produced the two principal ahls , n-butanoylhomoserine lactone ( c4-hsl ) and n-hexanoyl homoserine lactone ( c6-hsl ) in 2002 , the crystal structure of the receptor luxp of vibrio harveyi with its inducer ai-2 ( which is one of the few biomolecules containing boron ) bound to it was also determined a database of quorum-sensing peptides is available under the name quorumpeps researchers have developed novel molecules which block the signalling receptors of bacteria ( '' quorum quenching '' ) mbtl is a compound that has been shown to inhibit quorum sensing and decrease the amount of cell death by a significant amount overall , the quorum sensing genes seem to have diverged along with the proteobacteria phylum as a whole a recent acquisition by horizontal gene transfer would be unlikely to have integrated itself to this degree further research into this inter-kingdom communication also enhances the possibility of learning about quorum sensing in humans it was found that the genome of this strain encoded an inactivation enzyme with distinct motifs targeting the degradation of ahls this technique has also been translated to agriculture , to restrict the spread of pathogenic bacteria that use quorum sensing in plants social insect colonies are an excellent example of a decentralized system , because no individual is in charge of directing or making decisions for the colony quorum sensing can also be used to coordinate the behavior of autonomous robot swarms dedicated issue of philosophical transactions b on quorum sensing ( 2007 )
