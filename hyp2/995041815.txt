sanborn 's report for the chicago tribune about addie joss 's performance against the white sox calls it '' an absolutely perfect game , without run , without hit , and without letting an opponent reach first base by hook or crook , on hit , walk , or error , in nine innings '' this source also includes an 1880 clipping from the new york herald describing lee richmond 's perfect game for worcester writeups for the ward perfect game of 1880 and the young game of 1904 describe the games as '' wonderful '' and other effusive terms , but do not use the term '' perfect game '' several sources have claimed that the first recorded usage of the term perfect game was by ernest lanigan in his baseball cyclopedia , made in reference to charlie robertson 's 1922 perfect game the baseball cyclopedia reference came in a supplement to the 1922 edition of the book ( a publication of baseball magazine ) and was worded thus : '' charles robertson of chicago americans pitched an absolutely perfect no-hit game against detroit on april 30 , 1922 , no one reaching first '' the publication listed all the perfect games to that point ( a total of five , including robertson 's ) and used the term '' perfect game '' matter-of-factly , possibly indicating the term was already familiar to the readership '' lanigan was also familiar with sanborn 's baseball articles , making various references to him elsewhere in the cyclopedia , although there is nothing indicating that sanborn necessarily inspired lanigan 's use of the term similarly , in writing up john montgomery ward 's 1880 perfect game , the new york clipper described the '' perfect play '' of providence 's defense as of 2014 , the current major league baseball definition of a perfect game is largely a side effect of the decision made by the major leagues ' committee for statistical accuracy on september 4 , 1991 , to redefine a no-hitter as a game in which the pitcher or pitchers on one team throw a complete game of nine innings or more without surrendering a hit the definition of perfect game was made to parallel this new definition of the no-hitter , in effect substituting '' baserunner '' for '' hit '' as a result of the 1991 redefinition , for instance , harvey haddix receives credit for neither a perfect game nor a no-hitter for his performance on may 26 , 1959 , when he threw 12 perfect innings against the milwaukee braves before allowing a baserunner in the 13th by coincidence , the second yankee pitcher to throw a perfect game , david wells in 1998 , graduated from the same high school as larsen - point loma high school in san diego , california in a further coincidence , larsen was in attendance when the third yankee pitcher to throw a perfect game , david cone in 1999 , performed the feat on the same day that larsen and yogi berra ( the catcher in the 1956 perfect game ) were invited to do the ceremonial first pitch ron hassey is the only catcher in mlb history to have caught more than one perfect game ( his first was with pitcher len barker in 1981 and his second was with pitcher dennis martínez in 1991 ) the most recent perfect game pitched in major league baseball was thrown by félix hernández of the seattle mariners against the tampa bay rays on august 15 , 2012 the perfect game : a classic collection of facts , figures , stories and characters from the society for american baseball research ( taylor ) base ball on the western reserve : the early game in cleveland and northeast ohio , year by year and town by town , 1865–1900 ( jefferson , n.c '' one out away from fame : the final out of hitless games has often proved to be a pitcher 's toughest conquest '' , baseball digest ( june ; available online )
