the first debate in crowd psychology began in rome at the first international congress of criminal anthropology on 16 november 1885 the meeting was dominated by cesare lombroso and his fellow italians , who emphasized the biological determinates '' a weak response was offered by the french , who put forward an environmental theory of human psychology anguilli called attention to the importance of the influence of the social environment upon crime '' the psychology of crowd dynamics '' , blackwell handbook of social psychology : group processes in paris during 10–17 august 1889 , the italian school received a stronger rebuke of their biological theories during the 2nd international congress of criminal anthropology a radical divergence in the views between the italian and the french schools was reflected in the proceedings : '' professor lombroso laid stress upon epilepsy in connection with his theory of the 'born criminal ' professor léonce pierre manouvrier characterized lombroso 's theory as nothing but the exploded science of phrenology the anomalies observed by lombroso were met with in honest men as well as criminals , manouvrier claimed , and there is no physical difference between them it is in this context that you have a debate between scipio sighele , an italian lawyer and gabriel tarde , a french magistrate on how to determine criminal responsibility in the crowd and hence who to arrest crowds , psychology and politics 1871–1899 there is limited research into the types of crowd and crowd membership and there is no consensus as to the classification of types of crowds two recent scholars , momboisse ( 1967 ) and berlonghi ( 1995 ) focused upon purpose of existence to differentiate among crowds another approach to classifying crowds is sociologist herbert blumer 's system of emotional intensity that is , a crowd changes its level of emotional intensity over time , and therefore , can be classed in any one of the four types generally , researchers in crowd psychology have focused on the negative aspects of crowds , but not all crowds are volatile or negative in nature for example , in the beginning of the socialist movement crowds were asked to put on their sunday dress and march silently down the street an expressive mob is any other large group of people gathering for an active purpose le bon held that crowds existed in three stages : submergence , contagion , and suggestion during submergence , the individuals in the crowd lose their sense of individual self and personal responsibility in le bon 's view , this effect is capable of spreading between '' submerged '' individuals much like a disease crowd members become susceptible to any passing idea or emotion le bon believed that crowds could be a powerful force only for destruction clark mcphail points out studies which show that '' the madding crowd '' does not take on a life of its own , apart from the thoughts and intentions of members additionally , le bon 's theory ignores the socio-cultural context of the crowd , which some theorists argue can disempower social change if one is deindividuated as a kkk member , aggression increases , but if it is as a nurse , aggression does not increase ) '' convergence theory holds that crowds form from people of similar dispositions , whose actions are then reinforced and intensified by the crowd however , if the crowd is primarily related to some identifiable group ( such as christians or hindus or muslims or civil-rights activists ) , then the values of that group will dictate the crowd 's action in crowds which are more ambiguous , individuals will assume a new social identity as a member of the crowd p van de sande , on crowds ( dutch and english ) '' crowd disasters '' by prof
