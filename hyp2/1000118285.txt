the attention to mindset within the study of cognitive psychology has continued relatively unabated a characteristic of this area of study , in all its various manifestations , is the fragment use of mindset throughout the academy ( e.g a well-known example is the '' cold war mindset '' prevalent in both the u.s and ussr , which included absolute trust in two-player game theory , in the integrity of command chain , in control of nuclear materials , and in the mutual assured destruction of both in the case of war although most consider that this mindset usefully served to prevent an attack by either country , the assumptions underlying deterrence theory have made assessments of the efficacy of the cold war mindset a matter of some controversy most theorists consider that the key responsibility of an embedded power group is to challenge the assumptions that comprise the group 's own mindset may have made that country more able to challenge assumptions than the kremlin with its more static bureaucracy modern military theory attempts to challenge entrenched mindsets in dealing with asymmetric warfare , terrorism , and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in combination , these threats represent '' a revolution in military affairs '' and require very rapid adaptation to new threats and circumstances there is a double relation between the institution embodying for example an entrepreneurial mindset and its entrepreneurial performance zara notes that since collective reflection is more explicit , discursive , and conversational , it therefore needs a good ¿gestell ? —especially when it comes to information and communication technology as previously alluded to , there is a great deal of variation within the study of mindsets nevertheless , any discussion of mindset should include recognition concerning the numerous , varied , and growing number of mindsets and mindset theories that receive attention in multiple disciplines throughout the academy the mindscape theory and cultural values outlined by sagive and schwarts combine to make a more comprehensive whole of mindset agency theory hierarchical bureaucrats generally view the world as having natural order with competition and consequences much like natural selection social reformers view the world as a balance that can be maintained by symbiosis between everything sagiv and schwarts posited three bi-polar dimensions to culture based on values these dimensions contain opposites in the realms of cognitive , figurative , and operative values : cognitive : embeddedness or autonomy figurative : mastery or harmony operative : hierarchy or egalitarian according to carol dweck , individuals can be placed on a continuum according to their implicit views of '' where ability comes from '' dweck states that there are two categories ( growth mindset versus fixed mindset ) that can group individuals based on their behaviour , specifically their reaction to failure people with a '' fixed mindset '' believe that abilities are mostly innate and interpret failure as the lack of necessary basic abilities , while those with a '' growth mindset '' believe that they can acquire any given ability provided they invest effort or study in particular , an individual 's mindset impacts how they face and cope with challenges , such as the transition into junior high school from elementary school or losing your job according to dweck , individuals with a '' growth '' mindset are more likely to continue working hard despite setbacks dweck argues that the growth mindset '' will allow a person to live a less stressful and more successful life '' in a 2012 interview , dweck defined both fixed and growth mindsets : an example of a person with a growth mindset is an employee who , when posed with an extraordinarily challenging assignment , takes the project as a growing opportunity instead of one that will defeat them a large part of dweck 's research on mindsets has been done in the field of education , and how these mindsets affect a student 's performance in the classroom in order for students to effectively adopt a growth mindset , a classroom culture needs to be established that nurtures this type of thinking according to dweck 2010 , '' the teacher should portray challenges as fun and exciting , while portraying easy tasks as boring and less useful for the brain '' a second strategy to promote a growth-mindset culture in the classroom is to explicitly teach lessons related to what it means to adopt a growth mindset it was found that the use of journaling could positively affect a student 's learning process by improving their conceptual knowledge , promoting growth mindset , and enhancing understanding of their thoughts through writing the way educators evaluate their students ' work and communicate their progress can also contribute to the establishment of a growth mindset culture in the classroom in 2015 , ashley buchanan proposed a complementary evolution to the fixed and growth mindset called the benefit mindset the defensive mindset may lead to learning based on false assumptions or prevent learning altogether ( argyris , 2004 ) ( 2007 ) knowledge entrepreneurship in universities : practice and strategy in the case of internet based innovation appropriation surowiecki , j
