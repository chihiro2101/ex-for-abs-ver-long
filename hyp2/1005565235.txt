a typical high-purity grade of lanolin is composed predominantly of long chain waxy esters ( approximately 97 % by weight ) with the remainder being lanolin alcohols , lanolin acids and lanolin hydrocarbons an estimated 8,000 to 20,000 different types of lanolin esters are present in lanolin , resulting from combinations between the 200 or so different lanolin acids and the 100 or so different lanolin alcohols identified so far lanolin derivatives obtained from these processes are used widely in both high-value cosmetics and dermatology products hydrolysis of lanolin yields lanolin alcohols and lanolin acids notably , approximately 40 % of the acids derived from lanolin are alpha-hydroxy acids ( ahas ) 40 & nbsp ; mg/kg ) total pesticides was stipulated for lanolin of general use , with no individual limit greater than 10 & nbsp ; ppm lanolin conforming to this monograph is intended for use in more exacting applications , for example on open wounds these ultra-high-purity grades of lanolin are ideally suited to the treatment of dermatological disorders such as eczema and on open wounds a study carried out at new york university hospital in the early 1950s had shown about 1 % of patients with dermatological disorders were allergic to the lanolin being used at that time the european cosmetics directive , introduced in july 1976 , contained a stipulation that cosmetics which contained lanolin should be labelled to that effect despite only being in force for a short period of time , this ruling did harm both to the lanolin industry and to the reputation of lanolin in general in another study , a high purity grade of lanolin was found to be significantly superior to petrolatum in assisting the healing of superficial wounds lanocote ) containing up to 85 % lanolin are used to prevent corrosion in marine fasteners , especially when two different metals are in contact with each other and saltwater
