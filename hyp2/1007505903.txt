fischer black ( 1972 ) developed another version of capm , called black capm or zero-beta capm , that does not assume the existence of a riskless asset \right where p_t is the payoff of the asset or portfolio the rate at which future cash flows produced by the asset should be discounted given that asset 's relative riskiness thus , a more risky stock will have a higher beta and will be discounted at a higher rate ; less sensitive stocks will have lower betas and be discounted at a lower rate given the accepted concave utility function , the capm is consistent with intuition—investors ( should ) require a higher return for holding a more risky asset since beta reflects asset-specific sensitivity to non-diversifiable , i.e stock market indices are frequently used as local proxies for the market—and in that case ( by definition ) have a beta of one an investor in a large , diversified portfolio ( such as a mutual fund ) , therefore , expects performance in line with the market unsystematic risk can be diversified away to smaller levels by including a greater number of assets in the portfolio ( specific risks '' average out '' ) therefore , the required return on an asset , that is , the return that compensates for risk taken , must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context—i.e in the capm context , portfolio risk is represented by higher variance i.e in other words , the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor the capm assumes that the risk-return profile of a portfolio can be optimized—an optimal portfolio displays the lowest possible level of risk for its level of return all investors : aim to maximize economic utilities ( asset quantities are given and fixed ) deal with securities that are all highly divisible into small parcels ( all assets are perfectly divisible and liquid ) a critique of the traditional capm is that the risk measure used remains constant ( non-varying beta ) ) in practice , such a market portfolio is unobservable and people usually substitute a stock index as a proxy for the true market portfolio the capital asset pricing model : some empirical tests , pp the capital asset pricing model ( capm ) , short-sale restrictions and related issues , journal of finance , 32 ( 177 ) stone , bernell k ( 1970 ) risk , return , and equilibrium : a general single-period theory of asset selection and capital-market equilibrium a final version was published in 1999 , in asset pricing and portfolio performance : models , strategy and performance metrics
