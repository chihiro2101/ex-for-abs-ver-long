radio clocks synchronized to a terrestrial time signal can usually achieve an accuracy within a hundredth of a second relative to the time standard , generally limited by uncertainties and variability in radio propagation list of radio time signal stations bipm annual report on time activities â€“ ftp : //ftp2.bipm.org/pub/tai/scale/timesignals/timesignals.pdf time signals , retrieved 2018 july 31 a number of manufacturers and retailers sell radio clocks that receive coded time signals from a radio station , which , in turn , derives the time from a true atomic clock their model gc-1000 '' most accurate clock '' received shortwave time signals from radio station wwv in fort collins , colorado depending upon signal strength they may require placement in a location with a relatively unobstructed path to the transmitter and need fair to good atmospheric conditions to successfully update the time inexpensive clocks keep track of the time between updates , or in their absence , with a non-disciplined quartz-crystal clock , with the accuracy typical of non-radio-controlled quartz timepieces many modern tv sets and vcrs with ttx decoders can obtain accurate time from teletext and set the internal clock 100506 digitalspy.co.uk many digital radio and digital television schemes also include provisions for time-code transmission ; vhf fm radio data system : rds can send a clock signal with sub-second precision but with an accuracy no greater than 100 ms and with no indication of clock stratum a radio clock receiver may combine multiple time sources to improve its accuracy these gps clocks combine time estimates from multiple satellite atomic clocks with error estimates maintained by a network of ground stations gps clocks provide the precise time needed for synchrophasor measurement of voltage and current on the commercial power grid to determine the health of the system casio wave ceptor clock network speaking clock time from npl time transfer time synchronization in north america
