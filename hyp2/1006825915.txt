the concept of reconfigurable computing has existed since the 1960s , when gerald estrin 's paper proposed the concept of a computer made of a standard processor and an array of '' reconfigurable '' hardware the main processor would control the behavior of the reconfigurable hardware the latter would then be tailored to perform a specific task , such as image processing or pattern matching , as quickly as a dedicated piece of hardware this resulted in a hybrid computer structure combining the flexibility of software with the speed of hardware in the 1980s and 1990s there was a renaissance in this area of research with many proposed reconfigurable architectures developed in industry and academia , c bobda : introduction to reconfigurable computing : architectures ; springer , 2007 such as : copacobana , matrix , garp , hauser , john r and wawrzynek , john , '' garp : a mips processor with a reconfigurable coprocessor '' , proceedings of the ieee symposium on field-programmable custom computing machines ( fccm '97 , april 16â€“18 , 1997 ) , pp some of these massively parallel reconfigurable computers were built primarily for special subdomains such as molecular evolution , neural or image processing the world 's first commercial reconfigurable computer , the algotronix chs2x4 , was completed in 1991 it was not a commercial success , but was promising enough that xilinx ( the inventor of the fpga , fpga ) bought the technology and hired the algotronix staff algotronix history later machines enabled first demonstrations of scientific principles , such as the spontaneous spatial self-organisation of genetic coding with meregen high-performance reconfigurable computing ( hprc ) is a computer architecture combining reconfigurable computing-based accelerators like field-programmable gate array with cpus or multi-core processors the us national science foundation has a center for high-performance reconfigurable computing ( chrec ) commercial high-performance reconfigurable computing systems are beginning to emerge with the announcement of ibm integrating fpgas with its power processor electronic hardware , like software , can be designed modularly , by creating subcomponents and then higher-level components to instantiate them in many cases it is useful to be able to swap out one or several of these subcomponents while the fpga is still operating while the partial data is sent into the fpga , the rest of the device is stopped ( in the shutdown mode ) and brought up after the configuration is completed fine grained systems by their own nature require greater configuration time than more coarse-grained architectures due to more elements needing to be addressed and programmed partial re-configuration allows smaller reconfigurable bit streams thus not wasting energy on transmitting redundant information in the bit stream some of the most intuitive designs use a peripheral bus to provide a coprocessor like arrangement for the reconfigurable array this can be relaxed by the concept of threads , allowing different tasks to run concurrently on this virtual hardware to exploit task level parallelism computing with memory glossary of reconfigurable computing iland project m-labs 1chipmsx piperench psoc sprinter
