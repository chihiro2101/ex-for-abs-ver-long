much of our current understanding of blindsight can be attributed to early experiments on monkeys one monkey named helen could be considered the '' star monkey in visual research '' because she was the original blindsight subject subjects who had suffered damage to their visual cortices due to accidents or strokes reported partial or total blindness in spite of this , when they were prompted they could '' guess '' with above-average accuracy about the presence and details of objects , much like the animal subjects , and they could even catch objects that were tossed at them furthermore , blindsight subjects rarely express the amazement about their abilities that sighted people would expect them to express this ability of those with blindsight to act as if able to see objects that they are unconscious of suggests that consciousness is not a general property of all parts of the brain , but is produced by specialised parts of it blindsight patients show awareness of single visual features , such as edges and motion , but can not gain a holistic visual percept therefore , object identification and object recognition are thought to be separate processes and occur in different areas of the brain , working independently from one another the modular theory of object perception and integration would account for the '' hidden perception '' experienced in blindsight patients another explanation for the phenomenon of blindsight is that even though the majority of a person 's visual cortex may be damaged , tiny islands of functioning tissue remain a third theory is that the information required to determine the distance to and velocity of an object in object space is determined by the lateral geniculate nucleus before the information is projected to the visual cortex in a 1995 experiment , researchers attempted to show that monkeys with lesions in or even wholly removed striate cortexes also experienced blindsight the monkeys were placed in front of a monitor and taught to indicate whether a stationary object or nothing was present in their visual field when a tone was played then the monkeys performed the same task except the stationary objects were presented outside of their visual field another 1995 study by the same group sought to prove that monkeys could also be conscious of movement in their deficit visual field despite not being consciously aware of the presence of an object there lawrence weiskrantz and colleagues showed in the early 1970s that if forced to guess about whether a stimulus is present in their blind field , some observers do better than chance this ability to detect stimuli that the observer is not conscious of can extend to discrimination of the type of stimulus ( for example , whether an ' x ' or ' o ' has been presented in the blind field ) however , more recent evidence point to a pathway from s-cones to the superior colliculus , opposing previous research and supporting the idea that some chromatic processing mechanisms are intact in blindsight patients shown images on their blind side of people expressing emotions correctly guessed the emotion most of the time if the stimulus was in the upper part of his visual field , he was to say it was in the lower part , and vice versa researchers applied the same type of tests that were used to study blindsight in animals to a patient referred to as db the results of db 's guesses showed that db was able to determine shape and detect movement at some unconscious level , despite not being visually aware of this previous studies had already demonstrated that even without conscious awareness of visual stimuli humans could still determine certain visual features such as presence in the visual field , shape , orientation and movement but , in a newer study evidence showed that if the damage to the visual cortex occurs in areas above the primary visual cortex the conscious awareness of visual stimuli itself is not damaged if an area of the cortex that is responsible for a certain function is damaged , it will only result in the loss of that particular function or aspect , functions that other parts of the visual cortex are responsible for remain intact prior studies have already shown that blindsight patients are able to detect motion even though they claim they do not see any visual percepts in their blind fields both of the subjects had displayed the ability to accurately determine the presence of visual stimuli in their blind hemifields without acknowledging an actual visual percept previously but , regardless of the dots ' color the subjects could not tell when they were in motion or not when the white background and the dots were of similar brightness kentridge , heywood , and weiskrantz used the phenomenon of blindsight to investigate the connection between visual attention and visual awareness to test the relationship between attention and awareness , they had the participant try to determine where a target was and whether it was oriented horizontally or vertically on a computer screen people with damage to v1 report no conscious vision , no visual imagery , and no visual images in their dreams however , some of these people still experience the blindsight phenomenon , though this too is controversial , with some studies showing a limited amount of consciousness without v1 or projections relating to it in a study conducted in primates , after partial ablation of area v1 , areas v2 and v3 were still excited by visual stimulus
