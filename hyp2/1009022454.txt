originally , klezmer referred to musical instruments , and was later extended to refer , as a pejorative , to musicians themselves from the 16th to 18th centuries , it replaced older terms such as leyts ( clown ) it was not until the late 20th century that the word came to identify a musical genre early 20th century recordings and writings most often refer to the style as '' yiddish '' music , although it is also sometimes called freilech music ( yiddish , literally '' happy music '' ) the first recordings to use the term '' klezmer '' to refer to the music were the klezmorim 's east side wedding and streets of gold in 1977/78 , followed by andy statman and zev feldman 's jewish klezmer music in 1979 klezmer is easily identifiable by its characteristic expressive melodies , reminiscent of the human voice , complete with laughing and weeping a number of dreydlekh ( a yiddish word for ornament ( music ) ) , such as krekhts ( '' sobs '' ) are used to produce this style various musical styles influenced traditional klezmer music klezmer musicians heard and adapted traditional romanian music , which is reflected in the dance forms found throughout surviving klezmer music repertoire ( e.g the bible has several descriptions of orchestras and levites making music , but after the destruction of the second temple in 70 ce , many rabbis discouraged musical instruments however , the importance of merrymaking at weddings was not diminished , and musicians came forth to fill that niche , klezmorim klezmorim based much of their secular instrumental music upon the devotional vocal music of the synagogue , in particular hazzan music klezmorim often travelled and played with romani musicians ( '' lăutari '' ) , because they occupied similar social strata they had a great influence on each other musically and linguistically ( the extensive klezmer argot in yiddish includes some romani borrowings ) klezmorim were respected for their musical abilities and diverse repertoire , but they were by no means restricted to playing klezmer they sometimes played for christian churches and local aristocracy , and taught some italian classical violin virtuosos hence musicians took up the violin , tsimbl ( or cymbalom ) , and other stringed instruments the first musician to play klezmer in european concerts , josef gusikov , played a type of xylophone which he invented and called a '' wood and straw instrument '' later , around 1855 under the reign of alexander ii of russia , ukraine permitted loud instruments george gershwin was familiar with klezmer music , and the opening clarinet glissando of rhapsody in blue suggests this influence , although the composer did not compose klezmer directly at the same time , non-jewish composers were also turning to klezmer for a prolific source of fascinating thematic material in 1985 , henry sapoznik and adrienne cooper founded klezkamp to teach klezmer and other yiddish music bands like brave old world , hot pstromi and the klezmatics also emerged during this period interest in klezmer has been sustained and supported by such well-known avant-garde jazz musicians as john zorn and don byron , who sometimes blend klezmer with jazz klezmer melodies have recently been incorporated into songs by third-wave ska band streetlight manifesto today the band has developed a new sound of modern klezmer , pushing the perimeter of klezmer to incorporate many cultures and touring worldwide they wanted to explore klezmer and lăutari roots , and fuse the music of the two '' other european '' groups in order to preserve and promote klezmer music in israel , burstein founded the jerusalem klezmer association , which has become a center for learning and performance of klezmer music in the country according to walter zev feldman , the klezmer dance repertoire seems to have been relatively uniform across the areas of jewish settlement in the russian empire however , there were several times in history where this transmission broke down , including mass emigration , but especially the holocaust , which destroyed most of jewish life and culture in europe few scions of klezmer dynasties remained in europe , one notable exception being leopold kozlowski of poland a few older klezmorim—such as leon schwartz , dave tarras , and german goldenshtayn—survived into the klezmer revival era and could recall some forgotten repertoire in the 21st century , klezmer is typically learned from '' fake books '' and transcriptions of old recordings , although the music was traditionally transmitted and learned by ear
