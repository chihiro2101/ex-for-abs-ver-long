atmospheric or wind-borne fugitive dust , also known as aeolian dust , comes from arid and dry regions where high velocity winds are able to remove mostly silt-sized material , deflating susceptible surfaces saharan dust in particular can be transported and deposited as far as the caribbean and the amazon basin , and may affect air temperatures , cause ocean cooling , and alter rainfall amounts dust kicked up by vehicles traveling on roads may make up 33 % of air pollution road dust consists of deposits of exhaust gas , particles from tire and brake dust , dust from paved roads or potholes , and dust from construction sites control of road dust is a significant challenge in urban areas , and also in other locations with high levels of vehicular traffic upon unsealed roads , such as mines and landfill dumps coal dust is responsible for the lung disease known as pneumoconiosis , including black lung disease that occurs among coal miners in addition , if enough coal dust is dispersed within the air in a given area , in very rare circumstances , it can create an explosion hazard under certain circumstances most governmental epas , including the united states environmental protection agency ( epa ) mandate that facilities that generate fugitive dust , minimize or mitigate the production of dust in their operation reducing vehicle maintenance costs by lowering the levels of dust that clog filters , bearings and machinery us federal laws require dust control on sources such as vacant lots , unpaved parking lots , and unpaved roads pre weighted filter and matched weight filters made from polyvinyl chloride or mixed cellulose ester are suitable for respirable dust ( less than 10 micrometers in diameter ) a dust resistant surface is a state of prevention against dust contamination or damage , by a design or treatment of materials and items in manufacturing or through a repair process dust also covers solid planetary bodies , and vast dust storms can occur on mars which cover almost the entire planet dust in this regime has a complicated emission spectrum , and includes both thermal dust emission and spinning dust emission image : dust over southeast australia.jpg dry , windy weather sends clouds of dust across south-eastern australia
