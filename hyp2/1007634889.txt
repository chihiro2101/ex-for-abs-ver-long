the purpose of any engine bell is to direct the exhaust of a rocket engine in one direction , generating thrust in the opposite direction ambient air pressure also imparts a small pressure against the exhaust , helping to keep it moving in the '' right '' direction as it exits the engine as the vehicle travels upwards through the atmosphere , ambient air pressure is reduced , outward from the main exhaust plume ) , the efficiency of the engine is reduced as the rocket travels because this escaping exhaust is no longer contributing to the thrust of the engine an aerospike rocket engine seeks to eliminate this loss of efficiency the idea behind the aerospike design is that at low altitude the ambient pressure compresses the exhaust against the spike exhaust recirculation in the base zone of the spike can raise the pressure in that zone to nearly ambient this effectively behaves like an '' altitude compensator '' in that the size of the bell automatically compensates as air pressure falls aerospikes work relatively poorly between mach 1â€“3 , where the airflow around the vehicle has reduced the pressure , thus reducing the thrust this work on aerospike engines continues ; prospector-10 , a ten-chamber aerospike engine , was test-fired june 25 , 2008 the plug-cluster aerospike engine puts out of thrust a new company , firefly aerospace , has replaced the aerospike engine with a conventional engine in the alpha 2.0 design they later announced that their executor aerospike engine would produce of thrust at sea level and of thrust in a vacuum in september 2017 , arca announced that , after being delayed , their linear aerospike engine was ready to perform ground tests and flight tests on a demonstrator3 rocket
