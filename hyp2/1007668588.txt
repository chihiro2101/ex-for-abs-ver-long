the aire and calder is a canalisation of the river calder from wakefield to castleford , where it joins the branch from leeds , which follows the river aire the section below haddlesey is no longer part of the navigation , as a derelict lock blocks access to the lower river instead , the selby canal flows northwards from haddlesey to the ouse at selby below dole bank junction , the knottingley and goole canal flows eastwards to join the ouse at goole more recent canals now also make the navigation a vital link in the english and welsh connected inland waterway network beyond leeds , the leeds and liverpool canal carries boats over the pennines the calder and hebble navigation , which connects to the navigation at wakefield , allows boats to reach the huddersfield broad and narrow canals , and the rochdale canal the selby canal connects to the ouse , from where boats can travel upstream to reach york , boroughbridge and ripon , or downstream to the river derwent in the early 1600s , the river aire was navigable to knottingley , and boats carrying up to 30 & nbsp ; tons traded on the river , which was tidal up to this point as the 1600s drew to a close , a number of bills were passed for other rivers , and there was general support for river navigations a bill was drawn up in 1698 , with support from wool traders in leeds and general merchants in wakefield john hadley surveyed the aire , and samuel shelton surveyed the calder although the bill had a lot of support , it was opposed by the city of york , who feared that the river ouse would be damaged by the scheme john hadley was engaged as the engineer immediately , and by 1704 the original work was completed , including 12 locks on the aire between haddesley and leeds and 4 on the calder the locks were long by wide with depths over the sills there was a long-running dispute with arthur ingram , who owned knottingley mill , which started in 1731 , and was not finally resolved until 1776 , when the company bought both of ingram 's mills despite this , the general profitability of the navigation led the undertakers to be complacent about its development with parliament not reaching a decision , they reworked their plan , which was now for a canal from haddlesey to selby , with a new cut from ferrybridge to beal , and improvements above castleford those opposing the scheme were placated by a clause which ensured the aire to airmyn and the selby canal would be maintained in july 1821 , rennie proposed the construction of docks at goole , rather than a lock into the river , and the company proposed that of water should be available construction at goole started on 28 september 1822 , and the company eventually built much of the new town as well as the docks the scheme had cost £361,484 , of which £221,350 had been borrowed , while the rest came from company resources in 1861 , bartholomew met with the chairman , warde-aldam , to propose a system of sectional boats , each consisting of six compartments , with a bow and stern section in 1905 , the new junction canal connected the aire and calder to the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation near stainforth although coal mining was one of the main reasons for the success of the navigation , it has also brought problems , caused by subsidence a 20th-century modification of the compartment boat system was used to feed the coal-fired ferrybridge '' c '' power station beyond castleford , boaters can travel on to selby , york , goole , sheffield , and keadby
