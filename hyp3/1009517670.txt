the genus lynx is now accepted , and the bobcat is listed as lynx rufus in modern taxonomic sources the genus lynx shares a clade with the genetic lineages puma , prionailurus and felis dated to ; lynx diverged approximately this population evolved into modern bobcats around 20,000 years ago a second population arrived from asia and settled in the north , developing into the modern canada lynx 13 bobcat subspecies have been historically recognized based on morphological characteristics : l rufus ( schreber ) – eastern and midwestern united states l gigas ( bangs ) – northern new york to nova scotia and new brunswick l superiorensis ( peterson & downing ) – western great lakes area , including upper michigan , wisconsin , southern ontario , and most of minnesota l baileyi ( merriam ) – southwestern united states and northwestern mexico l californicus ( mearns ) – california west of the sierra nevada l mohavensis ( b.anderson ) – mojave desert of california l allen ) – central mexico , with a northern extension along the west coast to southern sonora l fasciatus ( rafinesque ) – oregon , washington west of the cascade range , northwestern california , and southwestern british columbia l pallescens ( merriam ) – northwestern united states and southern british columbia , alberta , and saskatchewan l the bobcat resembles other species of the midsize genus lynx , but is on average the smallest of the four its coat is variable , though generally tan to grayish-brown , with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail a few melanism bobcats have been sighted and captured in florida , usa and new brunswick , canada the nose of the bobcat is pinkish-red , and it has a base color of gray or yellowish- or brownish-red on its face , sides , and back bobcat swims across lake lanier adult males can range in weight from , with an average of ; females at , with an average of ) , animal : the definitive visual guide to the world 's wildlife furthermore , a june 20 , 2012 report of a new hampshire roadkill specimen listed the animal 's weight at status survey and conservation action plan each night , it moves from along its habitual route this behavior may vary seasonally , as bobcats become more diurnal during fall and winter in response to the activity of their prey , which are more active during the day in colder weather bobcat activities are confined to well-defined territories , which vary in size depending on the sex and the distribution of prey the home range is marked with feces , urine scent , and by clawing prominent trees in the area '' patterns in bobcat ( lynx rufus ) scent marking and communication behaviors the sizes of bobcats ' home ranges vary significantly ; a world conservation union ( iucn ) summary of research suggests ranges from transient bobcats were found to have both larger ( roughly and less well-defined home ranges kittens had the smallest range at about one study found a large variation in male range sizes , from in summer up to in winter other research in various american states has shown little or no seasonal variation unusual for cats , males are more tolerant of overlap , while females rarely wander into others ' ranges given their smaller range sizes , two or more females may reside within a male 's home range one study noted a dense , unhunted population in california had a sex ratio of 2.1 males per female the bobcat is able to survive for long periods without food , but eats heavily when prey is abundant when these prey species exist together , as in new england , they are the primary food sources of the bobcat birds up to the size of an adult trumpeter swan are also taken in ambushes , along with their fledglings and eggs the bobcat is an opportunistic predator that , unlike the more specialized canada lynx , readily varies its prey selection the bobcat hunts animals of different sizes , and adjusts its hunting techniques accordingly survival and cause-specific mortality of gray foxes ( urocyon cinereoargenteus ) in southern california however , some amount of bobcat predation may be misidentified , as bobcats have been known to scavenge on the remains of livestock kills by other animals it stalks the deer , often when the deer is lying down , then rushes in and grabs it by the neck before biting the throat , base of the skull , or chest with the canada lynx , however , the interspecific competition affects distribution patterns ; competitive exclusion by the bobcat is likely to have prevented any further southward expansion of the range of its felid relative like other lynx species , bobcats probably avoid encounters with bears , in part because they are likely to lose kills to them or may rarely be attacked by them american alligators ( alligator mississippensis ) have been filmed opportunistically preying on adult bobcats in the southeast united states in the 1970s and 1980s , an unprecedented rise in price for bobcat fur caused further interest in hunting , but by the early 1990s , prices had dropped significantly for bobcats , preserving open space in sufficient quantities and quality is necessary for population viability
