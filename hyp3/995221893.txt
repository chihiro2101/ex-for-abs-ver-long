atmel was an acronym for “ advanced technology for memory and logic ” perlegos had worked in the memory group of intel in the 1970s and had co-founded seeq technology to manufacture eprom memory using only us 30,000 in capital , atmel was initially operated as a fabless company , using sanyo and general instrument to make the chip wafers fundinguniverse.com , '' atmel corporation history '' the first atmel memory products used less power than competitors about.com , '' atmel corporation '' rather than fight the patent claim , atmel redesigned its products to use different intellectual property atmel used us 60 million in venture capital for the 1989 purchase of a fabrication facility from honeywell in colorado springs atmel then invested another us 30 million in manufacturing technology the first atmel flash memory microcontroller was based on the intel 8051 in 1994 , atmel purchased the eerom assets of seeq technology ( lsi corporation acquired the rest of seeq in 1999 ) in 1995 , atmel acquired the pan-european chipmaker european silicon structures ( es2 ) and thus gained a fabrication facility in rousset , france atmel formed a design team in trondheim , norway to develop the atmel avr line of risc microcontrollers this team combined technology of former students at the norwegian university of science and technology with atmel 's expertise in flash memory this started in 2005 when atmel sold the mhs fab in nantes france to xbybus atmel completed the sale of their secure microcontroller solutions smart card business to inside secure in february 2011 , atmel sold its digital research in electronics , acoustics and music ( dream ) business , which sold products for karaoke and other entertainment machines , for us 2.3 million as atmel divested several fabs and ancillary business lines , laub also oversaw acquisitions '' atmel 's xsense technology will make curved touchscreens possible ( hands-on ) '' atmel moved into internet of things technology in 2012 , atmel had approximately us 1.4 billion in annual revenue , with over 60 % of their revenue from microcontrollers , and net income of us 30 million in october 2008 , atmel received an unsolicited offer from microchip technology and on semiconductor , estimated at us 2.3 billion supporting the microcontrollers is the atmel studio 7 integrated development environment which atmel offers for free atmel also makes simple touch controller chips for buttons , sliders , and wheels used on industrial and consumer products atmel 's cryptorf products add hardware encrypted security to rfid applications
