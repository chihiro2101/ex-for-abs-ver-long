the attention to mindset within the study of cognitive psychology has continued relatively unabated in addition to the field of cognitive psychology , the use of mindset is evident within the social sciences and several other fields ( e.g a characteristic of this area of study , in all its various manifestations , is the fragment use of mindset throughout the academy ( e.g and ussr , which included absolute trust in two-player game theory , in the integrity of command chain , in control of nuclear materials , and in the mutual assured destruction of both in the case of war although most consider that this mindset usefully served to prevent an attack by either country , the assumptions underlying deterrence theory have made assessments of the efficacy of the cold war mindset a matter of some controversy most theorists consider that the key responsibility of an embedded power group is to challenge the assumptions that comprise the group 's own mindset according to these commentators , power groups that fail to review or revise their mindsets with sufficient regularity can not hold power indefinitely , as a single mindset is unlikely to possess the flexibility and adaptability needed to address all future events for example , the variations in mindset between democratic party and republican party presidents in the u.s modern military theory attempts to challenge entrenched mindsets in dealing with asymmetric warfare , terrorism , and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction firstly , an institution with an entrepreneurial philosophy will set entrepreneurial goals and strategies as a whole , but maybe even more importantly , it will foster an entrepreneurial milieu , allowing each entity to pursue emergent opportunities collective mindsets in this sense are described in such works as hutchin 's '' cognition in the wild '' ( 1995 ) , who analyzes a whole team of naval navigators as the cognitive unit or as computational system , or senges ' knowledge entrepreneurship in universities ( 2007 ) nevertheless , any discussion of mindset should include recognition concerning the numerous , varied , and growing number of mindsets and mindset theories that receive attention in multiple disciplines throughout the academy each contain differing views toward information , perception , logic , and ethics hierarchical bureaucrats generally view the world as having natural order with competition and consequences much like natural selection sagiv and schwarts posited three bi-polar dimensions to culture based on values dweck states that there are two categories ( growth mindset versus fixed mindset ) that can group individuals based on their behaviour , specifically their reaction to failure people with a '' fixed mindset '' believe that abilities are mostly innate and interpret failure as the lack of necessary basic abilities , while those with a '' growth mindset '' believe that they can acquire any given ability provided they invest effort or study dweck argues that the growth mindset '' will allow a person to live a less stressful and more successful life '' as such , it is important for educators to carefully craft and design meaningful learning activities for their students to engage in the classroom according to dweck 2010 , '' the teacher should portray challenges as fun and exciting , while portraying easy tasks as boring and less useful for the brain '' a second strategy to promote a growth-mindset culture in the classroom is to explicitly teach lessons related to what it means to adopt a growth mindset possible activities include establishing personal goals , writing letters , or having students share with one another something they used to be poor at and now are very good at it was found that the use of journaling could positively affect a student 's learning process by improving their conceptual knowledge , promoting growth mindset , and enhancing understanding of their thoughts through writing the way educators evaluate their students ' work and communicate their progress can also contribute to the establishment of a growth mindset culture in the classroom overall , it is clear to see that a classroom that includes challenging learning tasks , praising of the process , and explicit growth mindset teaching and assessment , is a classroom where students will have the tools needed to become lifelong learners while elements of our personality – such as sensitivity to mistakes and setbacks – can make us predisposed towards holding a certain mindset , we are able to develop and reshape our mindset through our interactions in multiple studies , dweck and her colleagues noted that alterations in mindset could be achieved through '' praising the process through which success was achieved '' , cimpian , a '' in a recent study by patrick & joshi ( 2019 ) , the way teachers explain growth and fixed mindsets was explored secondly , it was found that many teachers tended to oversimplify the concepts of a growth and fixed mindset into positive and negative traits this suggests the need for more teacher training and support in order for teachers to be able to successfully implement growth mindset initiatives in their classrooms a study conducted by seaton ( 2018 ) , looked specifically at the impact of teacher training aimed at influencing their mindsets and the effect on their resulting practice the growth mindset intervention halted the students ' decline in grades and started the students on a new pathway of improvement and high achievement '' ( boaler , 2013 ) in recent years , there has been criticism leveraged at '' growth mindset '' as a concept , and the related research that has been carried out in 2015 , ashley buchanan proposed a complementary evolution to the fixed and growth mindset called the benefit mindset
