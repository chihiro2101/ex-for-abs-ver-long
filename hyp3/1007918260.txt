the play begins with praxagora emerging from a house on an athenian street before daybreak the chorus of athenian women enter one by one , all dressed in similar costume the women are wary of the plan and praxagora attempts to rally them as they practice speaking as men before the assembly praxagora is frustrated by the women 's inability to pretend to be men , as they swear to demeter and persephone rather than apollo , address the assembled women as ladies , and complain about the discomfort of their disguises and their thirst she proposes that the men turn control of the government over to the women because '' after all , we employ them as stewards and treasurers in our own households '' she further explains that women are superior to men because they are harder workers , devoted to tradition and do not bother with useless innovations praxagora impresses the women with her rhetorical skills , and explains that it was learned from listening to orators while living with her husband on the pnyx , where the athenian assembly was held as he squats in the street lamenting his constipation , his neighbor arrives and both men realize that their wives and clothing are missing from their homes chremes , returning from the assembly , comes upon blepyrus and his neighbor and explains that he was not paid because of the unprecedented turn-out of pale faced shoe-makers ( referring to the women in disguise ) now free of attending the assembly , the men are pleased to finally sleep in , but are not excited about having to provide sex to receive their breakfast praxagora then goes on to explain the details of the new government to blepyrus in the next scene , blepyrus â€™ neighbor is laying his household objects out in front of his house to be contributed to the common fund as the selfish man enters the ascent of women in political power in assemblywomen is yet another commentary on what aristophanes saw as the shameful effeminacy of the men currently in power in athens the fact that women in this instance could enter the assembly and successfully pass as men was a commentary on politicians being indistinguishable from women in costume
