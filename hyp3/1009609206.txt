writers of the decadent movement used the slogan '' art for art 's sake '' ( l'art pour l'art ) , the origin of which is debated some claim that it was invented by the philosopher victor cousin , although angela leighton in the publication on form : poetry , aestheticism and the legacy of a word ( 2007 ) notes that the phrase was used by benjamin constant as early as 1804 it is generally accepted to have been promoted by théophile gautier in france , who interpreted the phrase to suggest that there was not any real association between art and morality as a consequence , they did not accept john ruskin , matthew arnold , and george macdonald 's conception of art as something moral or useful , '' art for truth 's sake '' there are a few significant continuities between the pre-raphaelite philosophy and that of the aesthetes : dedication to the idea of ‘ art for art ’ s sake ’ ; admiration of , and constant striving for , beauty ; escapism through visual and literary arts ; craftsmanship that is both careful and self-conscious ; mutual interest in merging the arts of various media this final idea is promoted in the poem l ’ art by théophile gautier , who compared the poet to the sculptor and painter however , their approach to aestheticism did not share the creed of ‘ art for art ’ s sake ’ but rather “ a spirited reassertion of those principles of colour , beauty , love , and cleanness that the drab , agitated , discouraging world of the mid-nineteenth century needed so much ” this reassertion of beauty in a drab world also connects to pre-raphaelite escapism in art and poetry although the work of edward burne-jones was exhibited at the grosvenor gallery which promoted the movement , it is narrative and conveys moral or sentimental messages hence falling outside the movement 's purported programme the maxim '' art for art 's sake , '' identifying art or beauty as the primary element in other branches of the aesthetic movement , especially fine art , can not apply in this context that is , decorative art must first have utility , but may also be beautiful however , according to michael shindler , the decorative art branch of the aesthetic movement , was less the utilitarian cousin of aestheticism 's main 'pure ' branch , and more the very means by which aesthetes exercised their fundamental design strategy aesthetic style furniture is characterized by several common themes : ebonized wood with gilt highlights as aesthetic movement decor was similar to the corresponding writing style in that it was about sensuality and nature , nature themes often appear on the furniture since the aesthetic movement was only prevalent in the decorative arts from about 1880 until about 1890 , there are not many surviving examples of this particular style but one such example is 18 stafford terrace , london , which provides an insight into how the middle classes interpreted its principles '' 'reform and eastern art ' in decorative arts society journal '' 2010 victoria and albert museum '' a higher ambition : owen jones ( 1809–74 )
