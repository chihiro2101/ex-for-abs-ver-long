text of the oath the oath was included in article 17 of the irish free state 's 1922 constitution it read : the words '' allegiance to the constitution of the irish free state '' were taken from de valera 's preferred version , which read : '' i ( name ) do solemnly swear true faith and allegiance to the constitution of the irish free state , to the treaty of association , and to recognise the king of great britain as head of associated states ironically , in view of the opposition expressed to the oath by anti-treatyites , it was in fact largely the work of michael collins , based in its open lines on a draft oath suggested by the president of dáil éireann , éamon de valera , and also on the oath of the irish republican brotherhood in their view : the oath was an acceptance of a common citizenship between ireland and britain under king george and therefore was in total contravention to the oath to the irish republic which they had previously taken dáil éireann – volume 3–19 december 1921 debate on treaty they rebutted the argument that it was simply an oath to the constitution by pointing out that the constitution itself made the king head of state and it was therefore the same as an oath of allegiance to him directly in contrast to this pro-treaty campaigners declared that : the oath of allegiance was actually '' true faith and allegiance to the constitution of the irish free state '' ( a line drafted by de valera in his own proposed oath ) the fidelity to the king was not to him as british monarch but '' in virtue of the common citizenship of ireland with great britain and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the british commonwealth of nations '' , in other words , in his role as the symbol of the treaty settlement , not as british king while the republican oath was much mentioned in the treaty debates of 1921–22 , it had taken over a year to arrange to have the oath sworn by the dáil tds and ira volunteers , between may 1919 and august 1920 cosgrave to introduce a law requiring all dáil candidates to pledge that they would take the oath , otherwise they could not contest the election following the 1782 relief act , which gave catholic schools a legal footing , teachers were required to take an oath of allegiance to the british crown
