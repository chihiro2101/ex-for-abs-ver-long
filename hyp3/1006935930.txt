chromosomes were first observed in plant cells by carl wilhelm von nägeli in 1842 their behavior in animal ( salamander ) cells was described by walther flemming , the discoverer of mitosis , in 1882 the name was coined by another german anatomist , heinrich von waldeyer in 1888 in 1922 seems to have been the first person to define the karyotype as the phenotypic appearance of the somatic chromosomes , in contrast to their gene contents comparative karyological study of species muscari mill painter in 1922 was not certain whether the diploid of humans was 46 or 48 , at first favoring 46 , but revised his opinion from 46 to 48 , and he correctly insisted on humans having an xx/xy system the karyotype of humans includes only 46 chromosomes chromosomes alec macandrew ; accessed 18 may 2006 the study of karyotypes is made possible by staining for humans , white blood cells are used most frequently because they are easily induced to divide and grow in tissue culture the association of cytogenetic technologists , raven press , new york six different characteristics of karyotypes are usually observed and compared : differences in absolute sizes of chromosomes for example , the legumes lotus tenuis and vicia faba each have six pairs of chromosomes , yet v faba chromosomes are many times larger these differences probably reflect different amounts of dna duplication differences in number and position of satellites euchromatin is usually under active transcription and stains much lighter as it has less affinity for the giemsa stain thompson & thompson genetics in medicine 7th ed euchromatin regions contain larger amounts of guanine-cytosine pairs the most common karyotypes for females contain two x chromosomes and are denoted 46 , xx ; males usually have both an x and a y chromosome denoted 46 , xy some variations in karyotype , whether to autosomes or allosomes , cause chromosome abnormalities there is variation between species in chromosome number , and in detailed organization , despite their construction from the same chromatin in some species , as in many sciaridae , entire chromosomes are eliminated during development this process is a carefully organised genome rearrangement where new telomeres are constructed and certain heterochromatin regions are lost the diploid number of the chinese muntjac , muntiacus reevesi , was found to be 46 , all telocentric when they looked at the karyotype of the closely related indian muntjac , muntiacus muntjak , they were astonished to find it had female 6 , male 7 chromosomes the number of chromosomes in the karyotype between ( relatively ) unrelated species is hugely variable the high record would be somewhere amongst the ferns , with the adder 's tongue fern ophioglossum ahead with an average of 1262 chromosomes top score for animals might be the shortnose sturgeon acipenser brevirostrum at 372 chromosomes the fundamental number , fn , of a karyotype is the number of visible major chromosomal arms per set of chromosomes thus , fn ≤ 2 x 2n , the difference depending on the number of chromosomes considered single-armed ( acrocentric or telocentric ) present humans have fn 82 , due to the presence of five acrocentric chromosome pairs : 13 , 14 , 15 , 21 , and 22 ( the human y chromosome is also acrocentric ) the fundamental autosomal number or autosomal fundamental number , fna or an , of a karyotype is the number of visible major chromosomal arms per set of autosomes ( non-allosome ) polyploidy , where there are more than two sets of homologous chromosomes in the cells , occurs mainly in plants polyploid series in related species which consist entirely of multiples of a single basic number are known as euploid endopolyploidy occurs when in adult differentiated tissues the cells have ceased to divide by mitosis , but the nuclei contain more than the original somatic number of chromosomes in the endocycle ( endomitosis or endoreduplication ) chromosomes in a 'resting ' nucleus undergo reduplication , the daughter chromosomes separating from each other inside an intact nuclear membrane aneuploidy is the condition in which the chromosome number in the cells is not the typical number for the species abnormalities in chromosome number usually cause a defect in development there is some evidence from the case of the mollusc thais lapillus ( the dog whelk ) on the brittany coast , that the two chromosome morphs are adapted to different habitats the dark regions are euchromatic ( guanine-cytosine rich regions ) and the bright regions are heterochromatic ( thymine-adenine rich regions ) thus , chromosomes or chromosome sections can be visualized and identified , allowing for the analysis of chromosomal rearrangements 1p36 deletion syndrome , from the loss of part of the short arm of chromosome 1
