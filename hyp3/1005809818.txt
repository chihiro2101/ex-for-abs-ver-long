when performing block-based discrete cosine transform ( dct ) coding for quantization , as in jpeg-compressed images , several types of artifacts can appear at low bit rates , any lossy block-based coding scheme introduces visible artifacts in pixel blocks and at block boundaries these boundaries can transform block boundaries , prediction block boundaries , or both , and may coincide with macroblock boundaries the term macroblocking is commonly used regardless of the artifact 's cause the transform ( for example the discrete cosine transform ) is applied to a block of pixels , and to achieve lossy compression , the transform coefficients of each block are quantized many photo editing programs , for instance , have proprietary jpeg artifact reduction algorithms built-in boundary artifact in jpeg can be turned into more pleasing '' grains '' not unlike those in high iso photographic films motion compensation block boundary artifacts in motion compensated video compression , the current picture is predicted by shifting blocks ( macroblocks , partitions , or prediction units ) of pixels from previously decoded frames p.930 ( 08/96 ) principles of a reference impairment system for video the so-called '' mosquito noise '' is caused by the block-based discrete cosine transform ( dct ) compression algorithm used in most video coding standards , such as the mpeg formats lossy audio formats typically involve the use of a time/frequency domain transform , such as a modified discrete cosine transform when the psychoacoustic model is inaccurate , when the transform block size is restrained , or when aggressive compression is used , this may result in compression artifacts compression artifacts may intentionally be used as a visual style , sometimes known as glitch art
