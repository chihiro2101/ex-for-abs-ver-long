1903 : charlie taylor built an inline engine , mostly of aluminum , for the wright flyer ( 12 horsepower ) 1903 : manly-balzer engine sets standards for later radial engines 1906 : léon levavasseur produces a successful water-cooled v8 engine for aircraft use 1908 : louis seguin designed the gnome omega , the world 's first rotary engine to be produced in quantity in 1909 a gnome powered farman iii aircraft won the prize for the greatest non-stop distance flown at the reims grande semaine d'aviation setting a world record for endurance of the aircraft never flew , but a patent was filed for routing exhaust gases into the duct to augment thrust june 1939 : heinkel he 176 is the first successful aircraft to fly powered solely by a liquid-fueled rocket engine 1945 : first turboprop-powered aircraft flies , a modified gloster meteor with two rolls-royce trent engines 1948 : 100 shp 782 , the first turboshaft engine to be applied to aircraft use ; in 1950 used to develop the larger turbomeca artouste in this entry , for clarity , the term '' inline engine '' refers only to engines with a single row of cylinders , as used in automotive language , but inline engine ( aeronautics ) ( as described below ) , and is not limited to engines with a single row of cylinders the greatest advantage of an inline engine is that it allows the aircraft to be designed with a low frontal area to minimize drag the disadvantages of an inline engine include a poor power-to-weight ratio , because the crankcase and crankshaft are long and thus heavy inline engines were common in early aircraft ; one was used in the wright flyer , the aircraft that made the first controlled powered flight for other configurations of aviation inline engine , such as x engine , u engine , h engine , etc perhaps the most famous example of this design is the legendary rolls-royce merlin engine , a 27-litre ( 1649 in 3 ) 60° v12 engine used in , among others , the spitfires that played a major role in the battle of britain a horizontally opposed engine , also called a flat or boxer engine , has two banks of cylinders on opposite sides of a centrally located crankcase opposed engines are mounted with the crankshaft horizontal in airplanes , but may be mounted with the crankshaft vertical in helicopters in addition , the compact cylinder arrangement reduces the engine 's frontal area and allows a streamlined installation that minimizes aerodynamic drag opposed , air-cooled four- and six-cylinder piston engines are by far the most common engines used in small general aviation aircraft requiring up to per engine aircraft that require more than per engine tend to be powered by gas turbine each row generally has an odd number of cylinders to produce smooth operation a radial engine has only one crankshaft per row and a relatively small crankcase , resulting in a favorable power-to-weight ratio the lower cylinders , which are under the crankcase , may collect oil when the engine has been stopped for an extended period if this oil is not cleared from the cylinders prior to starting the engine , serious damage due to hydrolock may occur the best known engine of this type is the anzani engine , which was fitted to the bleriot xi used for the first flight across the english channel in 1909 this arrangement had the drawback of needing a heavy counterbalance for the crankshaft , but was used to avoid the spark plugs oiling up however , the large frontal area also resulted in an aircraft with an aerodynamic increased frontal area engine designers had always been aware of the many limitations of the rotary engine so when the static style engines became more reliable and gave better specific weights and fuel consumption , the days of the rotary engine were numbered in an aircraft application , the power-to-weight ratio is very important , making the wankel engine a good choice considerable development of these designs started after world war ii , but at the time the aircraft industry favored the use of turbine engines it was believed that turbojet or turboprop engines could power all aircraft , from the largest to smallest designs in modern times the wankel engine has been used in motor gliders where the compactness , light weight , and smoothness are crucially important the now-defunct staverton-based firm midwest designed and produced single- and twin-rotor aero engines , the midwest ae series often the turbines that drive the propeller are separate from the rest of the rotating components so that they can rotate at their own best speed ( referred to as a free-turbine engine ) reaction engines generate the thrust to propel an aircraft by ejecting the exhaust gases at high velocity from the engine , the resultant reaction of forces driving the aircraft forwards a turbofan engine is much the same as a turbojet , but with an enlarged fan at the front that provides thrust in much the same way as a ducted propeller , resulting in improved fuel efficiency although engine weight increases by 30 % , fuel economy in aircraft is reduced by 15 % aircraft diesel engine aviation safety engine configuration federal aviation regulations hyper engine list of aircraft engines model engine united states military aircraft engine designations
