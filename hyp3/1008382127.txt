the party was founded on 7 april 1947 as the arab ba'ath party by michel aflaq ( an antiochian christian ) , salah al-din al-bitar ( a sunni muslim ) , and the followers of zaki al-arsuzi ( an atheist ) in damascus , syria , leading to the establishment of the syrian regional branch other regional branches were established throughout the arab world in the later 1940s and early 1950s , in , among others , iraq , yemen and jordan the 2nd national congress was convened in june 1954 , and elected a seven-man national command ; aflaq , bitar , and akram al-hawrani were elected and represented the syrian regional branch , while abdullah rimawi and abdallah na'was were elected to represent the jordanian branch the congress is notable for sanctioning the merger of the arab socialist movement and the ba'ath party , which took place in 1952 the syrian regional branch rose to prominence in the 1940s and 1950s ; in the 1954 parliamentary elections the syrian regional branch won 22 seats in parliament , becoming the second largest party in the country 90 percent of ba'ath party members who stood for elections were elected to parliament the failure of the traditional parties represented by the people 's party and the national party , strengthened the ba'ath party 's public credibility through this position , the party was able to get two of its members into the cabinet ; bitar was appointed minister of foreign affairs and khalil kallas became minister of economics its new , strengthened position , was used successfully to garner support for syria 's merger with gamal abdel nasser 's egypt , which led to the establishment of the united arab republic ( uar ) in 1958 on 24 june 1959 , fuad al-rikabi , the regional secretary of the iraqi regional branch , accused the national command of betraying arab nationalist principles by conspiring against the uar the congress is notable for endorsing the dissolution of the syrian regional branch , which had been decided by aflaq and bitar without inner-party consultation in 1958 , and for expelling rimawi , the regional secretary of the jordanian regional branch rimawi reacted to his expulsion by forming his own party , the arab socialist revolutionary ba'ath party , which established a rival national command to compete with the original the national command responded to the problems in iraq by appointing a temporary regional command on 2 february 1960 , which appointed talib el-shibib as regional secretary , and on 15 june 1961 the national command expelled rikabi from the party in iraq , the iraqi regional branch had supported abd al-karim qasim 's seizure of power and its ensuing abolishment of the iraqi monarchy however , this was proven to be a ruse , and after taking power qasim launched an iraq first policy in retaliation , the ba'ath party tried to assassinate qasim in february 1959 , but the operation ( which was led by a young saddam hussein ) failed declassified documents and the testimony of former cia officers indicate there was no direct american involvement , although the cia had been previously notified of an earlier ba'athist coup plot in july 1962 by a high-ranking informant within the party on a separate plan to instigate a military coup against qasim , and who later became the head of the cia 's operations in iraq and syria '' from late 1968 to june 1970 , '' has '' denied any involvement in the ba'ath party 's actions the 4th national congress , held in august 1960 , criticized the leadership of aflaq and bitar , called for the reestablishment of the syrian regional branch and deemphasized the party 's commitment to arab nationalism while emphasizing more the socialist character of the party he was supported in his ideological reorientation by hammud al-shufi , the regional secretary of the syrian regional branch , yasin al-hafiz , one of the party ’ s few ideological theorists , and by certain members of the secret military committee aflaq , angry at this transformation of his party , retained a nominal leadership role , but the national command as a whole came under the control of the radicals in 1963 the ba'ath party seized power , from then on the ba'ath functioned as the only officially recognized syrian political party , but factionalism and splintering within the party led to a succession of governments and new constitutions on 23 february 1966 , a coup d'état led by salah jadid , the informal head of the military committee , overthrew aflaq and the bitar 's cabinet while it took some years , the 1966 coup resulted in the creation of two competing national commands , one syrian-dominated and another iraqi-dominated the organizational structure of the ba'ath party was created at the 2nd national congress by amending the party 's internal regulations , which was approved at the party 's 1st national congress in 1947 the national command was the ruling organ of the party between sessions of the national congress , and was headed by a secretary-general the national consultative council was a forum made up of representatives from the party 's regional branches the national congress elected the national command , national tribunal , the party 's discipline body , and the secretary-general , the party leader the regional congress is made of delegates from the provincial branches ; other members attended , but as observers the regional congress was responsible for evaluating the party 's performance since the last regional congress , while at the same time formulating new policies for the next period , which lasts until the next regional congress is held the regional command , similar to the branch command , operated through bureaus and met for weekly-sessions a section , which comprised two to five divisions , functioned at the level of a large city quarter , a town , or a rural district a division comprised two to seven circles , controlled by a division commander an active member had to attend all formal meetings of his party unit , was given the right to vote in party elections , and could run for party office the pan-arab tendencies of the party 's predecessor , the arab ba'ath movement , was strengthened 1945–1947 by recruiting members from the zaki al-arsuzi 's arab ba'ath according to middle east expert tabitha petran , the basic idea of the party 's ideology was ; that the arab nation is a permanent entity in history it was not islam that modeled the peoples of arabia , the fertile crescent , and north africa , equipping them with islamic values , especially the arabic language and the arabic culture , but the arab nation which created islam '' while peasants and issues facing them are mentioned in some of aflaq 's work , there was scarcely any depth given to them or the issues facing them issues such as these would only gain prominence when akram al-hawrani became a leading party figure , and when the '' transitional ba'athists '' took power the early party organization never cultivated a deep following in rural areas the '' transitional ba'ath '' , which grew out of the dissolution of the syrian regional branch in 1958 dissolution and the military committee , were more rural in outlook , policy and ideology the slogan '' unity , liberty , socialism '' is the key tenet in ba'athist thought the last tenet , 'socialism ' , did not mean socialism as it is defined in the west , but rather a unique form of arab socialism the original interpretation of arab socialism did not answer questions such as : how much state control was necessary , or economic equality ; but instead focused on freeing the arab nation and its people from colonization and oppression in general however , being the unionist party that it was , the party 's leaders could not state their position on this issue the end result was that the pro-arab nationalists within the ba'ath party became committed nasserists , while the more moderate arab nationalists founded the pro-nasserite socialist unionists party the provincial party members had not been told of the syrian regional branch 's dissolution , which in fact broke the communication line with provincial branches and the national command hammud al-shufi became the leader of the party 's marxist faction during his short stint as syrian regional secretary , literally the head of the syrian regional organization the 6th national congress signified the takeover of the party by an anti-militarist left , which opposed both the traditional leaders in the national command and the pragmatists in the military committee there are those who trace the branch 's founding to abd ar rahman ad damin and abd al khaliq al khudayri in 1947 , after their return from the 1st national congress , which was held in syria it elected a regional command and appointed rimawi as the branch 's regional secretary however , a persistent problem for him during his election campaign was the vocal criticism of him and the regional branch by the lebanese communist party at the 6th national congress , the lebanese regional branch elected jubrän majdalani and khalid al-ali to the national command aside from the syrian communist party ( scp ) , the ba'ath party was the only party able to organise mass protests among workers the ba'ath party had only 2,500 members by mid-1963 , the party lacked a popular base
