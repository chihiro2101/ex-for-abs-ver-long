the word tsetse means '' fly '' in tswana , a bantu language of southern africa recently , tsetse without the fly has become more common in english , particularly in the scientific and development communities tsetse flies can be seen as independent individuals in three forms : as third-instar larvae , pupae and as adults within the puparial shell , tsetse complete the last two larval instars and the pupal stage other forms of human trypanosomiasis also exist but are not transmitted by tsetse the most notable is american trypanosomiasis , known as chagas disease , which occurs in south america , caused by trypanosoma cruzi , and transmitted by certain insects of the reduviidae , members of the hemiptera animal trypanosomiasis , also called nagana when it occurs in cattle or horses or sura when it occurs in domestic pigs , is caused by several trypanosome species these diseases reduce the growth rate , milk productivity , and strength of farm animals , generally leading to the eventual death of the infected animals trypanosoma congolense and trypanosoma vivax are the two most important species infecting bovine cattle in sub-saharan africa other forms of animal trypanosomiasis are also known from other areas of the globe , caused by different species of trypanosomes and transmitted without the intervention of the tsetse fly the tsetse fly vector ranges mostly in the central part of africa trypanosomiasis poses a considerable constraint on livestock agricultural development in tsetse fly infested areas of sub saharan africa , especially in west and central africa economic guidelines for strategic planning of tsetse and trypanosomiasis control in west africa , by a.p.m the disease can be managed by controlling the vector and thus reducing the incidence of the disease by disrupting the transmission cycle economic analysis indicates that the cost of managing trypanosomosis through the elimination of important populations of major tsetse vectors will be covered several times by the benefits of tsetse-free status area-wide interventions against the tsetse and trypanosomosis problem appear more efficient and profitable if sufficiently large areas , with high numbers of cattle , can be covered vector control strategies can aim at either continuous pest control of target populations while the fly eventually re-invaded in the 1950s , the new population of tsetse was free from the disease later , more targeted techniques used pour-on formulations in which advanced organic pesticides were applied directly to the backs of cattle right tsetse populations can be monitored and effectively controlled using simple , inexpensive traps tsetse are also attracted to large dark colors like the hides of cow and buffaloes in the literature of environmental determinism , the tsetse has been linked to difficulties during early state formation for areas where the fly is prevalent a '' tsetse suitability index '' was developed from insect population growth , climate and geospatial data to simulate the fly 's population steady state an increase in the tsetse suitability index was associated with a statistically significant weakening of the agriculture , levels of urbanization , institutions and subsistence strategies one conventional argument is that the tsetse fly made it difficult to use draught animals
