direct broadcast satellite dishes use an lnbf , which integrates the feedhorn with the lnb a new form of omnidirectional satellite antenna , which does not use a directed parabolic dish and can be used on a mobile platform such as a vehicle was announced by the university of waterloo in 2004 a typical value for a consumer type 60 & nbsp ; cm satellite dish at 11.75 & nbsp ; ghz is 37.50 & nbsp ; db the large size of dish required for lower frequencies led to the dishes being constructed from metal mesh on a metal framework at higher frequencies , mesh type designs are rarer though some designs have used a solid dish with perforations prior to the existence of direct broadcast satellite services , home users would generally have a motorised c-band dish of up to 3 m in diameter for reception of channels from different satellites in europe , the frequencies used by dbs services are 10.7–12.75 & nbsp ; ghz on two polarisations h ( horizontal ) and v ( vertical ) in the lnb they become down converted to 950–2150 & nbsp ; mhz , which is the frequency range allocated for the satellite service on the coaxial cable between lnbf and receiver in addition , control signals are also transmitted from the receiver to the lnb through the cable thumb a satellite finder ( or sat finder ) is a satellite field strength meter used to accurately point satellite dishes at communications satellites in geostationary orbit professional satellite finder meters allow better dish alignment and provide received signal parameter values as well with diseqc and usals , the satellite dish will automatically aim itself at one of sixteen satellites programmed in previously when pressing one of the channel buttons on the remote back of satellite dish.jpg the back side of an old c-band satellite dish showing the pole , mount , motor , and structure of the dish the first satellite television dishes were built to receive signals on the c-band analog , and were very large this was the first widely used direct-broadcast satellite television system and allowed dishes as small as 20 & nbsp ; inches to be used this great decrease of dish size also allowed satellite dishes to be installed on vehicles
