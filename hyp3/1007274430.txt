locally , this included a line from staveley to gainsborough , via worksop , with a branch to lincoln and another from worksop to beighton the previous year , the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway had been proposed , to build a line from sheffield to gainsborough , and was supported by the sheffield , ashton-under-lyne & manchester railway the new company amalgamated with the chesterfield canal , to become the rather unwieldy manchester & lincoln union railway & chesterfield & gainsborough canal , with powers to further amalgamate with the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway the act of parliament stated that although the canal company was to be dissolved , the entire canal was to be retained , its water supplies maintained , and tolls were to be fixed at a just level the railway company started to operate as a carrier on the canal , and to maintain water levels , the reservoirs at chesterfield were enlarged in 1856 however , the owners considered options for converting the canal from kiverton park to chesterfield into a railway in 1872 , 1873 and 1884 , but on each occasion , the plans were shelved the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway was expanding , and an act of parliament was obtained in 1889 , which allowed them to divert parts of the canal to enable a new railway connecting chesterfield , staveley and beighton to be constructed the new route was straighter than the old , and reduced the length of the canal by around the beighton to staveley section of the new railway opened on 1 december 1891 , and reached chesterfield on 4 june 1892 the original route of the canal at hague lane was largely destroyed by the construction of the railway and renishaw central station , but further north , the section around chapel wheel forge and dam is still clearly visible , and reinstatement of it as part of a restored canal was considered but rejected on practical grounds close to bluebank lock , the railway , known as the great central railway chesterfield loop , turned to the east and passed to the south of staveley iron works to reach staveley town station the canal was re-routed along the southern edge of the works , and the railway crossed over at staveley works station , almost on top of a new lock which was known as staveley works lock or hollingwood lock some 40 boats were still working on the canal , although a short section between staveley and chesterfield had become unnavigable responsibility for the canal passed the london and north eastern railway ( lner ) in 1923 , who carried out regular maintenance , and repaired and enlarged the lock connecting west stockwith basin to the river trent between 1923 and 1925 various attempts to reduce the growth of weed , which had first appeared on the canal in 1852 , were made , with variable success , and there was a brisk trade in munitions during the second world war parts of the isolated section from the tunnel to chesterfield were infilled and redeveloped clarke formed the retford and worksop ( chesterfield canal ) boat club soon afterwards , and it became a limited company in 1966 , to cope with the growing membership the chesterfield canal trust was formed in september 1976 , determined to restore the canal beyond worksop , and in 1977 they organised a boat rally at worksop to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the canal , in conjunction with the worksop and retford boat club the duke of devonshire opened the festivities , and the chesterfield canal society was formally launched , with a view to attracting support from anyone interested in the canal , rather than just from boaters thumb restoration had focussed initially on the route east from norwood tunnel to worksop , which presented relatively few physical obstacles to being restored to navigation however , in practice progress had been slow , and attention turned to the section west of norwood tunnel , where much more damage had been done to the canal bed , with it being filled in and built over in many places the last few miles of the canal , from chesterfield to staveley , were in reasonable condition , although the towpath was overgrown and difficult to access , while much of the route was under threat from opencast coal mining and a planned bypass , which had first been proposed in 1927 regular workparties began the process of restoration in 1988 , organised by the chesterfield canal society , and supplemented by volunteers from the waterway recovery group periodically a breach in the canal in march 2007 , caused by the collapse of a culvert carrying the tinkersick brook under the canal , forced temporary closure of all but the top pound above tapton lock for about six weeks near the site of the former renishaw iron foundry , which closed in 1992 and was subsequently redeveloped for housing , a length of canal was reexcavated in 2007â€“08 the solution adopted to overcome this was the construction of a dropped pound , with a new staveley town lock ( 5a ) immediately to the north of staveley basin to lower the level of the canal , and railway lock ( 5b ) constructed just beyond the railway bridge the chesterfield canal partnership , an association of local and regional authorities , including the chesterfield canal trust and other interested parties , have produced detailed plans for all of the work required to reinstate the missing section the engineers arup considered options for this section in 2007 , proposing a route running largely on the surface , and crossing the site of the kiveton park colliery , which closed in 1994 norwood tunnel was a , and , brick-lined canal tunnel on the line of the chesterfield canal with its western portal in norwood , derbyshire and its eastern portal
