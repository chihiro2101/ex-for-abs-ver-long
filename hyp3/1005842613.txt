in 1717 , a flintlock musket for the french infantry was standardized this became the first standard flintlock musket to be issued to all french troops while it is more correctly called a french infantry musket or a french pattern musket , these muskets later became known as '' charleville muskets '' , after the armory in charleville-mézières , ardennes , france the standard french long gun was also produced at tulle , saint-étienne , maubeuge arsenal , and other sites some references only refer to model 1763 and later versions as charleville flintlock muskets , while other references refer to all models as the charleville the charleville musket 's design was refined several times during its service life later models of charleville muskets remained in service until 1840 , when percussion cap systems made the flintlock mechanism obsolete charleville muskets had a smoothbore barrel like all smoothbore muskets , the charleville flintlock musket was only accurate to about against a column of men , or forty to fifty yards ( 37 to 46 m ) against a single mansized target the charleville 's 0.69-inch ( 17.5 mm ) caliber barrel was slightly smaller than its main competitor , the 0.75-inch caliber brown bess produced by the british muskets played a dual role on the battlefield , being used as a ranged weapon at a distance , and also being used as a pike-type weapon in close hand-to-hand combat this made the charleville sturdier than the british brown bess musket , which used pins to hold the barrel in place the butt of the charleville 's stock was sometimes referred to as the '' patte de vache '' ( french for '' cow 's foot '' ) , as its shape was designed to be used as a club in hand-to-hand combat after numerous musket designs in the late 17th and early 18th century , the infantry musket was standardized in what would become the model 1717 this model standardized most of the design features that would be common to all subsequent models , such as a the model 1717 also standardized the smoothbore barrel and flintlock firing mechanism unlike later models , the model 1717 had a pinned barrel , similar in design of the british brown bess though usually considered to be a separate model , the model 1766 was often referred to as a '' light model 1763 '' musket , especially in revolutionary war invoices while the model 1777 was used in the american revolutionary war , it was generally only used by french army who served on american soil , such as those under the command of general rochambeau the russian model 1808 musket was based heavily on the design of the model 1777 charleville charleville muskets were also copied by belgium , austria and prussia as the augustin 1842 musket and potzdam musket in the 1830s and 1840s , many old charleville muskets ( mostly later models ) were converted from flintlocks to percussion locks
