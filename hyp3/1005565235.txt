a typical high-purity grade of lanolin is composed predominantly of long chain waxy esters ( approximately 97 % by weight ) with the remainder being lanolin alcohols , lanolin acids and lanolin hydrocarbons an estimated 8,000 to 20,000 different types of lanolin esters are present in lanolin , resulting from combinations between the 200 or so different lanolin acids and the 100 or so different lanolin alcohols identified so far lanolin derivatives obtained from these processes are used widely in both high-value cosmetics and dermatology products hydrolysis of lanolin yields lanolin alcohols and lanolin acids lanolin alcohols are a rich source of cholesterol ( an important skin lipid ) and are powerful water-in-oil emulsifiers ; they have been used extensively in skincare products for over 100 years notably , approximately 40 % of the acids derived from lanolin are alpha-hydroxy acids ( ahas ) 40 & nbsp ; mg/kg ) total pesticides was stipulated for lanolin of general use , with no individual limit greater than 10 & nbsp ; ppm a second monograph also introduced into the us pharmacopoeia xxii in 1992 was entitled 'modified lanolin ' lanolin conforming to this monograph is intended for use in more exacting applications , for example on open wounds thumb lanolin and its many derivatives are used extensively in both the personal care ( e.g lanolin is used commercially in many industrial products ranging from rustproof coatings to lubricants baseball players often use it to soften and break in their baseball gloves ( shaving cream with lanolin is popularly used for this ) crude lanolin constitutes about 5â€“25 % of the weight of freshly shorn wool
