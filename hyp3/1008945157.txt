before the introduction of digital printing technology , production of small numbers of publications had many limitations large print jobs were not a problem , but small numbers of printed pages were typically during the early 20th century produced using stencils and reproducing on a mimeograph or similar machine and to print on a teletypewriter , line printer or other computer printer , but the software and hardware to produce original good-quality printed colour text and graphics and to print small jobs fast and cheaply was unavailable print on demand with digital technology is a way to print items for a fixed cost per copy , regardless of the size of the order while the unit price of each physical copy is greater than with offset printing , the average cost is lower for very small print jobs , because setup costs are much greater for offset printing pod has other business benefits besides lesser costs ( for small jobs ) : technical set-up is usually quicker than for offset printing large inventories of a book or print material do not need to be kept in stock , reducing storage , handling costs , and inventory accounting costs many publishers use pod for other printing needs other than books such as galley proof , catalogs and review copies pod publishing gives authors editorial independence , speed to market , ability to revise content , and greater financial return per copy than royalties paid by conventional publishers many major publishers print on demand as a way to save money this maintains the availability of older works , the estimated future sales of which may not be great enough to justify a further conventional print job pod allows a publisher to use cheaper conventional printing to produce enough copies to satisfy a pessimistic forecast of the publication sales , and then rely on pod to make up the difference print on demand is also used to print and reprint '' niche '' books that may have a high retail price but limited sales opportunities , such as specialist academic works print on demand also allows books to be printed in a variety of formats greatest profits are usually generated from sales direct from a print-on-demand service 's website or by the author buying copies from the service at a discount , as the publisher , and then selling them personally because the per-unit cost is typically greater with pod than with a print job of thousands of copies , it is common for pod books to be more expensive than similar books made by conventional print jobs , especially if a book is produced exclusively with pod instead of using pod as a supplemental technology between print jobs
