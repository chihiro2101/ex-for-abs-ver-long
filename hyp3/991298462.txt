atmospheric or wind-borne fugitive dust , also known as aeolian dust , comes from arid and dry regions where high velocity winds are able to remove mostly silt-sized material , deflating susceptible surfaces this airborne dust is considered an aerosol and once in the atmosphere , it can produce strong local radiative forcing saharan dust in particular can be transported and deposited as far as the caribbean and the amazon basin , and may affect air temperatures , cause ocean cooling , and alter rainfall amounts in iran , the dust is already affecting more than 5 million people directly , and has emerged as a serious government issue in recent years dust kicked up by vehicles traveling on roads may make up 33 % of air pollution road dust consists of deposits of exhaust gas , particles from tire and brake dust , dust from paved roads or potholes , and dust from construction sites in addition , if enough coal dust is dispersed within the air in a given area , in very rare circumstances , it can create an explosion hazard under certain circumstances the most frequent dust control violations occur at new residential housing developments in urban areas dust in such places may be suppressed by mechanical methods , including paving or laying down gravel , or stabilizing the surface with water , vegetable oils or other dust abatement , or by using water misters to suppress dust that is already airborne dust poses a health threat to children , '' dust mites in the humid atmosphere of bangalore trigger around 60 % of asthma '' older people , and those with respiratory illnesses cosmic dust is widely present in space , where gas and dust clouds are the primary precursors for planetary systems dust also covers solid planetary bodies , and vast dust storms can occur on mars which cover almost the entire planet ambient radiation heats dust and re-emits radiation into the microwave band , which may distort the cosmic microwave background power spectrum dust in this regime has a complicated emission spectrum , and includes both thermal dust emission and spinning dust emission image : dust extends from saudi arabia to iran.jpg a thick dust plume over kuwait and the north-western tip of the persian gulf
