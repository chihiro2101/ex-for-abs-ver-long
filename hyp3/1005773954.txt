the investigation of the nucleus was done by three optical spectrometers , one microwave radio antenna and one radar : alice ( an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ) the ultraviolet spectroscopy searched for and quantified the noble gas content in the comet nucleus , from which the temperature during the comet creation could be estimated the instrument used 2.9 watts , with an improved version onboard new horizons alice was built and operated by the southwest research institute for nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory the camera system had a narrow-angle lens ( 700 & nbsp ; mm ) and a wide-angle lens ( 140 & nbsp ; mm ) , with a 2048×2048 pixel ccd chip development and construction of the instrument was led by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) the visible and ir spectrometer was able to make pictures of the nucleus in the ir and also search for ir spectra of molecules in the coma the radio antenna along with the rest of the instrument was built by nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory with international contributions by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) , among others the radar performed tomography of the nucleus by measuring electromagnetic wave propagation between the philae lander and the rosetta orbiter through the comet nucleus development was led by the laboratoire de planétologie de grenoble with contributions by the ruhr-universität boch and the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) rsi made use of the probe 's communication system for physical investigation of the nucleus and the inner coma of the comet the cosima team is led by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps , germany ) comets are thought to have delivered a vast quantity of water to earth , and they may have also seeded earth with organic molecules before succumbing to falling power levels , philae cosac instrument was able to detect organic molecules in the comet 's atmosphere most asymmetrical molecules are oriented in approximately equal numbers of left- and right-handed configurations ( chirality ) , and the primarily left-handed structure of essential amino acids used by living organisms is unique the mission has yielded a significant science return , collecting a wealth of data from the nucleus and its environment at various levels of cometary activity in turn , the philae lander 's cosac instrument detected organic molecules in the comet 's atmosphere as it descended to its surface one of the most outstanding discoveries of the mission was the detection of large amounts of free molecular oxygen gas surrounding the comet ; 2005 4 march – rosetta executed its first planned close swing-by ( gravity assist passage ) of earth together with observations by hubble space telescope it could be confirmed that p/2010 & nbsp ; a2 is not a comet , but an asteroid , and that the tail most likely consists of particles from an impact by a smaller asteroid as part of the european space agency 's media campaign in support of the rosetta mission , both the rosetta and philae spacecraft were given anthropomorphic personalities in an animated web series titled once upon a time the series depicts various stages in the rosetta mission , involving the personified rosetta and philae on '' a classic road trip story into the depths of our universe '' , complemented with various visual gags presented in an educational context canonically , rosetta and philae are depicted as siblings , with rosetta being the older sister , inspired by the spacecraft 's feminine name , of philae , her younger brother a livestream of the control centres was set up , as were multiple official and unofficial events around the world to follow philae landing on 67p file : chasing a comet - the rosetta mission.webm about rosetta mission ( 9 min , 1080p hd , english ) file : landing on a comet - the rosetta mission.webm about philae landing ( 10 min
