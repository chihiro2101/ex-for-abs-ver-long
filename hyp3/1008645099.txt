by 1403 only a handful of castles , including harlech , still stood against the rebels , but the castle was under-equipped and under-staffed to withstand a siege , the garrison having just three shields , eight helmets , six lances , ten pairs of gloves , and four guns harlech became his residence , family home and military headquarters for four years ; he held his second parliament in harlech in august 1405 in 1408 english forces under the command of the future henry v placed harlech and its commander , edmund mortimer , under siege , conducting a bombardment with cannon , probably destroying the south and east parts of the outer walls when this failed to take the castle , henry left john talbot in charge of the siege and moved on to deal with aberystwyth castle in 1460 , following the battle of northampton , queen margaret of anjou fled to the castle and between 1461â€“68 it was held by her lancastrian supporters , under the command of dafydd ap ieuan , against the yorkist edward iv the castle became a base for their operations across the region : there were planned operations in 1464 , sir richard tunstall mounted attacks from harlech in 1466 and jasper tudor landed there with french reinforcements in 1468 , before then raiding the town of denbigh harlech apparently had not been repaired following the 1468 siege , and had become completely dilapidated , with the exception of the gatehouse , which was used for the local assizes the castle has a concentric castle , with one line of defences enclosed by another , forming an inner and outer ward ; the outer wall was originally somewhat taller than today the main entrance to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse ; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge each floor has three large windows overlooking the inner ward ; the second floor has two additional grand windows on the sides of the gatehouse ; the gatehouse was fitted with fireplaces and would originally have had prominent chimneys
