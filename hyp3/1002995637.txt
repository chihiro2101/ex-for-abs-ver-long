however , the difference in frame rates between film ( generally 24 frames/s ) and television ( 30 or 25 frames/s , interlaced ) meant that simply playing a film into a television camera would result in flickering originally the kinescope was used to record the image from a television display to film , synchronized to the tv scan rate however , this still left film shot at cinema frame rates as a problem for ntsc , the difference in frame rates can be corrected by showing every fourth frame of film twice , although this does require the sound to be handled separately to avoid '' skipping '' effects a more advanced technique is to use '' 2:3 pulldown '' , discussed below , which turns every second frame of the film into three fields of video , which results in a slightly smoother display however , during the analogue broadcasting period , the 24 frame per second film was shown at a slightly faster 25 frames per second rate , to match the pal video signal this resulted in a fractionally higher audio soundtrack , and resulted in feature films having a slightly shorter duration , by being shown 1 frame per second faster every time the video ( tele ) part of the telecine samples the light electronically , the film ( cine ) part of the telecine must have a frame in perfect registration and ready to photograph in countries that use the pal or secam video standards , film destined for television is photographed at 25 frames per second for film at 24 frame/s , there are 24 frames of film for every 25 frames of pal video in order to accommodate this mismatch in frame rate , 24 frames of film have to be distributed over 50 pal fields this can be accomplished by inserting a pulldown field every 12 frames , thus effectively spreading 12 frames of film over 25 fields ( or '' 12.5 frames '' ) of pal video in the case of pal dvds using 2:2 pulldown , the difference between soft and hard telecine vanishes , and the two may be regarded as equal
