bohm was born in wilkes-barre , pennsylvania , to a hungarian jewish immigrant father , samuel bohm , - by the numbers – david bohm and a lithuanian jewish mother bohm attended pennsylvania state college ( now pennsylvania state university ) , graduating in 1939 , and then the california institute of technology , for one year he then transferred to the theoretical physics group directed by robert oppenheimer at the university of california , berkeley radiation laboratory , where he obtained his doctorate bohm lived in the same neighborhood as some of oppenheimer 's other graduate students ( giovanni rossi lomanitz , joseph weinberg , and max friedman ) and with them became increasingly involved in radical politics during world war ii , the manhattan project mobilized much of berkeley 's physics research in the effort to produce the first atomic bomb during the war , bohm remained at berkeley , where he taught physics and conducted research in plasma , the synchrotron and the synchrocyclotron & nbsp ; 64 ) , '' the scattering calculations ( of collisions of protons and deuterons ) that he had completed proved useful to the manhattan project and were immediately classified after the war , bohm became an assistant professor at princeton university he also worked closely with albert einstein at the nearby institute for advanced study bohm invoked his fifth amendment right to refuse to testify , and he refused to give evidence against his colleagues dodds russell olwell : physics and politics in cold war america : the two exiles of david bohm , working paper number 20 although einstein considered appointing him as his research assistant at the institute , oppenheimer ( who had served as the institute 's president since 1947 ) '' opposed the idea and bohm then left for brazil to assume a professorship of physics at the university of são paulo , at jayme tiomno 's invitation and on the recommendation of both einstein and oppenheimer during his early period , bohm made a number of significant contributions to physics , particularly quantum mechanics and relativity theory as a postgraduate at berkeley , he developed a theory of plasmas , discovering the electron phenomenon now known as bohm diffusion bohm : the characteristics of electrical discharges in magnetic fields , in : a his first book , quantum theory , published in 1951 , was well received by einstein , among others but bohm became dissatisfied with the orthodox interpretation of quantum theory he wrote about in that book de gosson , basil j hiley : some remarks on the evolution of bohm 's proposals for an alternative to quantum mechanics , 30 january 2010 bohm and his colleague basil hiley later stated that they had found their own choice of terms of an '' interpretation in terms of hidden variables '' to be too restrictive , especially since their variables , position , and momentum '' are not actually hidden '' david bohm , basil hiley : the undivided universe : an ontological interpretation of quantum theory , edition published in the taylor & francis e-library 2009 ( first edition routledge , 1993 ) , , p : science and exile : david bohm , the cold war , and a new interpretation of quantum mechanics , hsps , vol & nbsp ; 36 , part & nbsp ; 1 , pp & nbsp ; 1–34 , issn 0890-9997 , 2005 at the university of são paulo , bohm worked on the causal theory that became the subject of his publications in 1952 his work with vigier was the beginning of a long-standing cooperation between the two and louis de broglie , in particular , on connections to the hydrodynamics model proposed by madelung yet the causal theory met much resistance and skepticism , with many physicists holding the copenhagen interpretation to be the only viable approach to quantum mechanics from 1951 to 1953 , bohm and david pines published the articles in which they introduced the random phase approximation and proposed the plasmon . bohm and aharonov form of the epr paradox in that picture , the classical limit for quantum phenomena , in terms of a condition that the action function is not much greater than planck 's constant , indicates one such criterion hiley : process and the implicate order : their relevance to quantum theory and mind it was one of a series of seminars held by bohm at oak grove school , and it was published as thought as a system bohm suggested that if the '' dialogue groups '' were experienced on a sufficiently-wide scale , they could help overcome the isolation and fragmentation that bohm observed in society david peat , infinite potential : the life and times of david bohm , reading , massachusetts : addison wesley , 1997 , pp the unity of everything : a conversation with david bohm , with nish dubashia
