as a rule , mitochondrial diseases are worse when the defective mitochondria are present in the muscles , cerebrum , or nerves , because these cells use more energy than most other cells in the body mitochondrial disorders may be caused by mutations ( acquired or inherited ) , in mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) , or in nuclear genes that code for mitochondrial components they may also be the result of acquired mitochondrial dysfunction due to adverse effects of drugs , infections , or other environmental causes oxalate may enter cells where it is known to cause mitochondrial dysfunction mitochondrial disease may become clinically apparent once the number of affected mitochondria reaches a certain level ; this phenomenon is called '' threshold expression '' defects in enzymes that control mitochondrial dna replication ( all of which are encoded for by genes in the nuclear dna ) may also cause mitochondrial dna mutations most mitochondrial function and biogenesis is controlled by nuclear dna human mitochondrial dna encodes 13 proteins of the respiratory chain , while most of the estimated 1,500 proteins and components targeted to mitochondria are nuclear-encoded other studies have shown that the mechanism may involve the interruption of the mitochondrial signaling process in body cells ( intramyocellular lipids ) the energy output of full healthy mitochondrial function can be predicted exactly by a complicated theoretical argument , but this argument is not straightforward , as most energy is consumed by the brain and is not easily measurable the most common tests for the detection of these diseases are : southern blot to detect big deletions or duplications polymerase chain reaction and specific mutation testing sequencing mitochondrial replacement therapy ( mrt ) , where the nuclear dna is transferred to another healthy egg cell leaving the defective mitochondrial dna behind , is an ivf treatment procedure the mitochondrial and metabolic disease center because mitochondrial disorders contain many variations and subsets , some particular mitochondrial disorders are very rare
