every color-managed device requires a personalized table , or '' color profile , '' which characterizes the color response of that particular device each color profile describes these colors relative to a standardized set of reference colors ( the '' profile connection space '' ) color-managed software then uses these standardized profiles to translate color from one device to another this is usually performed by a color management module ( cmm ) to describe the behavior of various output devices , they must be compared ( measured ) in relation to a standard color space this allows the embedding of color profiles into images as well as storing them in a database or a profile directory color transformation , or color space conversion , is the transformation of the representation of a color from one color space to another transforming profiled color information to different output devices is achieved by referencing the profile data into a standard color space it makes it easier to convert colors from one device to a selected standard color space and from that to the colors of another device by ensuring that the reference color space covers the many possible colors that humans can see , this concept allows one to exchange colors between many different color output devices color transformations can be represented by two profiles ( source profile and target profile ) or by a devicelink profile the color management system can utilize various methods to achieve desired results and give experienced users control of the gamut mapping behavior since 1997 color management in windows is available through an icc color management system ( icm ) vista 's new color management system : wcs gamma correction color chart digital printing icc profile international color consortium it8 linux color management
