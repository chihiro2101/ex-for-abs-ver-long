there are several theories about how and when gender identity forms , and studying the subject is difficult because children 's lack of language requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence john money suggested children might have awareness of and attach some significance to gender as early as 18 months to 2 years ; lawrence kohlberg argued that gender identity does not form until age 3 it is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age 3 after age three , core gender identity is extremely difficult to change , j ( a ) introduction ; ( b ) development of the ego capacity to differentiate , in the archives of sexual behavior , 1971 : '' though gender identity formation continues into young adulthood and core gender identity establishment extends into the fourth year and possibly longer , core gender identity is fairly firmly formed by age 3 coleman , developmental stages of the coming out process , in journal of homosexuality , 1982 : '' core gender and sex-role identities are well-formed by the age of 3 ( money & ehrhardt , 1972 ) this is believed because attempts to reassign gender identity after age 3 result in further gender dysphoria barbara newmann breaks it down into four parts : ( 1 ) understanding the concept of gender , ( 2 ) learning gender role standards and stereotypes , ( 3 ) identifying with parents , and ( 4 ) forming gender preference according to un agencies , discussions relating to comprehensive sexuality education raise awareness of topics , such as gender and gender identity in particular , the extent to which it is determined by socialization ( environmental factors ) versus innate ( biological ) factors is an ongoing debate in psychology , known as '' nature versus nurture '' 44 : '' when assigned and raised as boys , these genetic girls adopt a male gender identity and role , showing that a y chromosome is not necessary for gender development to proceed in a male direction '' social factors which may influence gender identity include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family , authority figures , mass media , and other influential people in a child 's life when children are raised by individuals who adhere to stringent gender roles , they are more likely to behave in the same way , matching their gender identity with the corresponding stereotypical gender patterns john money was instrumental in the early research of gender identity , though he used the term gender role he disagreed with the previous school of thought that gender was determined solely by biology he argued that infants are born a blank slate and a parent could be able to decide their babies â€™ gender in money 's opinion , if the parent confidently raised their child as the opposite sex , the child would believe that they were born that sex and act accordingly a well-known example in the nature-versus-nurture debate is the case of david reimer , otherwise known as '' john/joan '' diamond had contributed to research involving pregnant rats that showed hormones played a major role in the behavior of different sexes the researchers in the lab would inject the pregnant rat with testosterone , which would then find its way to the baby 's bloodstream the females that were born had genitalia that looked like male genitalia the females in the litter also behaved like male rats and would even try to mount other female rats , proving that biology played a major role in animal behavior griet vandermassen argues that since these are the only two cases being documented in scientific literature , this makes it difficult to draw any firm conclusions from them about the origins of gender identity , particularly given the two cases reached different conclusions who 's afraid of charles darwin ?
