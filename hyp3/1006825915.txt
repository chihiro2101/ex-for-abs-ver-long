the concept of reconfigurable computing has existed since the 1960s , when gerald estrin 's paper proposed the concept of a computer made of a standard processor and an array of '' reconfigurable '' hardware the main processor would control the behavior of the reconfigurable hardware in the 1980s and 1990s there was a renaissance in this area of research with many proposed reconfigurable architectures developed in industry and academia , c and wawrzynek , john , '' garp : a mips processor with a reconfigurable coprocessor '' , proceedings of the ieee symposium on field-programmable custom computing machines ( fccm '97 , april 16â€“18 , 1997 ) , pp , '' a vliw processor with reconfigurable instruction set for embedded applications '' , solid-state circuits conference , 2003 computer scientist reiner hartenstein describes reconfigurable computing in terms of an anti-machine that , according to him , represents a fundamental paradigm shift away from the more conventional von neumann machine high-performance reconfigurable computing ( hprc ) is a computer architecture combining reconfigurable computing-based accelerators like field-programmable gate array with cpus or multi-core processors the increase of logic in an fpga has enabled larger and more complex algorithms to be programmed into the fpga the attachment of such an fpga to a modern cpu over a high speed bus , like pci express , has enabled the configurable logic to act more like a coprocessor rather than a peripheral this has brought reconfigurable computing into the high-performance computing sphere the us national science foundation has a center for high-performance reconfigurable computing ( chrec ) commercial high-performance reconfigurable computing systems are beginning to emerge with the announcement of ibm integrating fpgas with its power processor partial re-configuration is the process of changing a portion of reconfigurable hardware circuitry while the other portion keeps its former configuration normally , reconfiguring an fpga requires it to be held in reset while an external controller reloads a design onto it partial reconfiguration allows for critical parts of the design to continue operating while a controller either on the fpga or off of it loads a partial design into a reconfigurable module partial reconfiguration also can be used to save space for multiple designs by only storing the partial designs that change between designs such projects are built with reconfigurable hardware ( fpgas ) , and some devices support emulation of multiple vintage computers using a single reconfigurable hardware ( c-one ) the quartus prime pro software also support hierarchical partial reconfiguration and simulation of partial reconfiguration the granularity of the reconfigurable logic is defined as the size of the smallest functional unit ( configurable logic block , clb ) that is addressed by the mapping tools intuitively , the slower the rate of reconfiguration the smaller the energy consumption as the associated energy cost of reconfiguration are amortised over a longer period of time however , there have also been implementations where the reconfigurable fabric is much closer to the processor , some are even implemented into the data path , utilising the processor registers one of the key challenges for reconfigurable computing is to enable higher design productivity and provide an easier way to use reconfigurable computing systems for users that are unfamiliar with the underlying concepts
