one of the symptoms of conduct disorder is a lower level of fear the findings support that if a caregiver is able to respond to infant cues , the toddler has a better ability to respond to fear and distress if the caregiver is able to provide therapeutic intervention teaching children at risk better empathy skills , the child will have a lower incident level of conduct disorder '' toddlers ' empathy-related responding to distress : predictions from negative emotionality and maternal behavior in infancy conduct disorder can present with limited prosocial emotions , lack of remorse or guilt , lack of empathy , lack of concern for performance , and shallow or deficient affect , a bat , brick , broken bottle , knife , gun ) has been physically cruel to people has been physically cruel to animals has stolen while confronting a victim ( e.g , mugging , purse snatching , extortion , armed robbery ) has forced someone into sexual activity ( rape or molestation ) currently , two possible developmental courses are thought to lead to conduct disorder the first is known as the '' childhood-onset type '' and occurs when conduct disorder symptoms are present before the age of 10 years research has shown that there is a greater number of children with adolescent-onset conduct disorder than those with childhood-onset , suggesting that adolescent-onset conduct disorder is an exaggeration of developmental behaviors that are typically seen in adolescence , such as rebellion against authority figures and rejection of conventional values in addition to these two courses that are recognized by the dsm-iv-tr , there appears to be a relationship among oppositional defiant disorder , conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder specifically , research has demonstrated continuity in the disorders such that conduct disorder is often diagnosed in children who have been previously diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder , and most adults with antisocial personality disorder were previously diagnosed with conduct disorder for example , some research has shown that 90 % of children diagnosed with conduct disorder had a previous diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder moreover , both disorders share relevant risk factors and disruptive behaviors , suggesting that oppositional defiant disorder is a developmental precursor and milder variant of conduct disorder in fact , only about 25 % of children with oppositional defiant disorder will receive a later diagnosis of conduct disorder nonetheless , many of the individuals who do not meet full criteria for antisocial personality disorder still exhibit a pattern of social and personal impairments or antisocial behaviors these developmental trajectories suggest the existence of antisocial pathways in certain individuals , which have important implications for both research and treatment specifically , risk factors associated with conduct disorder and the effects of conduct disorder symptomatology on a child 's psychosocial context have been linked to overlap with other psychological disorders in this way , there seems to be reciprocal effects of comorbidity with certain disorders , leading to increased overall risk for these youth while it is unlikely that adhd alone is a risk factor for developing conduct disorder , children who exhibit hyperactivity and impulsivity along with aggression is associated with the early onset of conduct problems children with conduct disorder have an earlier onset of substance use , as compared to their peers , and also tend to use multiple substances however , substance use disorders themselves can directly or indirectly cause conduct disorder like traits in about half of adolescents who have a substance use disorder as mentioned above , it seems that there is a transactional relationship between substance use and conduct problems , such that aggressive behaviors increase substance use , which leads to increased aggressive behavior substance use in conduct disorder can lead to antisocial behavior in adulthood while the cause of conduct disorder is complicated by an intricate interplay of biological and environmental factors , identifying underlying mechanisms is crucial for obtaining accurate assessment and implementing effective treatment protective factors have also been identified , and most notably include high iq , being female , positive social orientations , good coping skills , and supportive family and community relationships the role of neuropsychological deficits in conduct disorders for instance , antisocial behavior suggestive of conduct disorder is associated with single parent status , parental divorce , large family size , and young age of mothers in addition to the individual and social factors associated with conduct disorder , research has highlighted the importance of environment and context in youth with antisocial behavior transactional models propose that youth may resort to violence more often as a result of exposure to community violence , but their predisposition towards violence also contributes to neighborhood climate about 25-40 % of youths diagnosed with conduct disorder qualify for a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder when they reach adulthood moreover , conduct disorder in females is linked to several negative outcomes , such as antisocial personality disorder and early pregnancy , suggesting that sex differences in disruptive behaviors need to be more fully understood
