in 1860 , joseph swan produced carbon fibers for the first time , for use in light bulbs in 1880 , lewis latimer developed a reliable carbon wire filament for the incandescent light bulb , heated by electricity in 1958 , roger bacon created high-performance carbon fibers at the union carbide parma technical center located outside of cleveland , ohio this process proved to be inefficient , as the resulting fibers contained only about 20 % carbon and had low strength and stiffness properties this had produced a carbon fiber that contained about 55 % carbon these carbon fibers had sufficient strength ( modulus of elasticity and tensile strength ) to be used as a reinforcement for composites having high strength to weight properties and for high temperature resistant applications the high potential strength of carbon fiber was realized in 1963 in a process developed by w the process was patented by the uk ministry of defence , then licensed by the british national research development corporation to three companies : rolls-royce , who were already making carbon fiber ; morganite ; and courtaulds during the 1960s , experimental work to find alternative raw materials led to the introduction of carbon fibers made from a petroleum pitch derived from oil processing also , during this period , the japanese government heavily supported carbon fiber development at home and several japanese companies such as toray , nippon carbon , toho rayon and mitsubishi started their own development and production since the late 1970s , further types of carbon fiber yarn entered the global market , offering higher tensile strength and higher elastic modulus carbon fiber is frequently supplied in the form of a continuous tow wound onto a reel each carbon filament in the tow is a continuous cylinder with a diameter of 5–10 micrometres and consists almost exclusively of carbon the atomic structure of carbon fiber is similar to that of graphite , consisting of sheets of carbon atoms arranged in a regular hexagonal pattern ( graphene sheets ) , the difference being in the way these sheets interlock carbon fibers derived from polyacrylonitrile are turbostratic , whereas carbon fibers derived from mesophase pitch are graphitic after heat treatment at temperatures exceeding 2200 & nbsp ; °c turbostratic carbon fibers tend to have high ultimate tensile strength , whereas heat-treated mesophase-pitch-derived carbon fibers have high young 's modulus ( i.e carbon fiber is most notably used to reinforce composite materials , particularly the class of materials known as carbon fiber reinforced polymer for example , 200 & nbsp ; tex for 3,000 & nbsp ; filaments of carbon fiber is three times as strong as 1,000 & nbsp ; carbon filament yarn , but is also three times as heavy basalt fiber carbon fiber reinforced polymer ceramic matrix composite carbon nanotube esd materials graphene
