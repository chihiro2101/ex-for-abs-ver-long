in december 1998 , the ietf published - definition of the differentiated services field ( ds field ) in the ipv4 and ipv6 headers , which replaced the ipv4 tos field with the ds field in the ds field , a range of eight values ( class selectors ) is used for backward compatibility with the ip precedence specification in the former tos field today , diffserv has largely supplanted tos and other layer 3 qos mechanisms , such as integrated services ( intserv ) , as the primary architecture routers use to provide qos rather than differentiating network traffic based on the requirements of an individual flow , diffserv operates on the principle of traffic classification , placing each data packet into one of a limited number of traffic classes each traffic class can be managed differently , ensuring preferential treatment for higher-priority traffic on the network core routers simply apply phb treatment to packets based on their markings while diffserv does recommend a standardized set of traffic classes , the diffserv architecture does not incorporate predetermined judgments of what types of traffic should be given priority treatment network traffic entering a diffserv domain is subjected to classification and conditioning traffic classifiers may honor any diffserv markings in received packets or may elect to ignore or override those markings for tight control over volumes and type of traffic in a given class , a network operator may choose not to honor markings at the ingress to the diffserv domain traffic in each class may be further conditioned by subjecting the traffic to rate limiting , traffic policers or shapers filtering dscp in theory , a network could have up to 64 different traffic classes using the 64 available dscp values because an overload of ef traffic will cause queuing delays and affect the jitter and delay tolerances within the class , admission control , traffic policing and other mechanisms may be applied to ef traffic the af behavior group defines four separate af classes with all traffic within one class having the same priority ) — supplemental information for the new definition of the ef phb ( expedited forwarding per-hop behavior ) — a differentiated services code point ( dscp ) for capacity-admitted traffic
