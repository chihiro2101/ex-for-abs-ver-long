the radio church of god began with herbert w armstrong , who in 1931 was ordained by the oregon conference of the church of god ( seventh-day ) , an adventist group , and began serving a congregation in eugene , oregon it was essentially a condensed church service on the air , with hymn singing featured along with armstrong 's message , and it was the launching point for what would become the radio church of god although his views were rejected by the local congregation , he gained a growing following of his own , chiefly through his world tomorrow broadcasts and the plain truth magazine to facilitate the work of the growing church , he incorporated it on march 3 , 1946 , as the radio church of god in 1947 , ambassador college was founded in pasadena by the church , and the campus served as the church 's headquarters the broadcast of the world tomorrow went into europe on radio luxembourg on january 7 , 1953 in 1956 , armstrong published the booklet 1975 in prophecy ! , which predicted an upcoming nuclear war and subsequent enslavement of mankind , leading to the second coming in 1971 armstrong criticized teachings that christ would return in 1975 and that the church should flee to a '' place of safety '' in 1972 , as no man knew the time of christ 's return ( matthew 24:36 and 25:13 ) because of his strong emphasis on these prophetic dates , the church grew quickly in the late 1960s and , on january 5 , 1968 , was renamed the worldwide church of god armstrong 's son , garner ted armstrong , who had been given the responsibility to host the radio and later the television version of the world tomorrow , was formally disfellowshipped by his father in 1972 while church members were told at the time that the reason was ted armstrong 's opposition to some of his father 's teachings , ted armstrong later admitted that the actual reason was his relationships with many women herbert armstrong , who resumed the broadcasting duties of the world tomorrow program , did not reconcile with ted before his death other churches with different doctrines , such as a three personage 'trinity ' , were taught as being satanic counterfeits every third year , members gave an additional tithe to help '' widows and orphans '' of the church church headquarters and the former , beautiful , ambassador college , were located in pasadena , california , on prime real estate sixteen years before armstrong died , in 1970 , there began a splintering away from the church a group led by carl o'beirn of cleveland , ohio may have been the first to leave these factions survived well past herbert armstrong 's death in 1986 , most retaining the name church of god because armstrong had pointed out that this is the name god calls his church in the bible armstrong began to more urgently preach the gospel of the kingdom , around the world '' he began undertaking humanitarian projects in underprivileged locales around the world , which sparked the creation of the church-run ambassador international cultural foundation ( aicf ) in 1975 the church auditorium hosted , at highly subsidized ticket prices , hundreds of performances by noted artists such as luciano pavarotti , vladimir horowitz , bing crosby , marcel marceau , and bob hope ( the use of the year 1975 was defended by church ministers as a device to explain biblical prophecy , by contrasting it with the scientific world 's declaration of 1975 as the year of technological '' utopia '' ) many members were disappointed that the events predicted in biblical prophecy , expounded and preached about by herbert armstrong , had not yet come to pass most were unaware that herbert armstrong had been preaching about revelation and bible prophecy on the radio as far back as world war ii this was a springboard that the 10 kings , 10 horns , 10 crowns of revelation reveal a european union would rise up to become the beast power because church literature such as the wonderful world tomorrow , 1975 in prophecy ! , and many others had attempted to pinpoint the date of christ 's return , members continued to wait anxiously for the second coming some ( such as gerald waterhouse ) presented detailed , step-by-step accounts of the second coming in their sermons , which included armstrong himself as one of two witnesses of the book of revelation herbert armstrong began to speak openly and critically of his son in a report in the may 15 , 1972 , edition of time magazine , herbert armstrong was reported to have said that garner ted was '' in the bonds of satan while garner ted armstrong was removed , stanley rader was orchestrating the church 's involvement in a number of corporations which rader and herbert w rader characterized his involvement as that of an adviser and claimed that his advice was opening doors for armstrong that a strict theological role would not have allowed for herbert armstrong claimed that he did not approve of the establishment of the aicf , which rader set up ostensibly to give the elder armstrong a role as the '' ambassador for world peace without portfolio '' garner ted armstrong began his own church in 1978 in tyler , texas , after the rivalry between the younger armstrong and stanley rader intensified this action was infuriating to the younger armstrong , who thought it his birthright to take over as the leader of the church in 1978 , after a failed attempt to seize control of the church from the elder armstrong , garner ted armstrong was disfellowshipped a final time garner ted moved to tyler , texas , and there founded a splinter group , the church of god international about this time the gap between father and son was set when garner ted threatened to expose the secret of herbert 's molesting his sister in the later 1930s a coalition of six ex-ministers brought accusations of misappropriation of funds directed against herbert w this action by the state of california was later dismissed and determined by the presiding judge to have been illegal garner ted armstrong blamed stanley rader for his two-time ousting from his father 's church several members in good standing with the worldwide church of god at the time prompted the state of california to investigate charges of malfeasance by rader and herbert w the matter gained the attention of mike wallace who investigated the church in a report for 60 minutes until armstrong 's death , the worldwide church of god adhered to its founder 's teachings the first tithe , 10 percent of a member 's total income , was sent to church headquarters to finance '' the work '' , which was all operations of the church , as well as broadcasting and publishing the church 's message to further economize , the church sold its properties in pasadena and purchased an office building in glendora , california 1989 ) church of the great god ( 1992 ) global church of god ( 1992 ) united church of god ( 1995 ) living church of god ( 1998 ) restored church of god ( 1998 ) church of god , a worldwide association ( 2010 ) continuing church of god ( 2012 ) cartwright d
