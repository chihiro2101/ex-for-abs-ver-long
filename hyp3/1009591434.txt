a significant number of moorcock 's novels and short stories take place in one shared multiverse : a wide array of interconnected parallel universes , many-layered dimensions , spheres , and alternative worlds , which spans from the big bang to the end of time and from earth to faraway galaxies the eternal champion is , as a matter of fact , an appointed paladin of balance who is bound to exist in each and every world and age of the multiverse , so that law and chaos are perpetually kept in check ; however , he often does not know of his role , or , even worse , he struggles against it , never to succeed all the different eternal champions are implied to be different facets or '' incarnations '' of one semi-conscious being ( a platonic archetype of a sort ) : most of them are peerless fighters and generals and have an unbreakable bond with a sentient chaos-aligned weapon , the black sword , which in turns takes on a different form for each champion likewise , many champions are aided by an eternal companion and an eternal consort : a sidekick and a love interest who are themselves aspects of two semi-divine figures this recursivity through the multiverse is further underlined by the number of champions , companions , and mentor-figures to the champions moorcock has given the j and c initials , as a form of naming fil rouge ; in the same vein , many champions and companions belong to one branch or another of the extensive von bek dynasty space- and time-travels through the multiverse are in fact possible , to the point that one humanoid species called the eldrens is spread among many different worlds and ages and interacts with many different champions ; however , cosmic laws establish that no two eternal champions can coexist in the same situation , or the very fabric of reality would be severely damaged '' the blood red game '' was eventually combined with the earlier novella '' the sundered worlds '' ( 1962 ) into the full-length novel the sundered worlds ( 1965 ) , making asquiol somehow of a guest character into the von bek saga moorcock planned a whole series about aubec 's wars against melniboné in order to ensure human independence , eventually reconnecting to elric 's saga as a direct prequel , but the project was eventually aborted ; consequently , '' the dream of earl aubec '' was reincorporated into elric 's series as a prologue brian jherek carnelian : one of the last humans to be alive on earth as the multiverse is nearing the end of time , carnelian is a creature of semi-divine power , hedonistic interests , and obnoxious morality ( not unlike his fellow end-timers ) , but his lifestyle changes forever once he falls in love with mrs this series also includes two spin-off works , a doctor who licensed novel titled the coming of the terraphiles ( 2010 ) , whose captain cornelius is , in fact , jerry 's incarnation in the whoniverse ; and the distant suns ( 1975 ) , a late example of pulp space opera moorcock co-authored with james cawthorn , depicting jerry as an air force colonel and a space explorer moreover , it is implied that lord jagged of canaria from jherek carnelian 's series , jaspar colinadous from one of elric 's adventures , dorian hawkmoon 's jehamia cohnahlias , corum 's jhary-a-conel , and john daker 's jermays the crooked are jerry 's counterparts in their respective dimensions at the beginning of the novella '' the eternal champion '' ( 1962 ; expanded into a novel of the same title in 1970 ) erekosë has been dead for generations , but a necromantic ritual resurrects him as a new existence for john daker ; the reborn erekosë consequently gets entangled into a world war between humans and eldrens and into a love triangle between the two factions ' princesses , eldren ermizhad and human iolinda prince flamadin : flamadin is the ruler of a dimension called draachenheem and owns both the dragon sword ( a black sword comparable in power to ulrik skarlson 's cold sword ) and the actoris stone , an enchanted gem that would later become elric of melniboné 's family heirloom in the dragon in the sword ( 1986 ) daker as flamadin and his companion from 20th century germany , ulrich von bek , travel across many interconnected dimensions to prevent a major cataclysm elric 's series represents a major milestone in sword & sorcery fiction and , unlike moorcock 's later works , was composed anachronically : it originally consisted of seven short stories and a stormbringer ( novel ) written from 1961 to 1967 , but it was later expanded with an origin story , a prequel and a midquel in the early seventies , a third prequel and a second midquel in the early nineties , and some more peripheral contents during the early 21st century other noteworthy von beks across the cycle are : manfred von bek : the main character of the city in the autumn stars ( 1986 ) , a direct sequel to the war hound and the world 's pain , manfred carries on graf ulrich 's quest for the grail as europe is engulfed by the french revolution ;
