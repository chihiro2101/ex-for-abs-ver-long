there is specialized equipment used by team ropers : rope - made of synthetic fibers , used to rope the steer , there are two kinds of ropes , one for the header ( the person who ropes the head ) and one for the heeler ( the person who ropes the legs ) the heeler 's rope is usually 35 or 36 feet in length and is a lot stiffer ( meaning it contains less flexibility and is more rigid to catch the feet ) horn wraps - protective wraps that go around the horns of the steer to prevent rope burns and reduce the risk of a horn breaking when roped the header is on one side ( usually the left , for a right-handed header ) whose job is to rope the steer around the horns , then turn the steer so its hind legs can be roped by the '' heeler '' , who starts from the box on the other side of the chute a taut rope , called the barrier , runs in front of the header 's box and is fastened to an easily released rope on the neck of the steer of a designated length , used to ensure that the steer gets a head start once the header has made the dally , the rider turns the horse , usually to the left , and the steer will follow , still running as soon as the heeler also dallies tight , the header turns his or her horse to directly face the steer and heeler at higher levels , the header and the heeler are allowed only one throw each , if either misses , the team gets no score the header has three possible legal catches : both horns one horn and the nose ( half-head ) the neck any other head catch is considered illegal the lay of the loop is also very important ; it should stand up against the steer 's legs with the bottom loop on the ground so the steer will jump right into it
