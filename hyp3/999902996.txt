critical chain project management is based on methods and algorithms derived from theory of constraints according to studies of traditional project management methods by standish group and others as of 1998 , only 44 % of projects typically finish on time harvey maylor , project management in a project plan , the critical chain is the sequence of both precedence- and resource-dependent tasks that prevents a project from being completed in a shorter time , given finite resources if resources are always available in unlimited quantities , then a project 's critical chain is identical to its critical path method critical chain is an alternative to critical path analysis main features that distinguish critical chain from critical path are : use of ( often implicit ) resource dependencies implicit means that they are not included in the project network , but must be identified by looking at the resource requirements critical chain project management uses buffer management instead of earned value management to assess the performance of a project some project managers feel that the earned value management technique is misleading , because it does not distinguish progress on the project constraint ( i.e the '' extra '' duration of each task on the critical chain—the difference between the '' safe '' durations and the 50 % durations—is gathered in a buffer at the end of the project in 1999 , a researcher applied simulation to assess the impact of risks associated with each component of project work breakdown structure on project duration , cost and performance the ccpm literature contrasts this with '' traditional '' project management that monitors task start and completion dates
