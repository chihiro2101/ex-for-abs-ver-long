the first debate in crowd psychology began in rome at the first international congress of criminal anthropology on 16 november 1885 the meeting was dominated by cesare lombroso and his fellow italians , who emphasized the biological determinates : '' lombroso detailed before the first congress his theories of the physical anomalies of criminals and his classification of criminals as 'born criminals ' , or criminals by occasion and mattoids '' a weak response was offered by the french , who put forward an environmental theory of human psychology anguilli called attention to the importance of the influence of the social environment upon crime '' the psychology of crowd dynamics '' , blackwell handbook of social psychology : group processes ( sighele , 1892 ; tarde , 1890 , 1892 , 1901 ) literature on crowds and crowd behavior appeared as early as 1841 , with the publication of charles mackay 's book extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds the attitude towards crowds underwent an adjustment with the publication of hippolyte taine 's six-volume the origins of contemporary france ( 1875 ) while it is difficult to directly link his works to crowd behavior , it may be said that his thoughts stimulated further study of crowd behavior momboisse developed a system of four types : casual , conventional , expressive , and aggressive that is , a crowd changes its level of emotional intensity over time , and therefore , can be classed in any one of the four types generally , researchers in crowd psychology have focused on the negative aspects of crowds , but not all crowds are volatile or negative in nature during submergence , the individuals in the crowd lose their sense of individual self and personal responsibility contagion refers to the propensity for individuals in a crowd to unquestioningly follow the predominant ideas and emotions of the crowd in le bon 's view , this effect is capable of spreading between '' submerged '' individuals much like a disease suggestion refers to the period in which the ideas and emotions of the crowd are primarily drawn from a shared unconscious ideology this behavior comes from an archaic shared unconscious and is therefore uncivilized in nature in short , the individual submerged in the crowd loses self control as the '' collective mind '' takes over and makes the crowd member capable of violating personal or social norms clark mcphail points out studies which show that '' the madding crowd '' does not take on a life of its own , apart from the thoughts and intentions of members norris johnson , after investigating the who concert disaster concluded that the crowd was composed of many small groups of people mostly trying to help each other additionally , le bon 's theory ignores the socio-cultural context of the crowd , which some theorists argue can disempower social change sigmund freud 's crowd behavior theory primarily consists of the idea that becoming a member of a crowd serves to unlock the unconscious mind this occurs because the super-ego , or moral center of consciousness , is displaced by the larger crowd , to be replaced by a charismatic crowd leader mcdougall argues similarly to freud , saying that simplistic emotions are widespread , and complex emotions are rarer theodor adorno criticized the belief in a spontaneity of the masses : according to him , the masses were an artificial product of '' administrated '' modern life furthermore , adorno stated the bond linking the masses to the leader through the spectacle is feigned : '' when the leaders become conscious of mass psychology and take it into their own hands , it ceases to exist in a certain sense convergence theory holds that crowd behavior is not a product of the crowd , but rather the crowd is a product of the coming together of like-minded individuals '' convergence theory holds that crowds form from people of similar dispositions , whose actions are then reinforced and intensified by the crowd the group identity serves to create a set of standards for behavior ; for certain groups violence is legitimate , for others it is unacceptable gustave le bon ( 1895 ) psychology of crowds p van de sande , on crowds ( dutch and english ) '' crowd disasters '' by prof
