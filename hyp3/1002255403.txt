the first practical large-scale application of stratigraphy was by william smith in the 1790s and early 19th century known as the '' father of english geology '' , smith recognized the significance of strata or rock layering and the importance of fossil markers for correlating strata ; he created the first geologic map of england the basic concept in stratigraphy , called the law of superposition , states : in an undeformed stratigraphic sequence , the oldest strata occur at the base of the sequence biostratigraphy or paleontology stratigraphy is based on fossil evidence in the rock layers biologic stratigraphy was based on william smith 's principle of faunal succession , which predated , and was one of the first and most powerful lines of evidence for , biological evolution the geologic time scale was developed during the 19th century , based on the evidence of biologic stratigraphy and faunal succession chronostratigraphy is the branch of stratigraphy that places an absolute age , rather than a relative age on rock strata the ultimate aim of chronostratigraphy is to place dates on the sequence of deposition of all rocks within a geological region , and then to every region , and by extension to provide an entire geologic record of the earth for sedimentary rocks this is possible because , as they fall through the water column , very fine-grained magnetic minerals ( < & nbsp ; 17 & nbsp ; Î¼m ) behave like tiny compasses , orienting themselves with earth 's magnetic field if the ancient magnetic field were oriented similar to today 's field ( north magnetic pole near the north pole ) , the strata would retain a normal polarity assise bed ( geology ) conodont biostratigraphy erygmascope ( old instrument for studying strata ) harris matrix important publications in stratigraphy international commission on stratigraphy key bed sedimentary basin analysis sequence stratigraphy sadler effect tectonostratigraphy ics subcommission for stratigraphic information university of south carolina sequence stratigraphy web front range stratigraphy international commission on stratigraphy university of georgia ( usa ) stratigraphy lab stratigraphy.net a stratigraphic data provider
