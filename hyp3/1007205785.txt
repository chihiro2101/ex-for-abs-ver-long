although usually not cost-effective , glycerol can be produced by various routes from propene this epichlorohydrin is then hydrolyzed to give glycerol chlorine-free processes from propylene include the synthesis of glycerol from acrolein and propylene oxide : because of the large-scale production of biodiesel from fats , where glycerol is a waste product , the market for glycerol is depressed owing to oversupply , efforts are being made to convert glycerol to synthetic precursors , such as acrolein and epichlorohydrin in food and beverages , glycerol serves as a humectant , solvent , and sweetener , and may help preserve foods glycerol and water are used to preserve certain types of plant leaves as a sugar substitute , it has approximately 27 food energy per teaspoon ( sugar has 20 ) and is 60 % as sweet as sucrose as a food additive , glycerol is labeled as e number e422 as used in foods , glycerol is categorized by the u.s glycerol is used in medical , pharmaceutical and personal care preparations , often as a means of improving smoothness , providing lubrication , and as a humectant glycerol is also used in blood banking to preserve red blood cells prior to freezing this kind of soap is used by people with sensitive , easily irritated skin because it prevents skin dryness with its moisturizer properties this can be useful for the initial emergency treatment of severely elevated eye pressure glycerol has also been incorporated as a component of bio-ink formulations in the field of bioprinting when utilized in '' tincture '' method extractions , specifically as a 10 % solution , glycerol prevents tannins from precipitating in ethanol extracts of plants ( tinctures ) it is also used as an '' alcohol-free '' alternative to ethanol as a solvent in preparing herbal extractions alcohol-based tinctures can also have the alcohol removed and replaced with glycerol for its preserving properties such products are not '' alcohol-free '' in a scientific or fda regulatory sense , as glycerol contains three hydroxyl groups both glycerol and ethanol are viable preserving agents glycerol is bacteriostatic in its action , and ethanol is bactericidal in its action the minimum freezing point temperature is about corresponding to 70 % glycerol in water glycerol was historically used as an anti-freeze for automotive applications before being replaced by ethylene glycol , which has a lower freezing point glycerol is one of the most used additive for starch thermoplastic direct glycerol treatment of testes has been found to cause significant long-term reduction in sperm count in adipose tissue , glycerol 3-phosphate is obtained from dihydroxyacetone phosphate ( dhap ) with the enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase the cheaper diethylene glycol was relabeled as the more expensive glycerol
