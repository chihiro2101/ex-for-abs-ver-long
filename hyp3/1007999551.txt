in the new testament , the word translated as 'repentance ' is the greek word μετάνοια ( metanoia ) , '' after/behind one 's mind '' , which is a compound word of the preposition 'meta ' ( after , with ) , and the verb 'noeo ' ( to perceive , to think , the result of perceiving or observing ) in this compound word , the preposition combines the two meanings of time and change , which may be denoted by 'after ' and 'different ' ; so that the whole compound means : 'to think differently after ' metanoia is therefore primarily an after-thought , different from the former thought ; a change of mind and change of conduct , '' change of mind and heart '' , or , '' change of consciousness '' the doctrine of repentance as taught in the bible is a call to persons to make a radical turn from one way of life to another 118-119 it is a change of mind that involves a conscious turning away from wrong actions , attitudes and thoughts that conflict with a godly lifestyle and biblical commands , and an intentional turning toward doing that which the bible says pleases god many rabbinic sources state that repentance is of paramount importance to the existence of this world , so that it was one of the seven provisions which god made before the creation ' & nbsp ; '' jerusalem talmud sanhedrin 28b '' great is repentance : it brings healing into the world '' ; '' it reaches to the throne of the lord '' ; '' it brings redemption '' ; '' it prolongs man 's life '' ; talmud yoma 86a ) '' repentance and works of charity are man 's intercessors before god 's throne '' talmud shabbath 32a sincere repentance is equivalent to the rebuilding of the temple , the restoration of the altar , and the offering of all the sacrifices buber , 25:158 ; midrash leviticus rabbah 7 ; talmud sanhedrin 43b ) sincere repentance is manifested when the same temptation to sin , under the same conditions , is ever after resolutely resisted ( talmud taanith 16a ; mishneh torah teshuva 2:3 ) according to jewish doctrine , repentance is the prerequisite of atonement talmud rosh hashan 18a ; mishneh torah teshuva 2:6 repentance and the day of atonement only absolve one from sins committed against god ; from sins against another person they absolve only when restitution has been made and the pardon of the offended party has been obtained talmud yoma 87a ; mishneh torah teshuva2:9 no one need despair on account of his or her sins , for every penitent sinner is graciously received by god jewish doctrine holds that it is never too late , even on the day of death , to return to god with sincere repentance for '' as the sea is always open for every one who wishes to cleanse himself , so are the gates of repentance always open to the sinner '' ( talmud pesachim 119a ; deuteronomy rabbah ii ) one view in the talmud holds that a repentant sinner attains a more exalted spiritual eminence than one who has never sinned ( talmud bava metsia 58b ; mishneh torah teshuva 8:8 ) repentance occupies a prominent position in all the ethical writings of the middle ages one of the most significant medieval works on repentance is '' shaarei teshuva , '' the '' gates of repentance '' by yonah gerondi however , jonah returned to disobedience when he hoped for the destruction of the city of nineveh however , the prophets disparaged all such outer manifestations of repentance , insisting rather on a complete change of the sinner 's mental and spiritual attitude the protestant reformer john calvin wrote that repentance '' may be justly defined to be a true conversion of our life to god , proceeding from a serious fear of god , and consisting in the mortification of the flesh and of the old man , and in the vivification of the spirit the act of repentance can redeem the sins and give the opportunity to go to heaven : : o you who have believed , repent to allah with sincere repentance an-nisaa 4:48 islam does not accept the concept of original sin ; instead , it teaches that a person is born in a state of innocence and pure belief
