the data suggests humans were cooking prey by campfire as far back as the first appearance of homo erectus 1.9 million years ago if a fire ring is not available , a temporary fire site may be constructed bare rock or unvegetated ground is ideal for a fire site another way is to cover the ground with sand , or other soil mostly free of flammable organic material , to a depth of a few inches a ring of rocks is sometimes constructed around a fire fire rings , however , do not fully protect material on the ground from catching fire minimizing the size of the fire to prevent problems from occurring making sure the fire pit is large enough for the campfire and there are no combustibles near the campfire , and avoiding the construction of the campfire on a windy day there are , by conventional classification , three types of material involved in building a fire without manufactured fuels or modern conveniences such as lighters tinder lights easily and is used to start an enduring campfire kindling wood is an arbitrary classification including anything bigger than tinder but smaller than fuel wood a faggot is a related term indicating a bundle of small branches used to feed a small fire or continue developing a bigger fire out of a small one in heavily used campsites , fuel wood can be hard to find , so it may have to purchased at a nearby store or be brought from home however , untreated wood should not be transported due to the probability that invasive species of bugs will be transported with it parks almost always forbid cutting living trees , and may also prohibit collecting dead parts of standing trees often , charcoal lighters like hexamine fuel tablets or ethyl alcohol will be used to start the fire , as well as various types of scrap paper most of them make no mention of fuelwoodâ€”in most designs , fuelwood is never placed on a fire until the kindling is burning strongly for added strength , it may be possible to lash some of the sticks together a tripod lashing is quite difficult to execute with small sticks , so a clove hitch should suffice tipi fires are excellent for producing heat to keep people warm one downside to a tipi fire is that when it burns , the logs become unstable and can fall over the first two kindling sticks are laid parallel to each other , on opposite sides of the tinder pile the second pair is laid on top of the first , at right angles to it , and also on opposite sides of the tinder the smallest kindling is placed over the top of the assembly however , these qualities make the log cabin an ideal cooking fire as it burns for a long period of time and can support cookware its main difference from the standard log cabin is that it starts with thin pieces and moves up to thick pieces the hybrid is made by first erecting a small tipi and then proceeding to construct a log cabin around it a cross-fire is built by positioning two pieces of wood with the tinder in between then , a long , thick piece of kindling is driven into the ground at an angle , so that it overhangs the tinder pile in an alternative method , a large piece of fuelwood or log can be placed on the ground next to the tinder pile then kindling is placed with one end propped up by the larger piece of fuelwood , and the other resting on the ground so that the kindling is leaning over the tinder pile this method is useful in very high winds , as the piece of fuel wood acts as a windbreak a small , enclosed fire that has slowed down may require vigorous blowing to get it going again , but excess blowing can extinguish a fire campers sometimes use elaborate grills , cast iron pots , and fire irons to cook splashing the water is both more effective and efficient in extinguishing the fire once the fire is covered thoroughly with sand , water is then added over the fire wood and cardboard are used as tinder file : scoutcampfire.jpg a campfire that seems to produce sparks , due to a long exposure when photographed
