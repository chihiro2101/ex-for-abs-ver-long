it forms an equilibrium mixture with nitrogen dioxide the liquid is also colorless but can appear as a brownish yellow liquid due to the presence of no 2 according to the following equilibrium : : n 2 o 4 â‡Œ 2 no 2 higher temperatures push the equilibrium towards nitrogen dioxide inevitably , some dinitrogen tetroxide is a component of smog containing nitrogen dioxide the gas is essentially pure nitrogen dioxide , which is condensed into dinitrogen tetroxide in a brine-cooled liquefier dinitrogen tetroxide can also be made through the reaction of concentrated nitric acid and metallic copper this synthesis is more practical in a laboratory setting and is commonly used as a demonstration or experiment in undergraduate chemistry labs the unstable species further react to form nitrogen dioxide which is then purified and condensed to form dinitrogen tetroxide nitrogen tetroxide is used as an oxidizer in one of the most important rocket propellants because it can be stored as a liquid at room temperature gemini and apollo spacecraft and also on the space shuttle , it continues to be used as station-keeping propellant on most geo-stationary satellites , and many deep-space probes when used as a propellant , dinitrogen tetroxide is usually referred to simply as nitrogen tetroxide and the abbreviation nto is extensively used '' cool '' dinitrogen tetroxide is compressed and heated , causing it to dissociate into nitrogen dioxide at half the molecular weight
