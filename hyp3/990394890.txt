breguet was born in neuchâtel to jonas-louis breguet and suzanne-marguerite bollein breguet 's mother remarried to joseph tattet , who came from a family of watchmakers tattet had a showroom in paris ; the family tried for some time to entice the young breguet into the trade , to no avail , but he eventually took to it with great interest and in 1762 , aged 15 , he was sent to be apprenticed to an unknown versailles master watchmaker the young breguet soon '' astonished '' his master with his aptitude and intelligence , and to further his education he took evening classes in mathematics at the collège mazarin under abbé marie , who became a friend and mentor to the young watchmaker salomons , 1921 , p.11 unfortunately , marie met a tragic end , either through murder or suicide , and soon after breguet lost both his mother and his step-father , leaving him to support himself and his younger sister david salomons , breguet 1747-1823 , ( london , 1921 , privately published ) , p.9-10 breguet was allowed to marry in 1775 after finishing his apprenticeship he and his bride , cécile marie-louise l'huillier , set up their home and the breguet watchmaking company ; its first known address was at 51 , quai de l'horloge in the île de la cité in paris ( by the 1920s this location was designated as 39 ) 1812 the firm 's address was 79 , quai de l'horloge du palais , although salomons speculated that this might have been merely a change of number and name , not of actual location by the year of breguet 's death in 1823 the firm also had a shop at 4 , place de la bourse , which is known because both addresses appear on the label of watch 4004 salomons , 1921 , p.8 breguet invented innovative escapements , including the tourbillon , automatic winding mechanisms , pages 110-121 , 362-370 the duke showed arnold a clock made by breguet , who was so impressed that he immediately travelled to paris and asked breguet to accept his son as an apprentice salomons , 1921 , p.10 as breguet 's fame gradually increased he became friendly with revolutionary leader jean-paul marat , who also hailed from neuchâtel breguet did not staff his workshops in the traditional way , with unskilled apprentices , but instead sought out the finest available watchmakers in paris , whom he employed to make watches to his own designs at the 1798 exposition des produits de l'industrie française breguet was given an honorable distinction , the highest award , for '' a free escapement with constant force , applicable to the improvement of both astronomical clocks and longitude clocks after antoine-louis retired in 1833 ( he died in 1858 ) the business continued under abraham-louis ' grandson louis-françois-clement breguet ( 1804–1883 ) ; his great-grandson louis antoine ( 1851–1882 ) was the last of the breguet family to run the business although he had two sons and a daughter , they did not enter the business , so he took on noted english watchmaker edward brown of clerkenwell to look after the paris factory breguet made three series of watches , and the highest numbering of the three reached 5120 , so in all it is estimated that the firm produced around 17,000 timepieces during breguet 's life following his introduction to the court , queen marie-antoinette developed a fascination for breguet 's unique self-winding watch and louis xvi of france bought several pieces in fact , it was commissioned in 1783 by a member of the marie-antoinette guards , possibly as a gift for the queen , and it took almost twenty years to complete—work stopped for around seven years ( 1789–1795 ) during the period of breguet 's exile—and it was not finished until around 1802 even by the standards of the day it was an astronomically expensive piece ; the commission specifically called for every watch function and complication known at that time and the use of the most valuable materials ( including gold , platinum , rubies and sapphires ) , with no limit placed on time or cost the '' marie antoinette '' remained in the possession of the breguet company until it was sold to sir spencer brunton in 1887 , eventually finding its way into the collection of breguet expert david lionel goldsmid-stern-salomons in the 1920s david salomons , breguet 1747-1823 ( privately published , 1921 ) , p.46 breguet 's most remarkable piece anticipated the wristwatch by a century ; he designed this , together with his friend john arnold , for caroline bonaparte , queen of naples , in 1810 he returned to paris overflowing with the ideas that produced the breguet balance-spring , his first carriage clock ( sold to house of bonaparte ) , the sympathique clock and its dependent watch , the tact watch , and finally the tourbillon , patented in 1801 the gold cover plate protected the mechanism , which bore another signature by breguet , and the watch number since their invention , breguet hands have graced watch and clock dials alike until today generally speaking , abraham-louis breguet was distinguished by the highest attention paid to aesthetic watch design
