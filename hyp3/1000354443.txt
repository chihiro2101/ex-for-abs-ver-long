there is no provision for the role of political parties in the united states constitution , since the founding fathers did not originally intend for american politics to be partisan 10 , alexander hamilton and james madison , respectively , wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic political factions thus in the first two presidential elections , the electoral college handled the nominations and elections in 1789 and 1792 that selected george washington richard hofstadter , the idea of a party system : the rise of legitimate opposition in the united states , 1780–1840 ( 1970 ) gordon s that system collapsed in 1824 , and since 1832 the preferred mechanism for nomination has been a national convention the first national convention was called by the anti-masonic party in 1831 , as they could not use the caucus system because they had no congressmen the party leaders instead called for a national meeting of supporters to set the party 's candidate this convention was held in baltimore on september 26 , 1831 which selected william wirt as their presidential candidate sometimes they were dominated by intrigue between political bosses who controlled delegates ; the national convention was far from democratic or transparent florida enacted the first presidential primary in 1901 the wisconsin direct open primary of 1905 was the first to eliminate the caucus and mandate direct selection of national convention delegates in 1910 , oregon became the first state to establish a presidential preference primary , which requires delegates to the national convention to support the winner of the primary at the convention by 1912 , twelve states either selected delegates in primaries , used a preferential primary , or both seeking to boost voter turnout , new hampshire simplified its ballot access laws in 1949 the first-in-the-nation new hampshire primary has since become a widely observed test of candidates ' viability the impetus for national adoption of the binding primary election was the chaotic 1968 democratic national convention vice president hubert humphrey secured the presidential nomination despite not winning a single primary under his own name a large number of states , faced with the need to conform to more detailed rules for the selection of national delegates , chose a presidential primary as an easier way to come into compliance with the new national democratic party rules the result was that many more future delegates would be selected by a state presidential primary with the broadened use of the primary system , states have tried to increase their influence in the nomination process another trend is to stage earlier and earlier primaries , given impetus by super tuesday and the mid-1990s move ( since repealed ) of the california primary and its bloc of votes—the largest in the nation—from june to march a major reason states try to increase their influence , and vie for earlier primaries , is that in recent years the races have usually been decided before the primary season has ended in june for example , john mccain officially clinched the 2008 republican presidential nomination in march , while during that same month barack obama held a substantial lead in pledged delegates in the democratic party primaries in 2012 , obama faced no major challenger in the democratic party primaries since he had the advantage of incumbency ( see below ) , while mitt romney gained enough delegates to be declared the presumptive republican nominee by late april in 2012 , both the republicans and the democrats moved their florida primary to january 31 , which was an earlier date than past election cycles in response , other states also changed their primary election dates for 2012 , in order to claim a greater influence , creating a cascade of changes in other states in the two major party 's rules , '' territories '' are referred to as '' states '' , which can be carried over in discussion and media implying there are more than 50 states an incumbent president seeking re-election usually faces no opposition during their respective party 's primaries , especially if they are still popular bush and barack obama , for example , their respective paths to nomination became uneventful and the races become merely pro forma ; all four then went on to win a second presidential term during the 1976 republican party primaries , then-former california governor reagan carried 23 states while running against incumbent president gerald ford ; ford then went on to lose the presidential election to jimmy carter senator ted kennedy then carried 12 states while running against carter during the 1980 democratic party primaries ; reagan then defeated carter in the fall both major political parties of the u.s.—the democratic party and the republican party—officially nominate their candidate for president at their respective national conventions republicans have three at-large delegates selected at the state convention from all the states and territories , 168 in number the remaining 15 % are unpledged superdelegates ( consisting of sitting democratic governors , sitting democratic members of congress ( i.e some superdelegates are former or current state or federal lobbyists franchise in a primary or caucus is governed by rules established by the state party , although the states may impose other regulations while most states hold primary elections , a handful of states hold caucuses one disadvantage of caucuses is that the state party runs the process directly instead of having the state and local governments run them nearly all states have a binding primary or caucus , in which the results of the election depending on state law or party rules legally bind some or all of the delegates to vote for a particular candidate at the national convention , for a certain number of ballots or until the candidate releases the delegates some binding primaries are winner-take-all contests , in which all of a state 's delegates are required to vote for the same candidate in a proportional vote , a state 's delegation is allocated in proportion to the candidates ' percent of the popular vote in a congressional district some states may use a binding walking subcaucus system , where voters may instead be choosing pledged delegates to a local , county or state party convention , which then in turn selects pledged delegates to the national convention in many states , only voters registered with a party may vote in that party 's primary , known as a closed primary a semi-open primary occurs when a voter must choose a party-specific ballot to cast , instead of being provided a single ballot where the voter must choose on the ballot itself which party 's primary to vote in in all of these systems , a voter may participate in only one primary ; that is , a voter who casts a vote for a candidate standing for the republican nomination for president can not cast a vote for a candidate standing for the democratic nomination , or vice versa both the democratic party and the republican party usually modify their delegate selection rules between presidential elections , including how delegates are allocated to each state and territory under the current democratic party selection rules , adopted in 2006 , pledged delegates are selected under proportional representation , which requires a candidate have a minimum of 15 % of a state 's popular vote to receive delegates in addition , the democratic party may reject any candidate under their bylaws each state publishes a delegate selection plan that notes the mechanics of calculating the number of delegates per congressional district , and how votes are transferred from local conventions to the state and national convention is based on two main factors : ( 1 ) the proportion of votes each state gave to the democratic candidate in the last three presidential elections , and ( 2 ) the number of electoral votes each state has in the united states electoral college territories of american samoa , guam , the northern mariana islands , puerto rico , and the us virgin islands are instead assigned a fixed number of pledged delegates in some cases , state law determines how delegates will be awarded and who may participate in the primary ; where it does not , party rules prevail the tuesday in february or march when the greatest number of states hold primary elections and caucuses is known as '' super tuesday '' the idea is that fewer initial primaries , typically in smaller states , would allow grassroots campaigns to score early successes and pick up steam the national association of secretaries of state has endorsed a rotating regional primary system , with the country split into four regions : the west , the midwest , the south , and the northeast
