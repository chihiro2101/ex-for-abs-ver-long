the aire and calder is a canalisation of the river calder from wakefield to castleford , where it joins the branch from leeds , which follows the river aire the section below haddlesey is no longer part of the navigation , as a derelict lock blocks access to the lower river instead , the selby canal flows northwards from haddlesey to the ouse at selby below dole bank junction , the knottingley and goole canal flows eastwards to join the ouse at goole from just before newbridge , where the modern a614 road crosses the waterway , this branch of the navigation runs parallel to the dutch river , an artificial channel built in 1635 to alleviate flooding caused by cornelius vermuyden 's original diversion of the river don northwards to the river aire in 1628 the aire and calder still fulfils its original purpose of linking leeds and wakefield with york and the humber ( and thence the trent ) , although the routes by which this is achieved have changed significantly beyond leeds , the leeds and liverpool canal carries boats over the pennines the calder and hebble navigation , which connects to the navigation at wakefield , allows boats to reach the huddersfield broad and narrow canals , and the rochdale canal the selby canal connects to the ouse , from where boats can travel upstream to reach york , boroughbridge and ripon , or downstream to the river derwent the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation , which can be reached via the new junction canal , forms a link with doncaster , rotherham and sheffield to the south west , and the tidal river trent at keadby to the east in the early 1600s , the river aire was navigable to knottingley , and boats carrying up to 30 & nbsp ; tons traded on the river , which was tidal up to this point the traders of leeds were keen to have a navigable link to the town , to make easier the export of woollen cloth , but bills presented to parliament in 1621 and 1625 had failed william pickering , who was mayor of leeds , had made further attempts to obtain an act of parliament for improvements to the river in 1679 , again without success although the bill had a lot of support , it was opposed by the city of york , who feared that the river ouse would be damaged by the scheme in 1744 , the undertakers bought some land at airmyn , and developed warehousing and wharfage there , as a more convenient point than rawcliffe , where the water was shallower during 1772 , they asked smeaton to survey a route to avoid the lower aire , but his assistant , william jessop actually carried out the work with parliament not reaching a decision , they reworked their plan , which was now for a canal from haddlesey to selby , with a new cut from ferrybridge to beal , and improvements above castleford in 1774 the leeds to selby bill was rejected by parliament , but the aire and calder bill was passed , aire and calder navigation act 1774 ( 14 geo the navigation remained profitable , paying £9,000 in dividends in 1775 , which had risen to £32,000 by 1791 selby was the upper limit for seagoing ships at the time , and became a major transhipment port for the smaller boats using the canal canal boats were limited to about 60 tons , whereas ships of up to 200 tons could reach selby in 1817 , there was a proposal for an aire and don canal , to connect knottingley to the dutch river at newbridge , with a branch to doncaster , and another for a went and wakefield canal , to connect cold hiendley on the barnsley canal to newbridge on the don with revenue from tolls reaching £82,092 in 1818 , which enabled a dividend of £54,000 to be paid , the company was in a healthy state , and proposed their own route from haddlesey to the dutch river those opposing the scheme were placated by a clause which ensured the aire to airmyn and the selby canal would be maintained around 1864 , the aire and calder dabbled in owning its own railways , purchasing the silkstone waggonway from the barnsley canal the eastern part of the navigation , sometimes known as the knottingley and goole canal , is rather different : it has long straight stretches , but mainly through flat land that has always been agricultural between wakefield and leeds , via castleford , the navigation is part of a circular cruising route or '' ring '' , formed by the leeds & liverpool and the huddersfield or rochdale canals
