the term klezmer comes from a combination of hebrew words : klei , meaning '' tools , utensils or instruments of '' and zemer , '' melody '' ; leading to k'lei zemer , literally '' instruments of music '' or '' musical instruments '' originally , klezmer referred to musical instruments , and was later extended to refer , as a pejorative , to musicians themselves early 20th century recordings and writings most often refer to the style as '' yiddish '' music , although it is also sometimes called freilech music ( yiddish , literally '' happy music '' ) the first recordings to use the term '' klezmer '' to refer to the music were the klezmorim 's east side wedding and streets of gold in 1977/78 , followed by andy statman and zev feldman 's jewish klezmer music in 1979 klezmer is easily identifiable by its characteristic expressive melodies , reminiscent of the human voice , complete with laughing and weeping a number of dreydlekh ( a yiddish word for ornament ( music ) ) , such as krekhts ( '' sobs '' ) are used to produce this style klezmer musicians heard and adapted traditional romanian music , which is reflected in the dance forms found throughout surviving klezmer music repertoire ( e.g the bible has several descriptions of orchestras and levites making music , but after the destruction of the second temple in 70 ce , many rabbis discouraged musical instruments however , the importance of merrymaking at weddings was not diminished , and musicians came forth to fill that niche , klezmorim the first klezmer known by name was yakobius ben yakobius , a player of the aulos in samaria in the 2nd century ce it is unlikely that they played music recognizable as klezmer today since the style and structure of klezmer as we know it today is thought to have come largely from 19th century bessarabia , where the bulk of today 's traditional repertoire was written klezmorim based much of their secular instrumental music upon the devotional vocal music of the synagogue , in particular hazzan music klezmorim often travelled and played with romani musicians ( '' lăutari '' ) , because they occupied similar social strata they had a great influence on each other musically and linguistically ( the extensive klezmer argot in yiddish includes some romani borrowings ) they sometimes played for christian churches and local aristocracy , and taught some italian classical violin virtuosos also , a shift towards brass and percussion happened when klezmorim were conscripted into military bands while traditional performances may have been on the decline , many jewish composers who had mainstream success , such as leonard bernstein and aaron copland , continued to be influenced by the klezmeric idioms heard during their youth ( as gustav mahler had been ) george gershwin was familiar with klezmer music , and the opening clarinet glissando of rhapsody in blue suggests this influence , although the composer did not compose klezmer directly at the same time , non-jewish composers were also turning to klezmer for a prolific source of fascinating thematic material dmitri shostakovich in particular admired klezmer music for embracing both the ecstasy and the despair of human life , and quoted several melodies in his chamber masterpieces , the piano quintet ( shostakovich ) ( 1940 ) , the piano trio no in 1985 , henry sapoznik and adrienne cooper founded klezkamp to teach klezmer and other yiddish music musicians began to track down older european klezmer , by listening to recordings , finding transcriptions , and making field recordings of the few klezmorim left in eastern europe in the 1990s , musicians from the san francisco bay area helped further interest in klezmer music by taking it into new territory the new orleans klezmer all-stars also formed in 1991 with a mixture of new orleans funk , jazz , and klezmer styles interest in klezmer has been sustained and supported by such well-known avant-garde jazz musicians as john zorn and don byron , who sometimes blend klezmer with jazz klezmer melodies have recently been incorporated into songs by third-wave ska band streetlight manifesto starting in 2008 , '' the other europeans '' project , funded by several eu cultural institutions , spent a year doing intensive field research in moldavia under the leadership of alan bern and scholar zev feldman clarinetists moshe berlin and avrum leib burstein are known exponents of the klezmer style in israel however , there were several times in history where this transmission broke down , including mass emigration , but especially the holocaust , which destroyed most of jewish life and culture in europe a few older klezmorim—such as leon schwartz , dave tarras , and german goldenshtayn—survived into the klezmer revival era and could recall some forgotten repertoire in the 21st century , klezmer is typically learned from '' fake books '' and transcriptions of old recordings , although the music was traditionally transmitted and learned by ear typically piano , accordion , or bass plays a duple oompah beat its name comes from the straight-legged , quick movements of the legs , reminiscent of the shears ( yiddish : sher ) of tailors skotshne ( '' hopping '' ) could be an instrumental display piece , but also a dance piece , like a more elaborate freylekhs in bulgaria , serbia , and macedonia , sometimes the paykler ( drummer ) also played in the tapan style , i.e ahavo rabboh means '' abounding love '' in hebrew , and refers to a prayer from the jewish services service ( shacharis ) it is also called the '' freygish '' , a yiddish term derived from the german '' phrygisch '' , or phrygian mode ( specifically , the phrygian dominant scale ) barcelona gipsy klezmer orchestra ( bgko )
