the purpose of any engine bell is to direct the exhaust of a rocket engine in one direction , generating thrust in the opposite direction ambient air pressure also imparts a small pressure against the exhaust , helping to keep it moving in the '' right '' direction as it exits the engine , outward from the main exhaust plume ) , the efficiency of the engine is reduced as the rocket travels because this escaping exhaust is no longer contributing to the thrust of the engine an aerospike rocket engine seeks to eliminate this loss of efficiency the spike forms one side of a '' virtual '' bell , with the other side being formed by the outside air the idea behind the aerospike design is that at low altitude the ambient pressure compresses the exhaust against the spike exhaust recirculation in the base zone of the spike can raise the pressure in that zone to nearly ambient as the vehicle climbs to higher altitudes , the air pressure holding the exhaust against the spike decreases , as does the drag in front of the vehicle in the linear aerospike the spike consists of a tapered wedge-shaped plate , with exhaust exiting on either side at the '' thick '' end the rs-2200 linear aerospike engine was derived from the xrs-2200 a new company , firefly aerospace , has replaced the aerospike engine with a conventional engine in the alpha 2.0 design in june 2017 , arca announced that they would fly their demonstrator3 rocket to space , also using a linear aerospike engine in september 2017 , arca announced that , after being delayed , their linear aerospike engine was ready to perform ground tests and flight tests on a demonstrator3 rocket on december 20 , 2019 , arca tested the las 25da aerospike steam rocket engine for the launch assist system
