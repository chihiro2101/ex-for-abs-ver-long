radio clocks synchronized to a terrestrial time signal can usually achieve an accuracy within a hundredth of a second relative to the time standard , generally limited by uncertainties and variability in radio propagation some timekeepers , particularly watches such as some casio wave ceptors which are more likely than desk clocks to be used when travelling , can synchronise to any one of several different time signals transmitted in different regions radio clocks depend on coded time signals from radio stations the stations vary in broadcast frequency , in geographic location , and in how the signal is modulated to identify the current time list of radio time signal stations bipm annual report on time activities – ftp : //ftp2.bipm.org/pub/tai/scale/timesignals/timesignals.pdf time signals , retrieved 2018 july 31 a number of manufacturers and retailers sell radio clocks that receive coded time signals from a radio station , which , in turn , derives the time from a true atomic clock their model gc-1000 '' most accurate clock '' received shortwave time signals from radio station wwv in fort collins , colorado radio controlled clock £19.95 clocks may have other features such as indoor thermometers and weather station functionality many modern tv sets and vcrs with ttx decoders can obtain accurate time from teletext and set the internal clock ; digital radio mondiale : drm is able to send a clock signal , but one not as precise as navigation satellite clock signals gps , galileo and glonass satellite navigation systems have one or more caesium , rubidium or hydrogen maser atomic clocks on each satellite , referenced to a clock or clocks on the ground these gps clocks combine time estimates from multiple satellite atomic clocks with error estimates maintained by a network of ground stations casio wave ceptor clock network speaking clock time from npl time transfer time synchronization in north america
