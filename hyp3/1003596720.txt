because of their long wavelengths , vlf radio waves can diffract around large obstacles and so are not blocked by mountain ranges , and can propagate as ground waves following the curvature of the earth and so are not limited by the horizon the earth is surrounded by a conductive layer of electrons and ions in the upper atmosphere at the bottom of the ionosphere called the d layer at 60–90 & nbsp ; km ( 37–56 & nbsp ; miles ) altitude , which reflects vlf radio waves vlf waves have very low path attenuation , 2–3 & nbsp ; db per 1,000 & nbsp ; km , with little of the '' fading '' experienced at higher frequencies therefore , vlf transmissions are very stable and reliable , and are used for long distance communication vlf waves can penetrate seawater to a depth of at least 10–40 & nbsp ; meters ( 30–130 & nbsp ; feet ) , depending on the frequency employed and the salinity of the water , so they are used to communicate with submarines vlf waves used to communicate with submarines have created an artificial bubble around the earth that can protect it from solar flares and coronal mass ejections ; this occurred through interaction with high-energy radiation particles a major practical drawback to the vlf band is that because of the length of the waves , full size resonant antennas ( half wave dipole or monopole antenna antennas ) can not be built because of their physical height vertical antennas must be used because vlf waves propagate in vertical polarization , but a quarter-wave vertical antenna at 30 & nbsp ; khz ( 10 & nbsp ; km wavelength ) would be high very high power transmitters ( ~1 & nbsp ; megawatt ) are required for long distance communication , so the efficiency of the antenna is an important factor high power transmitting antennas for vlf frequencies are very large wire antennas , up to several kilometers long due to the low radiation resistance , to minimize power dissipated in the ground these antennas require extremely low resistance ground ( earthing ) systems , consisting of radial networks of buried copper wires under the antenna to minimize dielectric losses in the soil , the ground conductors are buried shallowly , only a few inches in the ground , and the ground surface near the antenna is protected by copper ground screens at vlf the design of this coil is challenging ; it must have low resistance at the operating rf frequency , high , and must withstand the high voltage on the antenna end the large vlf antennas used for high power transmitters usually have bandwidths of only 50-100 & nbsp ; hertz , and when transmitting frequency shift keying ( fsk ) , the usual mode , the resonant frequency of the antenna must sometimes be dynamically shifted with the modulation , between the two fsk frequencies a recent alternative used in some military vlf transmitters is a circuit which dynamically shifts the antenna 's resonant frequency between the two output frequencies with the modulation this is a magnetic core inductor with a second control winding through which a dc current flows , which controls the inductance by magnetizing the core , changing its permeability so when the frequency of the transmitter is shifted between the ' 1 ' and ' 0 ' frequencies , the saturable reactor changes the inductance in the antenna resonant circuit to shift the antenna resonant frequency to follow the transmitter 's frequency so small inefficient receiving antennas can be used , and the low voltage signal from the antenna can simply be amplified by the receiver without introducing significant noise a typical am radio signal with a bandwidth of 10 & nbsp ; khz would occupy one third of the vlf band more significantly , it would be difficult to transmit any distance because it would require an antenna with 100 times the bandwidth of current vlf antennas , which due to the chu-harrington limit would be enormous in size in high power vlf transmitters , to increase the allowable data rate , a special form of fsk called minimum shift keying ( msk ) is used for example , a frequency of 9070 & nbsp ; hz might be used to indicate a ' 1 ' and the frequency 9020 & nbsp ; hz , 50 & nbsp ; hz lower , to indicate a ' 0 ' ; minimum-shift keying ( msk ) : a continuous phase version of fsk designed specifically for small bandwidths , this was adopted by naval vlf stations in the 1970s to increase the data rate and is now the standard mode used in military vlf transmitters in the usa , the time signal station wwvl began transmitting a 500 & nbsp ; w signal on 20 & nbsp ; khz in august & nbsp ; 1963 vlf transmitter cutler at cutler , maine which transmits on 24 & nbsp ; khz with 1.8 & nbsp ; mw operations tend to congregate around the frequencies 8.27 & nbsp ; khz , 6.47 & nbsp ; khz , 5.17 & nbsp ; khz , and 2.97 & nbsp ; khz longwave club of america radio waves below 22 khz vlf discussion group tomislav stimac , '' definition of frequency bands ( vlf , elf
