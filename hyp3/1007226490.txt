quorum sensing was first reported in 1970 , by kenneth nealson , terry platt , and j these bacteria did not synthesize luciferase—and therefore did not luminesce—in freshly inoculated culture but only after the bacterial population had increased significantly some of the best-known examples of quorum sensing come from studies of bacteria bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate certain phenotype expressions , which in turn , coordinate their behaviours some common phenotypes include biofilm formation , virulence factor expression , and motility certain bacteria are able to use quorum sensing to regulate bioluminescence , nitrogen fixation and spore both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria use quorum sensing , but there are some major differences in their mechanisms for the bacteria to use quorum sensing constitutively , they must possess three characteristics : to secrete a signaling molecule , an autoinducer , to detect the change in concentration of signaling molecules , and to regulate gene transcription as a response qs signaling molecules are usually secreted at a low level by individual bacteria at high cell density , the local concentration of signaling molecules may exceed its threshold level , and trigger changes in gene expression when gram-positive bacteria detect high concentration of aips in their environment , that happens by way of aips binding to a receptor to activate a kinase gram-negative bacteria produce n-acyl homoserine lactone ( ahl ) as their signaling molecule fischeri cells are free-living ( or planktonic ) , the autoinducer is at low concentration , and , thus , cells do not show luminescence as mentioned before , ahl are the quorum sensing molecules of gram-negative bacteria , which means curvibacter has a quorum sensing activity the most likely explanation is that the binding of 3-oxo-hsl and 3-hydroxy-hsl causes different conformational changes in the ahl receptors curr1 and curr2 on the other hand , this switch modifies its ability to colonize the epithelial cell surfaces of hydra vulgaris therefore , bacteria have less chance to evade the immune system and to colonize host tissues coli ) , cell division may be partially regulated by ai-2-mediated quorum sensing transcription of the lsr operon is also thought to be inhibited by dihydroxyacetone phosphate ( dhap ) through its competitive binding to lsrr when grown normally , ai-2 presence is transient however , they have a receptor that detects ahls from other bacteria and change their gene expression in accordance with the presence of other '' quorate '' populations of gram-negative bacteria sdia detects ahls produced by other species of bacteria including aeromonas hydrophila , hafnia alvei , and yersinia enterocolitica when ahl is detected , sdia regulates the rck operon on the salmonella virulence plasmid ( pefi-srgd-srga-srgb-rck-srgc ) and a single gene horizontal acquisition in the chromosome srge salmonella does not detect ahl when passing through the gastrointestinal tracts of several animal species , suggesting that the normal microbiota does not produce ahls therefore , salmonella appears to use sdia to detect the ahl production of other pathogens rather than the normal gut flora these bacteria can grow within a host without harming it until they reach a threshold concentration recent studies have discovered that anaerobiosis can significantly impact the major regulatory circuit of quorum sensing this important link between quorum sensing and anaerobiosis has a significant impact on the production of virulence factors of this organism it is hoped that the therapeutic enzymatic degradation of the signaling molecules will prevent the formation of such biofilms and possibly weaken established biofilms shows both quorum sensing and quorum quenching activity it produces ahls and also , it can degrade the ahl molecules as well all isolates produced the two principal ahls , n-butanoylhomoserine lactone ( c4-hsl ) and n-hexanoyl homoserine lactone ( c6-hsl ) certain bacteria can produce enzymes called lactonases that can target and inactivate ahls mbtl is a compound that has been shown to inhibit quorum sensing and decrease the amount of cell death by a significant amount additionally , researchers are also examining the role of natural compounds ( such as caffeine ) as potential quorum sensing inhibitors looking towards developing new strategies based on plant-associated microbiomes , the aim of further study is to improve the quantity and quality of the food supply quorum quenching is the process of preventing quorum sensing by disrupting signalling this technique has also been translated to agriculture , to restrict the spread of pathogenic bacteria that use quorum sensing in plants eventually , the ants in this nest will sense that the rate at which they encounter other ants has exceeded a particular threshold , indicating that the quorum number has been reached ad-hoc wireless networks can also benefit from quorum sensing , by allowing the system to detect and respond to network conditions
