in johann bayer 's celestial atlas uranometria , published in 1603 , he named the smaller cloud , nubecula minor between 1893 and 1906 , under the direction of solon bailey , the telescope at this site was used to survey photographically both the large and small magellanic clouds henrietta swan leavitt , an astronomer at the harvard college observatory , used the plates from arequipa to study the variations in relative luminosity of stars in the smc leavitt reaized that since all the stars in the smc are roughly the same distance from earth , this result implied that there is similar relationship between period and absolute brightness there is a bridge of gas connecting the small magellanic cloud with the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , which is evidence of tidal interaction between the galaxies in 2017 , using dark energy survey plus maglites data , a stellar over-density associated with the small magellanic cloud was discovered , which is probably the result of interactions between smc and lmc the small magellanic cloud contains a large and active population of x-ray binary recent star formation has led to a large population of massive stars and high-mass x-ray binaries ( hmxbs ) which are the relics of the short-lived upper end of the initial mass function the fourth uhuru catalog lists an early x-ray source within the constellation tucana : 4u 0115-73 ( 3u 0115-73 , 2a 0116-737 , smc x-1 ) uhuru observed the smc on january 1 , 12 , 13 , 16 , and 17 , 1971 , and detected one source located at 01149-7342 , which was then designated smc x-1 small magellanic cloud in fiction large magellanic cloud magellanic clouds objects within the small magellanic cloud : ngc 265 ngc 290 ngc 346 ngc 602
