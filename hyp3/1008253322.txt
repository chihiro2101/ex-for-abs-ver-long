wikipedia has practically unlimited storage space ; however , long articles may be more difficult to read , navigate , and comprehend an article longer than one or two pages when printed should be divided into sections to ease navigation ( see wikipedia : manual of style and wikipedia : layout for guidance ) for most long articles , division into sections is natural anyway readers of the mobile version of wikipedia can be helped by ensuring that sections are not so long or so numerous as to impede navigation at 10,000 words ( 50 & nbsp ; kb and above ) it may be beneficial to move some sections to other articles and replace them with summaries per wikipedia : summary style â€“ see a rule of thumb below while expert readers of such articles may accept complexity and length provided the article is well written , the general reader requires clarity and conciseness readable prose is the main body of the text , excluding material such as footnotes and reference sections ( '' see also '' , '' external links '' , bibliography , etc it may be used for an article currently being looked at by selecting the view history tab for the page , then page statistics from the line near the top headed external tools if there is no '' natural '' way to split or reduce a long list or table , it may be best to leave it intact , and a decision made to either keep it embedded in the main article or split it off into a stand-alone page some large articles exist for topics that require depth and detail , but typically articles of such size are split into two or more smaller articles for notes on unrelated problems that various web browsers have with mediawiki sites , and for a list of alternative browsers you can download , see wikipedia : browser notes the maximum limit for wikipedia is set by the mediawiki software default article size limit , 2048 kibibytes ( specifically , 2,097,152 bytes ) when you split a section from a long article into an independent article , you should leave a short summary of the material that is removed along with a pointer to the independent article ) a note should also be made in the edit summary of the source article , '' split content to article name '' , to protect against the article subsequently being deleted and the history of the new page eradicated if a section of an article is a magnet for unhelpful contributions ( such as the '' external links '' section or trivia sections ) , be aware that while moving it to another article may help to clean up the main article , it creates a new article that consists entirely of a section for unwanted contributions many articles on wikipedia may be longer than 32 & nbsp ; kb on a permanent basis , so older browsers will continue to have occasional problems with long articles often you can edit the article one section at a time by using the '' edit '' links you see next to each header in the article
