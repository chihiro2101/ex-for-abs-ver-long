the names somatotropin ( sth ) or somatotropic hormone refer to the growth hormone produced naturally in animals and extracted from carcasses the main growth hormone produced by recombinant dna technology has the approved generic name ( inn ) somatropin and the brand name humatrope , and is properly abbreviated rhgh in the scientific literature the major isoform of the human growth hormone is a protein of 191 amino acids and a molecular weight of 22,124 daltons the structure includes four helices necessary for functional interaction with the gh receptor despite marked structural similarities between growth hormone from different species , only human and old world monkey growth hormones have significant effects on the human growth hormone receptor several molecule isoforms of gh exist in the pituitary gland and are released to blood furthermore , these variants circulate partially bound to a protein ( growth hormone-binding protein , ghbp ) , which is the truncated part of the growth hormone receptor , and an acid-labile subunit ( als ) secretion of growth hormone ( gh ) in the pituitary is regulated by the neurosecretion nuclei of the hypothalamus these cells release the peptides growth hormone-releasing hormone ( ghrh or somatocrinin ) and somatostatin ( ghih or somatostatin ) into the hypophyseal portal venous blood surrounding the pituitary gh release in the pituitary is primarily determined by the balance of these two peptides , which in turn is affected by many physiological stimulators ( e.g nearly fifty percent of gh secretion occurs during the third and fourth nrem sleep stages the plasma concentration of gh during these peaks may range from 5 to even 45 & nbsp ; ng/ml additional analysis of the pulsatile profile of gh described in all cases less than 1 & nbsp ; ng/ml for basal levels while maximum peaks were situated around 10-20 & nbsp ; ng/ml a number of factors are known to affect gh secretion , such as age , sex , diet , exercise , stress , and other hormones young adolescents secrete gh at the rate of about 700 μg/day , while healthy adults secrete gh at the rate of about 400 μg/day gh also stimulates , through the jak-stat signaling pathway , the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 ( igf-1 , formerly known as somatomedin c ) , a hormone homologous to proinsulin additional igf-1 is generated within target tissues , making it what appears to be both an endocrine and an autocrine/paracrine hormone alterations in somatomedin can result in growth hormone deficiency with two known mechanisms ; failure of tissues to respond to somatomedin , or failure of the liver to produce somatomedin major manifestations of gh deficiency in children are growth failure , the development of a short stature , and delayed sexual maturity treatment with exogenous gh is indicated only in limited circumstances , and needs regular monitoring due to the frequency and severity of side-effects gh is used as replacement therapy in adults with gh deficiency of either childhood-onset or adult-onset ( usually as a result of an acquired pituitary tumor ) gh can be used to treat conditions that produce short stature but are not related to deficiencies in gh however , results are not as dramatic when compared to short stature that is solely attributable to deficiency of gh higher ( '' pharmacologic '' ) doses are required to produce significant acceleration of growth in these conditions , producing blood levels well above normal ( '' physiologic '' ) the use of gh in poultry farming is illegal in the united states genentech pioneered the first use of recombinant human growth hormone for human therapy in 1981 prior to its production by recombinant dna technology , growth hormone used to treat deficiencies was extracted from the pituitary glands of cadavers there was a significant increase in urinary excretion of aldosterone during both periods of administration of growth hormone impairment of the glucose tolerance curve was evident after 10 days of administration of the human growth hormone
