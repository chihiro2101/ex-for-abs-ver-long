when a designer designs something – whether a house , computer program , or lamp – they must make many decisions about how to solve problems a single problem is documented with its typical place ( the syntax ) , and use ( the grammar ) with the most common and recognized good solution seen in the wild , like the examples seen in dictionary each pattern has a name , a descriptive entry , and some cross-references , much like a dictionary entry a documented pattern should explain why that solution is good in the pattern 's contexts patterns might be invented or found and studied , such as the naturally occurring patterns of design that characterize human environments regarding the theoretical background of patterns and the practical implementation of pattern methods in research and teaching like all languages , a pattern language has vocabulary , syntax , and grammar – but a pattern language applies to some complex activity other than communication in pattern languages for design , the parts break down in this way : the language description – the vocabulary – is a collection of named , described solutions to problems in a field of interest the solution includes grammar that describes how the solution solves a problem or produces a benefit perhaps that part of the design can be left empty to save money or other resources ; if people do not need to wait to enter a room , a simple doorway can replace a waiting room in christopher alexander 's book a pattern language , the patterns are in decreasing order by size , with a separate alphabetic index this simplifies the design work because designers can start the process from any part of the problem they understand and work toward the unknown parts at the same time , if the pattern language has worked well for many projects , there is reason to believe that even a designer who does not completely understand the design problem at first will complete the design process , and the result will be usable christopher alexander 's work describes a process of decomposition , in which the designer has a problem ( perhaps a commercial assignment ) , selects a solution , then discovers new , smaller problems resulting from the larger solution eventually all of the remaining design problems are small enough or routine enough to be solved by improvisation by the builders , and the '' design '' is done in the language , therefore , each pattern has to indicate its relationships to other patterns and to the language as a whole the most difficult part of having an outside expert apply a pattern language is in fact to get a reliable , complete list of the problems to be solved the desire to empower users of architecture was , in fact , what led alexander to undertake a pattern language project for architecture in the first place for instance , alexander 's pattern '' a place to wait '' addresses bus stops in the same way as waiting rooms in a surgery , while still proposing helpful and constructive solutions still , the problems and solutions described in a pattern can vary in their level of abstraction and generality on the one side , and specificity on the other side however , even a very abstract pattern will usually contain examples that are , by nature , absolutely concrete and specific alexander gives each pattern a rating by zero , one or two stars , indicating how well they are proven in real-world examples alexander sees the low-scale artifacts as constructive elements of the large-scale world , so they can be connected to a hierarchic network often these problems arise from a conflict of different interests or '' forces '' though quite unspecific in its context , the forces in the '' secondary activity '' pattern are very similar to those in '' wireless telephone '' thus , the competing forces can be seen as part of the essence of a design concept expressed in a pattern some examples from alexander 's works are window place ( helps define where windows should go in a room ) and a place to wait ( helps define the characteristics of bus stops and hospital waiting rooms , for example ) a pattern language , as conceived by alexander , contains links from one pattern to another , so when trying to apply one pattern in a project , a designer is pushed to other patterns that are considered helpful in its context the following definitions of '' pattern '' and '' pattern language '' are paraphrased from a pattern language : '' a pattern is a careful description of a perennial solution to a recurring problem within a building context , describing one of the configurations that brings life to a building '' a pattern language is a network of patterns that call upon one another christopher alexander 's idea has been adopted in other disciplines , often much more heavily than the original pattern ( architecture ) as depicted in the book a pattern language
