succinylcholine chloride injection indicated , in addition to general anesthesia , to facilitate tracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation its medical uses are limited to short-term muscle relaxation in anesthesia and intensive care , usually for facilitation of endotracheal intubation it may be better than rocuronium in people without contraindications due to its faster onset of action and shorter duration of action suxamethonium is also commonly used as the sole muscle relaxant during electroconvulsive therapy , favoured for its short duration of action suxamethonium is quickly degraded by plasma butyrylcholinesterase and the duration of effect is usually in the range of a few minutes in people with neuromuscular disease or burns , an injection of suxamethonium can lead to a large release of potassium from skeletal muscles , potentially resulting in cardiac arrest the side effect of high blood potassium may occur because the acetylcholine receptor is propped open , allowing continued flow of potassium ions into the extracellular fluid high blood potassium does not generally result in adverse effects below a concentration of 6.5 to 7 meq per liter therefore , the increase in serum potassium level is usually not catastrophic in otherwise healthy patients severely high blood levels of potassium will cause changes in cardiac electrophysiology , which , if severe , can result in asystole malignant hyperthermia ( mh ) from suxamethonium administration can result in a drastic and uncontrolled increase in skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism however plasma cholinesterase activity is reduced in some people due to either genetic variation or acquired conditions , which results in a prolonged duration of neuromuscular block such genes will result in a longer duration of action of the drug , ranging from 20 minutes up to several hours suxamethonium has a longer duration of effect than acetylcholine , and is not hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase
