the only account of the life of zhuangzi is a brief sketch in chapter 63 of sima qian 's records of the grand historian , and most of the information it contains seems to have simply been drawn from anecdotes in the zhuangzi itself in sima 's biography , he is described as a minor official from the town of meng ( in modern anhui ) in the state of song , living in the time of king hui of wei and king xuan of qi ( late 4th century bc ) sima qian writes : : :chuang-tze had made himself well acquainted with all the literature of his time , but preferred the views of laozi ; and ranked himself among his followers , so that of the more than ten myriads of characters contained in his published writings the greater part are occupied with metaphorical illustrations of lao 's doctrines he made '' the old fisherman , '' '' the robber chih , '' and '' the cutting open satchels , '' to satirize and expose the disciples of confucius , and clearly exhibit the sentiments of lao : :king wei of chu , having heard of the ability of chuang chau , sent messengers with large gifts to bring him to his court , and promising also that he would make him his chief minister chuang-tze , however , only laughed and said to them , '' a thousand ounces of silver are a great gain to me ; and to be a high noble and minister is a most honorable position '' the validity of his existence has been questioned by russell kirkland , who writes : according to modern understandings of chinese tradition , the text known as the chuang-tzu was the production of a 'taoist ' thinker of ancient china named chuang chou/zhuang zhou regarding the identity of the original person named chuang chou/zhuangzi , there is no reliable historical data at all furthermore , the han shu '' yiwenzhi '' ( monograph on literature ) lists a text zhuangzi , showing that a text with this title existed no later than the early 1st century ad , again pre-dating guo xiang by centuries this work , in its current shape consisting of 33 chapters , is traditionally divided into three parts : the first , known as the '' inner chapters '' , consists of the first seven chapters ; the second , known as the '' outer chapters '' , consist of the next 15 chapters ; the last , known as the '' mixed chapters '' , consist of the remaining 11 chapters the meaning of these three names is disputed : according to guo xiang , the '' inner chapters '' were written by zhuangzi , the '' outer chapters '' written by his disciples , and the '' mixed chapters '' by other hands ; the other interpretation is that the names refer to the origin of the titles of the chaptersâ€”the '' inner chapters '' take their titles from phrases inside the chapter , the '' outer chapters '' from the opening words of the chapters , and the '' mixed chapters '' from a mixture of these two sources on the one side , as martin palmer points out in the introduction to his translation , two of the three chapters sima qian cited in his biography of zhuangzi , come from the '' outer chapters '' and the third from the '' mixed chapters '' '' neither of these are allowed as authentic chuang tzu chapters by certain purists , yet they breathe the very spirit of chuang tzu just as much as , for example , the famous 'butterfly passage ' of chapter 2 graham and other critics have subjected the text to a stylistic analysis and identified four strains of thought in the book : a ) the ideas of zhuangzi or his disciples ; b ) a '' primitivist '' strain of thinking similar to laozi in chapters 8-10 and the first half of chapter 11 ; c ) a strain very strongly represented in chapters 28-31 which is attributed to the philosophy of yang chu ; and d ) a fourth strain which may be related to the philosophical school of huang-lao chiu-yu bugs are born from mou-jui bugs and mou-jui bugs are born from rot grubs and rot grubs are born from sheep 's groom
