desmostylians were large , fully aquatic quadrupeds with massive limbs and short tails the cusps of the premolars and molars are composed of densely packed cylinders of thick enamel , giving the order its name ( '' bundle of columns '' ) the cheek teeth are brachydont and bunodont in primitive genera , but hypsodont in later genera such as desmostylus , which has many supernumerary cusps their dental and skeletal forms suggest that desmostylians were aquatic herbivores dependent on littoral habitats based on a comparison of trunk and limb proportions , concluded that desmostylians were more terrestrial than aquatic and clearly fore limb-dominated swimmers , hence they were more similar to '' sea bears '' than '' sea sloths '' ( as proposed by other researchers in particular , later species like neoparadoxia are more specialised than previous forms , suggesting increased divergence to compete with sirenians , and sirenian diversity appears to increase with desmostylian decline the type species desmostylus hesperus was originally classified from a few teeth and vertebrae as a sirenian by , but doubts arose a decade later when more complete fossils were discovered in japan because desmostylians were originally known only from skull fragments , teeth , and bits of other bones , general agreement was that they had had flippers and a fin-like tail photos : new species of extinct marine mammal identified from unalaska fossils , alaska dispatch news , mike dunham , october 7 , 2015 douglas emlong 's 1971 discovery of the new genus behemotops from oregon showed that early desmostylians had more proboscidean-like teeth and jaws than later ones
