he was born at milgate house , bearsted , kent , not too long before 17 january 1573/4 he was the son of sir thomas fludd , a high-ranking governmental official ( queen elizabeth i 's treasurer for war in europe ) , and member of parliament fludd may have encountered gwinne , or his writing , during his time at oxford , providing an additional influence for his later medical philosophy and practice between 1598 and 1604 , fludd studied medicine , chemistry and hermeticism on the european mainland following his graduation upon returning to england in 1604 , fludd matriculated to christ church , oxford fludd defended three theses following these texts , and on 14 may 1605 , fludd made his supplication after graduating from christ church , fludd moved to london , settling in fenchurch street , and making repeated attempts to enter the college of physicians fludd encountered problems with the college examiners , both because of his unconcealed contempt for traditional medical authorities ( he had adopted the views of paracelsus ) , and because of his attitude to authority—especially those of the ancients like galen he became a prosperous london doctor , serving as censor of the college four times ( 1618 , 1627 , 1633 , and 1634 ) to what extent fludd may have actually influenced harvey is still debated , in the context that harvey 's discovery is hard to date precisely debus , robert fludd and the circulation of the blood , j hist med allied sci ( 1961 ) xvi ( 4 ) : 374-393 while he followed paracelsus in his medical views rather than the ancient authorities , he was also a believer that real wisdom was to be found in the writings of natural magicians his view of these mystical authorities was inclined towards the great mathematicians , and he believed , like pythagoras and his followers , that numbers contained access to great hidden secrets much of fludd 's writing , and his pathology of disease , centered around the sympathies found in nature between man , the terrestrial earth , and the divine while paracelsian in nature , fludd 's own theory on the origin of all things posited that , instead of the tria prima , all species and things stemmed from first , dark chaos , then divine light which acted upon the chaos , which finally brought forth the waters fludd was heavily reliant on scripture ; in the bible , the number three represented the principium formarum , or the original form the divine light ( the second of fludd ’ s primary principles ) was the '' active agent '' responsible for creation the sun conveyed spirit to the earth through its rays , which circulated in and about the earth giving it life this was an application of the sympathies and parallels provided to all of god ’ s creation by fludd ’ s tripartite theory of matter the blood was central to fludd 's conception of the relationship between the microcosm and macrocosm ; the blood and the spirit it circulated interacted directly with the spirit conveyed to the macrocosm fludd extended this interaction to his conception of disease : the movement of spirit between the macrocosm and microcosm could be corrupted and invade the microcosm as disease like paracelsus , fludd conceived of disease as an external invader , rather than a complexional imbalance fludd was not a member of the rosicrucians , as often alleged , but he defended their thoughts as expressed in numerous manifestos and pamphlets in the third book fludd contends that those filled with the spirit of christ may rise before his second coming it is now seriously doubted that any formal organisation identifiable as the '' brothers of the rose cross '' ( rosicrucians ) ever actually existed in any extant form between 1607 and 1616 , two anonymous rosicrucian manifestos were published by some anonymous person or group , first in germany and later throughout europe the second manifesto had decidedly anti-catholic views which were popular at the time of the counter reformation these manifestos were re-issued several times , and were both supported and countered by numerous pamphlets from anonymous authors : about 400 manuscripts and books were published on the subject between 1614 and 1620 others intellectuals and authors later claimed to have published rosicrucian documents in order to ridicule their views robert fludd und die reform der bildung im 17 he finds convincing the argument in huffman 's book that fludd was not a rosicrucian but was '' a leading advocate of renaissance christian neo-platonism johannes rösche , robert fludd guariento , luca ( 2016 ) life , friends , and associations of robert fludd : a revised account robert fludd biography at levity fludd 's magnum opus , 'utriusque cosmi maioris salicet et minoris metaphysica
