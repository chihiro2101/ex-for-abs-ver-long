macrophages that reside in adult healthy tissues either derive from circulating monocytes or are established before birth and then maintained during adult life independently of monocytes by contrast , most of the macrophages that accumulate at diseased sites typically derive from circulating monocytes when a monocyte enters damaged tissue through the endothelium of a blood vessel , a process known as leukocyte extravasation , it undergoes a series of changes to become a macrophage monocytes are attracted to a damaged site by chemical substances through chemotaxis , triggered by a range of stimuli including damaged cells , pathogens and cytokines released by macrophages already at the site unlike short-lived neutrophils , macrophages survive longer in the body , up to several months file : phagocytosis zp.svg thumb right 400px steps of a macrophage ingesting a pathogen : a ingestion through phagocytosis , a phagosome is formed b the fusion of lysosomes with the phagosome creates a phagolysosome ; the pathogen is broken down by enzymes c macrophages are professional phagocytes and are highly specialized in removal of dying or dead cells and cellular debris the neutrophils are at first attracted to a site , where they perform their function and die , before they are phagocytized by the macrophages when at the site , the first wave of neutrophils , after the process of aging and after the first 48 hours , stimulate the appearance of the macrophages whereby these macrophages will then ingest the aged neutrophils however , some bacteria , such as mycobacterium tuberculosis , have become resistant to these methods of digestion typhoidal salmonellae induce their own phagocytosis by host macrophages in vivo , and inhibit digestion by lysosomal action , thereby using macrophages for their own replication and causing macrophage apoptosis macrophages can digest more than 100 bacteria before they finally die due to their own digestive compounds along with dendritic cells , they are foremost among the cells that present antigens , a crucial role in initiating an immune response at the same time , they carry receptors for lymphokines that allow them to be '' activated '' into single-minded pursuit of microbes and tumour cells eventually , the antigen presentation results in the production of antibody that attach to the antigens of pathogens , making them easier for macrophages to adhere to with their cell membrane and phagocytose tumor-associated macrophages are mainly of the m2 phenotype , and seem to actively promote tumor growth these mediator molecules create a pro-inflammatory response that in return produce pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 and tnf m2 macrophages are divided into four major types based on their roles : m2a , m2b , m2c , and m2d how m2 phenotypes are determined is still up for discussion but studies have shown that their environment allows them to adjust to whichever phenotype is most appropriate to efficiently heal the wound they produce vascular epithelial growth factor-a and tgf-β1 there is a phenotype shift from m1 to m2 macrophages in acute wounds , however this shift is impaired for chronic wounds this dysregulation results in insufficient m2 macrophages and its corresponding growth factors that aid in wound repair with a lack of these growth factors/anti-inflammatory cytokines and an overabundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines from m1 macrophages chronic wounds are unable to heal in a timely manner the initial wave is a phagocytic population that comes along during periods of increased muscle use that are sufficient to cause muscle membrane lysis and membrane inflammation , which can enter and degrade the contents of injured muscle fibers the spleen contains half the body 's monocytes in reserve ready to be deployed to injured tissue macrophages also secrete a number of factors such as growth factors and other cytokines , especially during the third and fourth post-wound days macrophages may also restrain the contraction phase by secreting these factors , macrophages contribute to pushing the wound healing process into the next phase scientists have elucidated that as well as eating up material debris , macrophages are involved in the typical limb regeneration in the salamander they found that removing the macrophages from a salamander resulted in failure of limb regeneration and a scarring response melanophages are a subset of tissue-resident macrophages able to absorb pigment , either native to the organism or exogenous ( such as tattoos ) , from extracellular space macrophages are better able to resist infection by hiv-1 than cd4+ t cells , although susceptibility to hiv infection differs among macrophage subtypes inflammatory compounds such as tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) -alpha released by the macrophages activate the gene switch nf-κb because macrophages can regulate tumor progression , therapeutic strategies to reduce the number of these cells , or to manipulate their phenotypes , are currently being tested in cancer patients macrophages and intestinal macrophages have high plasticity causing their phenotype to be altered by their environments whereas tissue macrophages release various inflammatory cytokines , such as il-1 , il-6 and tnf-α , intestinal macrophages do not produce or secrete inflammatory cytokines there has yet to be a determined mechanism for the alteration of the intestinal macrophages by recruitment of new monocytes or changes in the already present intestinal macrophages
