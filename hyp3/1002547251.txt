one monkey named helen could be considered the '' star monkey in visual research '' because she was the original blindsight subject furthermore , under certain experimental conditions , she could detect a variety of visual stimuli , such as the presence and location of objects , as well as shape , pattern , orientation , motion , and color subjects who had suffered damage to their visual cortices due to accidents or strokes reported partial or total blindness in spite of this , when they were prompted they could '' guess '' with above-average accuracy about the presence and details of objects , much like the animal subjects , and they could even catch objects that were tossed at them furthermore , blindsight subjects rarely express the amazement about their abilities that sighted people would expect them to express patients with blindsight have damage to the system that produces visual perception ( the visual cortex of the brain and some of the nerve fibers that bring information to it from the eyes ) rather than to the underlying brain system controlling eye movements blindsight patients show awareness of single visual features , such as edges and motion , but can not gain a holistic visual percept this suggests that perceptual awareness is modular and that—in sighted individuals—there is a '' binding process that unifies all information into a whole percept '' , which is interrupted in patients with such conditions as blindsight and visual agnosia therefore , object identification and object recognition are thought to be separate processes and occur in different areas of the brain , working independently from one another research has shown that visual stimuli with the single visual features of sharp borders , sharp onset/offset times , motion , and low spatial frequency contribute to , but are not strictly necessary for , an object 's salience in blindsight another explanation for the phenomenon of blindsight is that even though the majority of a person 's visual cortex may be damaged , tiny islands of functioning tissue remain these islands are n't large enough to provide conscious perception , but nevertheless enough for some unconscious visual perception a third theory is that the information required to determine the distance to and velocity of an object in object space is determined by the lateral geniculate nucleus before the information is projected to the visual cortex the monkeys were placed in front of a monitor and taught to indicate whether a stationary object or nothing was present in their visual field when a tone was played the monkeys performed very similar to human participants and were unable to perceive the presence of stationary objects outside of their visual field another 1995 study by the same group sought to prove that monkeys could also be conscious of movement in their deficit visual field despite not being consciously aware of the presence of an object there to do this , researchers used another standard test for humans which was similar to the previous study except moving objects were presented in the deficit visual field this showed that the monkey 's ability to detect movement is separate from their ability to consciously detect an object in their deficit visual field , and gave further evidence for the claim that damage to the striate cortex plays a large role in causing the disorder several years later , another study compared and contrasted the data collected from monkeys and that of a specific human patient with blindsight , gy in the monkeys , the striate cortex of the left hemisphere was surgically removed this ability to detect stimuli that the observer is not conscious of can extend to discrimination of the type of stimulus ( for example , whether an ' x ' or ' o ' has been presented in the blind field ) he was able to misstate , as requested , in his left visual field ( with normal conscious vision ) ; but he tended to fail in the task—to state the location correctly—when the stimulus was in his blindsight ( right ) visual field the results of db 's guesses showed that db was able to determine shape and detect movement at some unconscious level , despite not being visually aware of this but , in a newer study evidence showed that if the damage to the visual cortex occurs in areas above the primary visual cortex the conscious awareness of visual stimuli itself is not damaged so even when damage occurs in the area necessary for conscious awareness of visual information , other functions of the processing of these visual percepts are still available to the individual the subjects of the study were two patients who suffered from hemianopsia—blindness in more than half of their visual field but , regardless of the dots ' color the subjects could not tell when they were in motion or not when the white background and the dots were of similar brightness kentridge , heywood , and weiskrantz used the phenomenon of blindsight to investigate the connection between visual attention and visual awareness they wanted to see if their subject—who exhibited blindsight in other studies —could react more quickly when his/her attention was cued without the ability to be visually aware of it destruction of the primary visual cortex leads to blindness in the part of the visual field that corresponds to the damaged cortical representation people with damage to v1 report no conscious vision , no visual imagery , and no visual images in their dreams injury to the primary visual cortex , including lesions and other trauma , leads to the loss of visual experience in a study conducted in primates , after partial ablation of area v1 , areas v2 and v3 were still excited by visual stimulus
