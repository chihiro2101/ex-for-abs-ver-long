the mistle thrush was first described by carl linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of systema naturae under its current scientific name turdus is the latin for '' thrush '' , and viscivorus , '' mistletoe eater '' , comes from viscum '' mistletoe '' and vorare , '' to devour '' the bird 's liking for mistletoe berries is also indicated by its english name , '' mistle '' being an old name for the plant merula ) which are descended from ancestors that had colonised the caribbean islands from africa and subsequently reached europe from there tauricus , but this is not considered to be a valid form mistle thrush fossils have been found in pleistocene deposits from poland and sicily the mistle thrush is the largest thrush native to europe the long tail has white tips on the outer feathers , and the underwing coverts are white the eyes are dark brown and the bill is blackish with a yellowish base to the lower mandible birds of intermediate appearance are seen west of the ob river where the range overlaps with viscivorus deichleri resembles bonapartei in appearance , but is closer in size to the nominate viscivorus , although it has a more slender bill adults have a full moult after breeding , beginning between late may and the end of june , and completed by early october the male mistle thrush has a loud melodious song with fluted whistles , sounding like chewee-trewuu & nbsp ; the tone resembles that of the song thrush or blackbird , but compared to its relatives the mistle thrush 's repertoire is less varied and the delivery is slower the song is , however , much louder , often audible up to 2 & nbsp ; km ( 2,000 & nbsp ; yd ) away the song is given from a treetop or other elevated position mainly from november to early june the male is most vocal in the early morning , and its tendency to sing after , and sometimes during , wet and windy weather led to the old name '' stormcock '' it is often likened to the sound of a football rattle , a form of musical ratchet the mistle thrush breeds in much of europe and temperate asia , although it is absent from the treeless far north , and its range becomes discontinuous in southeast europe , turkey and the middle east the mistle thrush is a partial migrant : birds from the north and east of the range wintering in the milder areas of europe and north africa in the himalayas , the breeding population moves to nearby lower-altitude sites in winter return migration starts mainly from late march , although it can be a month earlier in the middle east , and northern breeders may not arrive back on their territories until late april or early may in the winter 2017/2018 the first record of a mistle thrush for north america was at miramichi in new brunswick more open habitats , such as agricultural land , moors and grassy hills , are extensively used in winter or on migration in germany and elsewhere in central europe , it was found only in coniferous forest until the mid-1920s when its range rapidly expanded , first into farmland , and then to suburbs and urban parks in areas of intensive farming , such as eastern england , arable land has in turn largely been abandoned in favour of built-up areas with their greater variety of green habitats perhaps the most notable find of the 118th christmas bird count in canada was a single vagrant mistle thrush found in miramichi , new brunswick the discovery attracted many birders from canada and the united states ; sightings continued from early december 2017 through late march 2018 it is not uncommon for up to 50 thrushes to feed together at that time of year territories are larger in woods than in farmland the nest is usually built in a tree in the fork of a branch or against the trunk , although hedges , ledges on buildings and cliff faces may also be used the common chaffinch often nests close to a mistle thrush , the vigilance of the chaffinch and the aggressive behaviour of the thrush benefiting both species it forages within its breeding habitat and in open fields , sometimes sharing these feeding areas with redwings or fieldfares the mistle thrush is not normally a host of the common cuckoo , a brood parasite the mistle thrush has an extensive distribution in europe and western asia , and its european breeding population is estimated at 9â€“22.2 & nbsp ; million birds '' holm thrush '' , '' hollin cock '' and '' holm cock '' are based on obsolete names for the holly tree , which may be defended by the thrush in winter for its berries
