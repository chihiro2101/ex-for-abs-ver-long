laboratories used for scientific research take many forms because of the differing requirements of specialists in the various fields of science and engineering a physics laboratory might contain a particle accelerator or vacuum chamber , while a metallurgy laboratory could have apparatus for casting or refining metals or for testing their strength a chemist or biology might use a wet laboratory , while a psychology laboratory might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior in some laboratories , such as those commonly used by computer scientists , computers ( sometimes supercomputers ) are used for either simulations or the analysis of data scientists in other fields will use still other types of laboratories one distinctive feature of work in open labs is phenomena of translation , driven by the different backgrounds and levels of expertise of the people involved later : one equipped for carrying out scientific experiments or procedures , esp for the purposes of research , teaching , or analysis ; ( also ) one in which chemicals or drugs are manufactured '' the emergence of big science during world war ii increased the size of laboratories and scientific equipment , introducing particle accelerators and similar devices the earliest laboratory according to the present evidence is a home laboratory of pythagoras of samos , the well-known greek philosopher and scientist a 16th century underground alchemical laboratory was accidentally discovered in the year 2002 the title of laboratory is also used for certain other facilities where the processes or equipment used are similar to those in scientific laboratories laboratory hazards might include poisons ; infectious agents ; flammable , explosive , or radioactive materials ; moving machinery ; extreme temperatures ; lasers , strong magnetic fields or high voltage under this standard , a laboratory is required to produce a chemical hygiene plan ( chp ) which addresses the specific hazards found in its location , and its approach to them work is divided , not only between different jobs of the laboratory such as the researchers , engineers and technicians , but also in terms of autonomy ( should the work be individual or in groups ) from the 1950s , the laboratory has evolved from being an educational tool used by teachers to attract the top students into research , into an organizational model allowing a high level of scientific productivity the main subject of the study revolved around the relationship between the staff of a laboratory ( researchers , administrators , receptionists , technicians , etc the degree of entitlement , which is also referred to as a staff 's rights , affects social interaction between staff in summary , differences in attitude among members of the laboratory are explained by social organization : a person 's attitudes are intimately related to the role they have in an organization
