serious thought was given to improving the river from 1691 , but disagreements between groups from doncaster , rotherham and sheffield prevented progress the dearne and dove canal was also authorised in 1793 , from swinton to barnsley , and was again under don navigation control , since most of the shareholders were also shareholders in the don they bought out the dearne and dove canal in 1846 , and acquired the sheffield canal from the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway in 1848 , which , as the sheffield and lincolnshire junction railway , a predecessor and constituent company , had bought it in 1846 they then amalgamated with the south yorkshire , doncaster and goole railway in 1850 , to become the south yorkshire railway and river dun company with the manchester ship canal under construction , and other large canals being proposed , a committee was formed to investigate a new canal from sheffield to the sea t & c hawksley , assisted by james abernethy , were asked to report on whether a canal from sheffield suitable for medium-sized coasters could be built , to the ouse , the trent or the humber their report , presented in october 1888 , suggested that the existing locks on the route from sheffield to keadby were inadequate , but that the waterway could be upgraded to take 300- to 500-ton boats by building new locks alongside the old , without disrupting traffic the estimated cost of this work , which included a new canal from tinsley to sheffield , but did not include buying the canals from the railway company , was put at £1 & nbsp ; million the sheffield and south yorkshire canal company limited was formed in november 1888 , with a capital of £30,000 , to promote this new venture and obtain the necessary act of parliament the new company obtained an act of parliament on 26 august 1889 , creating the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation company , which was authorised to raise £1.5 & nbsp ; million and to purchase the four canals either by negotiation , or by compulsory purchase if after nine months negotiations with the railway company had failed to reach an agreement they could also improve the canals they bought , or build new ones , and could also act as inland carriers the rest could be paid in shares in the new company , which would give the railway places on the board unless the canal company bought all of the shares back they were also faced with the prospect of funding their half of the new junction canal , to provide the connection with the aire and calder navigation today the system is open to navigation throughout the main line , the stainforth and keadby and new junction canals , and is mostly used for leisure boating a canal restoration group is also seeking the re-opening of the dearne and dove canal , has performed some restoration work at elsecar and commissioned an engineer 's report into reopening
