karl drais included a pivoting brake shoe that could be pressed against the rear iron tyre of his 1817 laufmaschine this was continued on the earliest bicycles with pedals , such as the boneshaker , which were fitted with a spoon brake to press onto the rear wheel the rider could also slow down by resisting the pedals of the fixed wheel drive the next development of the bicycle , the penny-farthings , were similarly braked with a spoon brake or by back pedalling however , as the rear wheel became smaller and smaller , with more of the rider 's weight over the front wheel , braking on the rear wheel became less effective the front brake , introduced by john kean in 1873 , had been generally adopted by 1880 because of its greater stopping power some penny-farthing riders used only back pedalling and got off and walked down steep hills , but most also used a brake having a brake meant that riders could coast down hill by taking their feet off the pedals and placing the legs over the handlebars , although most riders preferred to dismount and walk down steep hills an alternative to the spoon brake for penny-farthings was the caliper brake patented by browett and harrison in 1887 this early version of caliper braking used a rubber block to contact the outside of the penny-farthing 's small rear tyre the 1870s and 1880s saw the development of the safety bicycle which roughly resembles bicycles today , with two wheels of equal size , initially with solid rubber tyres these were typically equipped with a front spoon brake and no rear brake mechanism , but like penny-farthings they used fixed gears , allowing rear wheel braking by resisting the motion of the pedals the relative fragility of the wooden rims used on most bicycles still precluded the use of rim brakes in the late 1890s came the introduction of rim brakes and the freewheel with the introduction of mass-produced bicycle tire by the dunlop rubber , the use of spoon brakes began to decline , as they tended to quickly wear through the thin casing of the new tyres this problem led to demands for alternative braking systems duck of duck 's cyclery in oakland , california was granted a patent for his duck roller brake ( u.s 594,234 in 1898 , after the advent of freewheel coasting mechanisms , the first internal coaster brakes were introduced for the rear wheel the coaster brake was contained in the rear wheel hub , and was engaged and controlled by backpedaling , thus eliminating the issue of tyre wear the spoon brake , or plunger brake was probably the first type of bicycle brake and precedes the pneumatic tyre perhaps more so than any other form of bicycle brake , the spoon brake is sensitive to road conditions and increases tyre wear dramatically jpg spoon brake on front wheel file : marian038.jpg improvised spoon brake on a chinese cargo tricycle invented in 1897 , the duck brake or duck roller brake used a rod operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin friction rollers ( usually made of wood or rubber ) against the front tyre braking power was enhanced by an extra-long brake lever mounted in parallel with and behind the handlebar , which provided additional leverage when braking ( two hands could be used to pull the lever if necessary ) used in combination with a rear coaster brake , a cyclist of the day could stop much more quickly and with better modulation of braking effort than was possible using only a spoon brake or rear coaster brake parliamentary debates : senate and house of representatives , tariff preferences , volume 34 ( 19 september 1906 ) , p rim brakes are so called because braking force is applied by friction pads to the rim of the rotating wheel , thus slowing it and the bicycle brake pads can be made of leather , rubber or cork and are often mounted in metal '' shoes '' the low price and ease of maintenance of rim brakes makes them popular in low- to mid-price commuter bikes , where the disadvantages are alleviated by the unchallenging conditions because the motion of most brakes is not perfectly horizontal , the pads may lose their centering as they wear , causing the pads to wear unevenly if a rim has a pronounced wobble , then the braking force may be intermittent or uneven , and the pads may rub the rims even when the brake is not applied during braking , the friction surfaces ( brake pads and rims ) will experience thermal heating in normal use this is not a problem , as the brakes are applied with limited force and for a short time , so the heat quickly dissipates to the surrounding air the rubber can be softer for more braking force with less lever effort , or harder for longer life larger pads do not necessarily provide more braking force , but will wear more slowly ( in relation to thickness ) , so can usually be thinner the friction force between brake shoe and rim creates a bending moment around the point where the brake bolt emerges from the fork the following are among the many sub-types of rim brakes : rim brakes have been the subject of countless '' engineering innovations '' a common setup was to combine a front rod brake with a rear coaster brake the design is still in use , typically on african and asian roadsters such as the sohrab and flying pigeon while some designs incorporate dual pivot points & mdash ; the arms pivot on a sub-frame & mdash ; the entire assembly still mounts to a single point but they are almost ubiquitous on road bikes , particularly the side-pull caliper brakes these brakes are now used on inexpensive bikes ; before the introduction of dual-pivot caliper brakes they were used on all types of road bikes one arm pivots at the centre , like a side-pull ; and the other pivots at the side , like a centre-pull these brakes offer a higher mechanical advantage , and result in better braking dual-pivot brakes are slightly heavier than conventional side-pull calipers and can not accurately track an out-of-true rim , or a wheel that flexes from side to side in the frame during hard climbing it is common to see professional racers climbing mountains with the quick-release undone on the rear brake , to eliminate drag from this source tension on the cable is evenly distributed to the two arms , preventing the brake from taking a '' set '' to one side or the other they are more effective than side-pull brakes in long reach applications as the distance between the pivot and brake pad or cable attachment is much shorter , reducing flex '' u-brakes '' ( also known by the trademarked term '' 990-style '' ) are essentially the same design as the centre-pull caliper brake like roller cam brakes , this is a caliper design with pivots located above the rim thus u-brakes are often interchangeable with , and have the same maintenance issues as , roller cam brakes the cantilever brake is a class of brake in which each arm is attached to a separate pivot point on one side of the seat stay or fork both first- and second-class lever designs exist ; second-class is by far the most common in the second-class lever design , the arm pivots below the rim due to a wider possible distance between the mounts and pads , cantilever brakes are often preferred for bicycles that use wide tyres , such as on mountain bikes because the arms move only in their designed arcs , the brake shoe must be adjustable in several planes eventually , one may go underneath the rim , so that the brake does not function it is a centre-pull cantilever design with an outwardly angled arm protruding on each side , a cable stop on the frame or fork to terminate the cable housing , and a straddle cable between the arms similar to centre-pull caliper brakes the cable from the brake lever pulls upwards on the straddle cable , causing the brake arms to rotate up and inward thus squeezing the rim between the brake pads low profile brakes require more careful attention to cable geometry than traditional cantilevers but are now the most common type traditional cantilever brakes are difficult to adapt to bicycle suspensions and protrude somewhat from the frame the moderate performance advantage ( greater power and control ) they offer over cable actuated rim brakes is offset by their greater weight and complexity it is possible to ride a bicycle with a buckled wheel if it has disc brakes , where it would not be possible with a rim brake because the buckled wheel would bind on the brake pads cable-actuated disc brakes were traditionally the only type of disc brake that could be used with the brake levers found on drop handlebars , sheldon brown , quoted at but this is no longer the case
