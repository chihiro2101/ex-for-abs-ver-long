in monarchies with either an uncodified or partly unwritten constitution ( such as the united kingdom or canada ) or a wholly written constitution that consists of a text augmented by additional conventions , traditions , letters patent , etc there are usually strict constitutional conventions concerning when these powers may be used , and these conventions are enforced by public pressure using these powers in contravention of tradition would generally provoke a constitutional crisis most constitutional monarchies employ a system that includes the principle of responsible government in such an order , the reserve powers are thought to be the means by which the monarch and his or her viceregal representatives can legitimately exist as '' constitutional guardians '' or '' umpires '' , tasked with guaranteeing that cabinet and parliament adhere to the fundamental constitutional principles of the rule of law and responsible government itself evatt felt that the reserve powers could be codified and still serve their intended function in a responsible government system , as they do in ireland , japan , and sweden in belgium a constitutional provision explicitly states that no act of the monarch is valid without the signature of a member or members of the government , which thereby becomes solely responsible , hence excluding any reserve power for the crown in legal terminology , a competence vested in 'the king ' thus very often means the government , as opposed to formal laws which require a ( sometimes qualified ) parliamentary majority in 1990 , when a law liberalising belgium 's abortion laws was approved by parliament , king baudouin refused to give his royal assent , only the second time in belgium 's history the monarch elected to do so within the dominions , until the 1920s , most reserve powers were exercised by a governor-general on the advice of either the local or the british government , though the latter took precedence while the reserve power to dismiss a government has not been used in the united kingdom since 1834 , this power has been exercised more recently in australia , on two occasions : on 13 may 1932 , when the governor of new south wales philip game lang dismissal crisis in both cases an election was held very soon afterwards and , again in both cases , the dismissed government was massively defeated by popular vote owen dixon society ejournal ( gold coast , queensland : bond university , 2007 ) there was speculation on the potential exercise of vice-regal reserve power by campbell , in dismissing the premier in the absence of a parliamentary motion of no confidence barlow & corkery '' sir walter campbell '' , 28-29 these are among several exercises of the reserve powers in australia in the 20th century at state and federal levels clark had advised guichon to dissolve the legislature as , in her view , the appointment of a speaker would have resulted in frequent tie votes and an untenable position no modern governor general has disallowed a bill , though lieutenant governor ( canada ) have they also had a real choice in selecting premiers – parliaments of the period being composed of independent members who formed loose and shifting factions – and were not always obliged to act on the advice of their ministers as new zealand 's political system matured , the colonial office increasingly instructed the governors to follow the advice of local ministers , and the powers of the office have continually shrunk sir kenneth keith describes the use of these powers as based on the principle that '' the queen reigns , but the government rules , so long as it has the support of the house of representatives '' it may also be exercised if a prime minister no-confidence motion and resigns instead of advising a dissolution of parliament ; the last such occasion was in 1912 though the power of appointment is listed among the reserve powers , in fact the governor-general abides by strict conventions , and has always appointed the leader of the dominant party in the house of representatives if a defeated prime minister refuses to do either of these two things , the governor-general could use the reserve powers to either dismiss the prime minister ( see above ) , or dissolve parliament without the prime minister 's advice likewise , if the prime minister tenders his resignation , the governor-general could theoretically refuse to accept it , and dissolve parliament against the prime minister 's advice if a prime minister has been defeated by a vote of no confidence , a refusal by the governor-general to dissolve parliament would , in effect , force the prime minister to resign and make way for a successor see the lascelles principles for factors which might guide the governor-general in making a decision on whether or not to grant a dissolution in those circumstances others , such as professor philip joseph , believe the governor-general does retain the power to refuse royal assent to bills in exceptional circumstances - such as the abolition of democracy two successive governors , the earl of onslow and the earl of glasgow , refused to make the appointments , until the colonial office intervened in ballance 's favour though these remained the same in law for the time being , later governors and governments considered that there would be far fewer scenarios in which their use would be appropriate the outgoing prime minister , sir rob muldoon , had just lost an election , but refused to advise the governor-general , david beattie , to make urgent regulations desired not only by the incoming prime minister , david lange , but also by many in muldoon 's own party and cabinet muldoon eventually relented under pressure from his own cabinet , making the use of beattie 's reserve powers unnecessary a constitutional crisis occurred in saint kitts and nevis in 1981 , when the governor , sir probyn inniss , used his reserve powers to refuse assent to a bill passed by the government of sir kennedy simmonds , the country 's premier the constitution of tuvalu provides , in article 52 , that the governor-general exercises his powers '' only in accordance with the advice of ( a ) the cabinet ; or ( b ) the prime minister in 2013 , governor-general iakoba italeli was requested by the opposition to act without ( and indeed against ) the prime minister 's advice '' parliament needs one yearly meeting only says defiant tuvalu pm '' , radio new zealand international , 2 july 2013 the opposition turned to the governor-general harold wilson , leading a minority government in 1974 , was advised elizabeth ii might refuse to dissolve parliament if she could identify an alternative prime minister able to command a cross-party majority this was last done in britain in 1963 when elizabeth ii appointed sir alec douglas-home as prime minister , on the advice of outgoing harold macmillan in 1999 , queen elizabeth ii , acting on the advice of the government , refused to signify her consent to the military action against iraq ( parliamentary approval ) bill , which sought to transfer from the monarch to parliament the power to authorise military strikes against iraq subsequently , wilson asked that if the government were defeated on the floor of the house of commons , the queen would grant a dissolution , which she agreed to following japan 's defeat in world war ii , the emperor 's role is defined in chapter i of the 1947 constitution of japan , as decided by the foreign powers that had defeated japan in the war it is through this constitutional language that wider '' reserve powers '' are granted to the monarch however , the president has the authority to dissolve the government or parliament , grant pardon to criminals , block bills/budgets by the legislature or declare an emergency during the regime of the caretaker government , the president 's power expanded dramatically ; effectively ( s ) he is no longer a ceremonial head of state on a larger scale , this is consistent with a tradition of the roman republic ( which has always been an inspiration for the successive french republics ) , to give six months of dictatorial power to a citizen in case of an imminent danger of invasion however , the president has certain reserve powers , also known as '' discretionary powers '' in ireland , which can be exercised by the president at his or her discretion – without , or even contrary to , the government 's advice by the second of these powers , the president may refuse to assent to legislation passed by parliament when he or she considers it to be unconstitutional
