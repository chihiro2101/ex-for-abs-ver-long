the township was established at the base of the former roman fortress of levefanum in the 7th century the frankish carolingian empire and the frisians fought for control of the territory , until the franks gained control of the frisian coast in 719 dorestad flourished between the 7th century and the mid-9th century in the 7th century , it was clear that dorestad had the potential to become a major port the franks won out at the end of the 7th century and closely monitored the growth of dorestad , which led to dorestad 's economic expansion via international trade and the establishment of a mint in the upper town it is assumed that there was a toll as well as harbour fees , collected by the king 's representatives at dorestad over time , many coins have been discovered in the dorestad area , supporting the idea of rapid growth and control of the harbour as well as the presence of a mint as a result , the franks slowly lost interest in the town and granted the church of utrecht responsibility over a sizeable portion of dorestad it is thought that the decline occurred because of viking raids as well as a decline in the economy by the 830s , under the control of louis the pious , the expansion of the harbour had halted altogether , but coins continued to be minted for some time however , lothair i was unable to protect dorestad and the other frankish territories from economic turmoil as a result , louis the pious quickly took back dorestad and exiled his son to italy at this time , two things occurred in dorestad that led to its eventual downfall the first was that the franks lost even more interest in dorestad and as a result , even more control was transferred to the church the second was that lothair i was stirring up trouble for the franks by encouraging viking raids on the frisian coast when he was exiled although dorestad was raided only once , in 834 , it seems that the town never fully recovered afterwards the franks allowed hroerekr to take control of the land as long as he protected the coast from viking invasions the coast was battered by viking attacks , but it seems that dorestad was left relatively unscathed the danish rulers held court on the coast for quite some time despite being not well liked by the people that they ruled under danish control , dorestad became less significant retrieved may 1 , 2020 , from the danish king sigfred felt threatened by the advancement of the franks under the leadership of charlemagne only the '' lower town '' was excavated by archaeologists as much of dorestad was eroded away by the river bend
