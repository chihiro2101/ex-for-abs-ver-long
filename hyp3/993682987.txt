recursion theory originated in the 1930s , with work of kurt gödel , alonzo church , rózsa péter , alan turing , stephen kleene , and emil post nowadays these are often considered as a single hypothesis , the church–turing thesis , which states that any function that is computable by an algorithm is a computable function although initially skeptical , by 1946 gödel argued in favor of this thesis : : '' tarski has stressed in his lecture ( and i think justly ) the great importance of the concept of general recursiveness ( or turing 's computability ) it seems to me that this importance is largely due to the fact that with this concept one has for the first time succeeded in giving an absolute notion to an interesting epistemological notion , i.e both reprintings have the following footnote added to the davis volume by gödel in 1965 : '' to be more precise : a function of integers is computable in any formal system containing arithmetic if and only if it is computable in arithmetic , where a function f is called computable in s if there is in s a computable term representing f ( p with a definition of effective calculation came the first proofs that there are problems in mathematics that can not be effectively decided church ( 1936a , 1936b ) and turing ( 1936 ) , inspired by techniques used by gödel ( 1931 ) to prove his incompleteness theorems , independently demonstrated that the entscheidungsproblem is not effectively decidable the main form of computability studied in recursion theory was introduced by turing ( 1936 ) a set of natural numbers is said to be a computable set ( also called a decidable , recursive , or turing computable set ) if there is a turing machine that , given a number n , halts with output 1 if n is in the set and halts with output 0 if n is not in the set a function f from the natural numbers to themselves is a recursive or ( turing ) computable function if there is a turing machine that , on input n , halts and returns output f ( n ) the definition in terms of μ-recursive functions as well as a different definition of rekursiv functions by gödel led to the traditional name recursive for sets and functions computable by a turing machine not every set of natural numbers is computable the halting problem , which is the set of ( descriptions of ) turing machines that halt on input 0 , is a well-known example of a noncomputable set thus the halting problem is an example of a recursively enumerable set , which is a set that can be enumerated by a turing machine ( other terms for recursively enumerable include computably enumerable and semidecidable ) the recursively enumerable sets , although not decidable in general , have been studied in detail in recursion theory beginning with the theory of recursive sets and functions described above , the field of recursion theory has grown to include the study of many closely related topics these are not independent areas of research : each of these areas draws ideas and results from the others , and most recursion theorists are familiar with the majority of them recursion theory in mathematical logic has traditionally focused on relative computability , a generalization of turing computability defined using oracle turing machines , introduced by turing & nbsp ; ( 1939 ) an oracle turing machine is a hypothetical device which , in addition to performing the actions of a regular turing machine , is able to ask questions of an oracle , which is a particular set of natural numbers each question will be immediately answered correctly , even if the oracle set is not computable the turing degree of a set gives a precise measure of how uncomputable the set is these hierarchy levels are defined inductively , σ n+1 contains just all sets which are recursively enumerable relative to σ n ; σ 1 contains the recursively enumerable sets the index sets given here are even complete for their levels , that is , all the sets in these levels can be many-one reduced to the given index sets goncharov discovered for example a class of recursively enumerable sets for which the numberings fall into exactly two classes with respect to recursive isomorphisms post 's problem was solved with a method called the priority method ; a proof using this method is called a priority argument priority arguments have been employed to solve many problems in recursion theory , and have been classified into a hierarchy based on their complexity ( soare 1987 ) there are close relationships between the turing degree of a set of natural numbers and the difficulty ( in terms of the arithmetical hierarchy ) of defining that set using a first-order logic gödel 's proofs show that the set of logical consequences of an effective first-order theory is a recursively enumerable set , and that if the theory is strong enough this set will be uncomputable according to rogers , the sets of interest in recursion theory are the noncomputable sets , partitioned into equivalence classes by computable bijections of the natural numbers
