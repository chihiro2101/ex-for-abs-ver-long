acer platanoides is a deciduous tree , growing to tall with a trunk up to in diameter , and a broad , rounded crown under ideal conditions in its native range , norway maple may live up to 250 years , but often has a much shorter life expectancy ; in north america , for example , sometimes only 60 years the norway maple is a member ( and is the type species ) of the section platanoidea pax , characterised by flattened , disc-shaped seeds and the shoots and leaves containing milky sap other related species in this section include acer campestre ( field maple ) , acer cappadocicum ( cappadocian maple ) , acer lobelii ( lobel 's maple ) , and acer truncatum ( shandong maple ) from the field maple , the norway maple is distinguished by its larger leaves with pointed , not blunt , lobes , and from the other species by the presence of one or more teeth on all of the lobes it is also frequently confused with the more distantly related acer saccharum ( sugar maple ) the sugar maple is easy to differentiate by clear sap in the petiole ( leaf stem ) ; norway maple petioles have white sap the tips of the points on norway maple leaves reduce to a fine '' hair '' , while the tips of the points on sugar maple leaves are , on close inspection , rounded on mature trees , sugar maple bark is more shaggy , while norway maple bark has small , often criss-crossing grooves as with most maples , norway maple is normally dioecious ( separate male and female trees ) , occasionally monoecious , and trees may change gender from year to year the fruits of norway maple are paired samaras with widely diverging wings , distinguishing them from those of sycamore , acer pseudoplatanus which are at 90 degrees to each other norway maple seeds are flattened , while those of sugar maple are globose history and range of norway maple during the 1950sâ€“60s it became popular as a street tree due to the large-scale loss of american elms from dutch elm disease the norway maple was introduced to northeastern north america between 1750 and 1760 as an ornamental shade tree the norway maple also suffers less herbivory than the sugar maple , allowing it to gain a competitive advantage against the latter species the larvae of a number of species of lepidoptera feed on norway maple foliage
