al ( oh ) 3 is built up of double layers of hydroxyl groups with aluminium ions occupying two-thirds of the octahedral holes between the two layers all feature layers of octahedron aluminium hydroxide units , with hydrogen bonds between the layers aluminium hydroxide is amphoteric virtually all the aluminium hydroxide used commercially is manufactured by the bayer process which involves dissolving bauxite in sodium hydroxide at temperatures up to this aluminium hydroxide can be converted to aluminium oxide or alumina by calcination the residue or bauxite tailings , which is mostly iron oxide , is highly caustic due to residual sodium hydroxide heating converts it to activated aluminas , which are used as desiccants , adsorbent in gas purification , and catalyst supports some such products are formulated to minimize such effects through the inclusion of equal concentrations of magnesium hydroxide or magnesium carbonate , which have counterbalancing laxative effects aluminium hydroxide is sometimes called '' alum '' , a term generally reserved for one of several sulfates in the 1960s and 1970s it was speculated that aluminium was related to various neurological disorders , including alzheimer 's disease
