in questionnaire surveys , 35–50 % of women report that they have at some time experienced the gushing of fluid during orgasm for instance kratochvíl ( 1994 ) surveyed 200 women and found that 6 % reported ejaculating , an additional 13 % had some experience and about 60 % reported release of fluid without actual gushing reports on the volume of fluid expelled vary considerably , starting from amounts that would be imperceptible to a woman , to mean values of 1–5 ml the suggestion that women can expel fluid from their genital area as part of sexual arousal has been described by women 's health writer rebecca chalker as '' one of the most hotly debated questions in modern sexology '' female ejaculation has been discussed in anatomical , medical , and biological literature throughout recorded history the reasons for the interest in female ejaculation have been questioned by feminist writers de occultis naturae miraculis 1557 , reprinted as the secret miracles of nature one sex two sex theory this century saw an increasing understanding of female sexual anatomy and function , in particular the work of the bartholin family in denmark cited in chalker 2000 , p.121 he identified the source as the glandular structures and ducts surrounding the urethra '' however he appears not to distinguish between the lubrication of the perineum during arousal and an orgasmic ejaculate when he refers to liquid '' which in libidinous women often rushes out at the mere sight of a handsome man '' however , his prime purpose was to distinguish between generative fluid and pleasurable fluid , in his stand on the aristotelian semen controversy krafft-ebing 's study of sexual perversion , psychopathia sexualis ( 1886 ) , describes female ejaculation under the heading '' congenital sexual inversion in women '' as a perversion related to neurasthenia and homosexuality these clearly showed the difference between the original glands identified by skene at the urinary meatus , and the more proximal collections of glandular tissue emptying directly into the urethra a more definitive contemporary account of ejaculation appeared shortly after , in 1950 , with the publication of an essay by gräfenberg based on his observations of women during orgasm however this paper made little impact , and was dismissed in the major sexological writings of that time , such as kinsey ( 1953 ) kinsey , a.c & nbsp ;

74–5 ) historically in rwanda , the kunyaza sexual technique has the reputation of triggering female ejaculation ( kunyara ) amongst the buganda tribe of uganda , the sexual practice is called kachabali ( spraying the wall ) there have been few studies on female ejaculation stated that '' many individuals refer to any fluid expressed from the vagina or urethra during coitus as female ejaculate , which leads to significant confusion in the literature research has attempted to use chemicals that are excreted in the urine so that any urinary contamination can be detected some research has distinguished between female ejaculation and what is colloquially known as squirting or gushing towards the later part of the 20th century , there was significant confusion between female ejaculation and coital incontinence in 1982 , bohlen explained the accepted wisdom : scientific studies from the 1980s and later have demonstrated that the substance produced is distinct from urine , though it does show similarities such as alkalinity with urine it is also important for physicians to distinguish orgasmic ejaculation from vaginal discharges which may require further investigation and treatment in individual cases , the exact source of any reported discharge may not be obvious without further investigation in 1985 , a different group studied 27 women and found only urine , suggesting that results depend critically on the methods used therefore , claims of larger amounts of ejaculate are likely to contain at least some amount of urine one approach is to use a chemical like methylene blue so that any urinary component can be detected belzer showed that in one woman he studied , the dye was found in her urine , but not her orgasmic expulsion pap and psa have been identified in the para-urethral tissues , using biochemical and immunohistochemical methods , suggesting that the ejaculate is likely to arise from the ducts in these tissues , in a manner homologous to that in the male the debate in the current literature focuses on three threads : the existence of female ejaculation , its source ( s ) and composition , and its relationship to theories of female sexuality the terminology ( such as female prostate and female ejaculation ) invoke images of the female as merely an imitation of the male , mapping the female body onto the male , as if , like the galenic view , it was incomplete a third concern is that of the increasing 'medicalisation ' of women 's sexuality , as expressed by leonore tiefer which finds its most extreme manifestation in the concept of female sexual dysfunction female ejaculation the double standard in the bedroom by eric jackson , 2008/09/22 the-clitoris.com : female ejaculation & the g-spot : instructions & diagrams from a feminist perspective
