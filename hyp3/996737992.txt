q-switching is achieved by putting some type of variable attenuator inside the laser 's optical resonator when the attenuator is functioning , light which leaves the gain medium does not return , and lasing can not begin initially the laser medium is pumped while the q-switch is set to prevent feedback of light into the gain medium ( producing an optical resonator with low q ) since the rate of stimulated emission is dependent on the amount of light entering the medium , the amount of energy stored in the gain medium increases as the medium is pumped at this point , the q-switch device is quickly changed from low to high q , allowing feedback and the process of optical amplifier by stimulated emission to begin because of the large amount of energy already stored in the gain medium , the intensity of light in the laser resonator builds up very quickly ; this also causes the energy stored in the medium to be depleted almost as quickly the net result is a short pulse of light output from the laser , known as a giant pulse , which may have a very high peak intensity initially , the loss of the absorber is high , but still low enough to permit some lasing once a large amount of energy is stored in the gain medium after the pulse , the absorber recovers to its high-loss state before the gain recovers , so that the next pulse is delayed until the energy in the gain medium is fully replenished the cavity q goes from low to high to start the laser buildup , and then goes from high to low to '' dump '' the beam from the cavity all at once pulses of light from another laser ( the '' master oscillator '' ) are injected into the cavity by lowering the q to allow the pulse to enter and then increasing the q to confine the pulse to the cavity where it can be amplified by repeated passes through the gain medium q-switched lasers are often used in applications which demand high laser intensities in nanosecond pulses , such as metal cutting or pulsed holography nd : yag lasers are currently the most favoured lasers due to their high peak powers , high repetition rates and relatively low costs
