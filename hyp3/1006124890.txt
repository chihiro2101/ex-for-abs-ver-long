usually , an enzyme molecule has only two active sites , and the active sites fit with one specific type of substrate an active site contains a binding site that binds the substrate and orients it for catalysis the orientation of the substrate and the close proximity between it and the active site is so important that in some cases the enzyme can still function properly even though all other parts are mutated and lose function initially , the interaction between the active site and the substrate is non-covalent and transient the charge distribution on the substrate and active site must be complementary , which means all positive and negative charges must be cancelled out the active site usually contains non-polar amino acids , although sometimes polar amino acids may also occur if these interactions are interfered with , for example by extreme ph values , high temperature or high ion concentrations , this will cause the enzyme to denature and lose its catalytic activity a tighter fit between an active site and the substrate molecule is believed to increase the efficiency of a reaction this concept was suggested by the 19th-century chemist emil fischer he proposed that the active site and substrate are two stable structures that fit perfectly without any further modification , just like a key fits into a lock if one substrate perfectly binds to its active site , the interactions between them will be strongest , resulting in high catalytic efficiency for example , the competitive enzyme inhibitor methylglucoside can bind tightly to the active site of 4-alpha-glucanotransferase and perfectly fits into it the lock and key hypothesis can not explain this , as it would predict a high efficiency of methylglucoside glycosyl transfer due to its tight binding daniel koshland 's theory of enzyme-substrate binding is that the active site and the binding portion of the substrate are not exactly complementary the induced fit model is a development of the lock-and-key model and assumes that an active site is flexible and changes shape until the substrate is completely bound enzyme surface is flexible and only the correct catalyst can induce interaction leading to catalysis conformational changes may then occur as the substrate is bound after the reaction products will move away from the enzyme and the active site returns to its initial shape this hypothesis is supported by the observation that the entire protein domain could move several nanometers during catalysis electrostatic interaction : in an aqueous environment , the oppositely charged groups in amino acid side chains within the active site and substrates attract each other , which is termed electrostatic interaction hydrophobic interaction : non-polar hydrophobic groups tend to aggregate together in the aqueous environment and try to leave from polar solvent these hydrophobic groups usually have long carbon chain and do not react with water molecules once the substrate is bound and oriented to the active site , catalysis can begin they do this by a number of different mechanisms including the approximation of the reactants , nucleophilic/electrophilic catalysis and acid/base catalysis during enzyme catalytic reaction , the substrate and active site are brought together in a close proximity firstly , when substrates bind within the active site the thermodynamic activity of it significantly increases than in solution this means the number of substrate molecules involved in the reaction is also increased this process also reduces the solvation required for the reaction to occur since bulk molecules can be excluded from the active site this energy output can be minimised next , the active site is designed to reorient the substrate to reduce the activation energy for the reaction to occur in addition , this binding is favoured by entropy as the energy cost associated with solution reaction is largely eliminated since solvent can not enter active site in the end , the active site may manipulate the molecular orbital of the substrate into a suitable orientation to reduce activation energy the former step is rate-limit step while the later step is needed to regenerate intact enzyme inhibitors are classified as non-competitive inhibitors when they bind both free enzyme and es complex they usually bind to a different site on the enzyme and alter the 3-dimensional structure of the active site to block substrates from entry or leaving the enzyme thumb an regulatory site is a site on an enzyme , unrelated to its active site , which can bind an effector molecule
