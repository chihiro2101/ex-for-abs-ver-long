the chinese concept of the world was largely a division between the civilized world and the barbarian world and there was little concept of the belief that chinese interests were served by a powerful chinese state chinese nationalism as it emerged in the early 20th century was based on the experience of european nationalism , especially as viewed and interpreted by sun yat-sen the key factor in european nationalism was tradition – some of the newly manufactured – of a cultural identity based primarily on language and ethnicity ethnic nationalism was , in any case , unacceptable to the ruling manchu elitethey were foreigners who conquered china and maintained their own language and traditions odd arne westad , restless empire : china and the worlds in 1750 ( 2012 ) pp anyone who wanted to rise in government non-military service had to be immersed in confucian classics , and pass a very difficult test the discussion of modern chinese nationalism has dominated many political and intellectual debates since the late nineteenth century political scientist suisheng zhao argues that nationalism in china is not monolithic but exists in various forms , including political , liberal , ethnical , and state nationalism the origin of modern chinese nationalism can be traced back to the intellectual debate on race and nation in late nineteenth century shaped by the global discourse of social darwinism , reformers and intellectuals debated how to build a new chinese national subject based on a proper racial order , particularly the man-han relations after the collapse of the qing regime and the founding of the republic of china in 1911 , concerns of both domestic and international threat made the role of racism decline , while anti-imperialism became the new dominant ideology of chinese nationalism over the 1910s while intellectuals and elites advocated their distinctive thoughts on chinese nationalism , political scientist chalmers johnson has pointed out that most of these ideas had very little to do with china 's majority population -- the chinese peasantry he thus proposes to supplement the chinese communist ideology in the discussion of chinese nationalism , which he labels '' peasant nationalism '' chinese nationalism in the early twentieth century was primarily based on anti-manchurism , an ideology that was prevalent among chinese revolutionaries from late nineteenth century to the turn of the twentieth century liang 's thought was based on the idea of racial competition , a concept originating from social darwinism that believed only superior races would survive whereas the inferior races were bound to extinct liang attributed the decline of china to the manchu ( qing ) rulers , who treated the han as an '' alien race '' and imposed a racial hierarchy between the han and the manchus while ignoring the threat of imperial powers he argued that china should be a nation of the orthodox han chinese and no alien race shall rule over them according to zou , the han chinese , as the descendants of the yellow emperor , must overthrow the manchu rule to restore their legitimacy and rights wang jingwei , a chinese revolutionary who later became an important figure in the kuomintang , also believed that the manchus were an inferior race since the han had asserted its dominant role in chinese nationalism , the manchus had to be either absorbed or eradicated in addition to anti-manchurism and anti-imperialism , political scientist chalmers johnson has argued that the rise of power of the ccp through its alliance with the peasantry should also be understood as '' a species of nationalism in the context of social mobilization , chinese nationalism only fully emerged during the second sino-japanese war ( 1937-1945 ) , when the ccp mobilized the peasantry to fight against the japanese invaders the wartime alliance of the chinese peasantry and the ccp manifests how the nationalist ideology of the ccp , or the peasant nationalism , reinforced the desire of the chinese to save and build a strong nation during the 1960s and 1970s , chinese nationalism within mainland china became mixed with the rhetoric of marxism , and nationalistic rhetoric become in large part subsumed into internationalist rhetoric on the other hand , chinese nationalism in taiwan was primarily about preserving the ideals and lineage of sun yat-sen , the party he founded , the kuomintang ( kmt ) , and anti-communism in the 1990s , rising economic standards , the dissolution of soviet union , and the lack of any other legitimizing ideology has led to what most observers see as a resurgence of nationalism within mainland china in the 17th century , with the help of ming chinese rebels , the manchus conquered china proper and set up the qing dynasty it was during this time that the concept of han chinese came into existence as a means of describing the majority of chinese ethnicity due to sinicization in early chinese history over the next decades , chinese nationalism was influenced strongly by russian ethnographic thinking , and the official ideology of the prc asserts that china is a multi-ethnic state , and han chinese , despite being the overwhelming majority ( over 95 % in the mainland ) , they are only one of many ethnic groups of china , each of whose culture and language should be respected chinese muslims have played an important role in chinese nationalism chinese muslims , known as hui people , are a mixture of the descendants of foreign muslims like arabs and persians , mixed with han chinese who converted to islam hu songhan also wrote a prayer in arabic and chinese , praying for allah to support the chinese kuomintang government and defeat japan he proclaimed that mongolia and tibet were part of the republic of china , and not independent countries ma fuxiang had served under the chinese muslim general dong fuxiang , and fought against the foreigners during the boxer rebellion the muslim troops were armed with modern repeater rifles and artillery , and reportedly enthusiastic about going on the offensive and killing foreigners dong fuxiang was a xenophobe and hated foreigners , wanting to drive them out of china various muslim organizations in china like china islamic association ( zhongguo huijiao gonghui ) and the chinese muslim association were sponsored by the kuomintang general bai chongxi , the warlord of guangxi , and a member of the kuomintang , presented himself as the protector of islam in china and harbored muslim intellectuals fleeing from the japanese invasion in guangxi translations from egyptian writings and the quran were used to support propaganda in favour of a jihad against japan uighur street names and signs were changed to chinese , and the chinese muslim troops imported chinese cooks and baths , rather than using uighur ones the chinese muslims even forced the uighur carpet industry at khotan to change its design to chinese versions general ma hushan 's brother ma zhongying denounced separatism in a speech at id kah mosque and told the uighurs to be loyal to the chinese government at nanjing the 36th division had crushed the turkish islamic republic of east turkestan , and the chinese muslim general ma zhancang beheaded the uighur emirs abdullah bughra and nur ahmad jan bughra the uighurs had been promoting islamism in their separatist government , but ma hushan eliminated religion from politics pandatsang rapga , a tibetan politician , founded the tibet improvement party with the goal of modernisation and tibet area ( administrative division ) overt support for formal independence is also muted due to the prc 's insistence on military action should taiwan make such a formal declaration the argument against unification is partly over culture and whether the taiwanese people should see themselves as chinese or taiwanese ; and partly over mistrust of the ruling chinese communist party ( ccp ) , such as its de-democratizing actions in hong kong ( e.g these misgivings are particularly prevalent amongst younger generations of taiwanese , who generally view both the ccp and the kmt as obsolete and consider themselves to have little connection to china except for ancestral cultural roots chinese nationalism has had mutable relationships with chinese living outside of mainland china and taiwan after the end of world war ii , overseas chinese were encouraged or sometimes coerced to regard themselves as citizens of their adopted nations rather than as part of the wider ethnic chinese nationality as a result , ethnic chinese in regional countries such as malaysia , singapore and thailand , as well as in the western world such as australia , canada and the united states were sharply divided over the concept of ethnic chinese from the concept of '' political chinese '' in the 21st century , notable spurs of grassroots chinese nationalism grew from what the chinese saw as the marginalization of their country from japan and the western world as xi jinping became the general secretary of the chinese communist party that solidified his control after 2012 , the ccp has used the phrase '' chinese dream '' , to describe his overarching plans for china
