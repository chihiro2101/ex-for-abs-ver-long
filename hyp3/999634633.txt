he attributed that to either the absorption of light within the galaxy or to modified dynamics in the outer portions of the spiral and not to any form of missing matter a companion paper by maarten schmidt showed that this rotation curve could be fit by a flattened mass distribution more extensive than the light it is also observed that galaxies with a uniform distribution of luminous matter have a rotation curve that rises from the center to the edge , and most low-surface-brightness galaxy ( lsb galaxies ) have the same anomalous rotation curve the rotation curves might be explained by hypothesizing the existence of a substantial amount of matter permeating the galaxy outside of the central bulge that is not emitting light in the mass-to-light ratio of the central bulge this implies that spiral galaxies contain large amounts of dark matter or , in alternative , the existence of exotic physics in action on galactic scales a popular interpretation of these observations is that about 26 % of the mass of the universe is composed of dark matter , a hypothesis type of matter which does not emit or interact with electromagnetic radiation under this theory , galaxies are baryonic condensations of stars and gas ( namely h and he ) that lie at the centers of much larger haloes of dark matter , affected by a gravitational instability caused by primordial density fluctuations a consistent way to predict the rotational velocity of a spiral galaxy is to measure its bolometric luminosity and then read its rotation rate from its location on the tullyâ€“fisher diagram thus the magnitude of the galaxy rotation is related to the galaxy 's visible mass there have been a number of attempts to solve the problem of galaxy rotation by modifying gravity without invoking dark matter using data from the spitzer photometry and accurate rotation curves ( sparc ) database , a group has found the radial acceleration traced by rotation curves could be predicted just from the observed baryon distribution ( that is , including stars and gas but not dark matter ) . a model of galaxy based on a general relativity metric was also proposed , showing that the rotation curves for the milky way , ngc 3031 , ngc 3198 and ngc 7331 are consistent with the mass density distributions of the visible matter , avoiding the need for a massive halo of exotic dark matter observations of a set of spiral galaxies gave evidence that orbital velocities of stars in galaxies were unexpectedly high at large distances from the nucleus
