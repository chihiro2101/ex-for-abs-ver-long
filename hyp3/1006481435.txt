data general ( dg ) was founded by several engineers from digital equipment corporation who were frustrated with dec 's management and left to form their own company edson de castro was the chief engineer in charge of the pdp-8 , dec 's line of inexpensive computers that created the minicomputer market many pdp-8s still operated decades later in these roles convinced he could do one better , de castro began work on his own low-cost 16-bit design the nova , like the pdp-8 , used a simple accumulator-based architecture it lacked general registers and the stack-pointer functionality of the more advanced pdp-11 , as did competing products , such as the hp 2100 ; compilers used hardware-based memory locations in lieu of a stack pointer designed to be rack-mounted similarly to the later pdp-8 machines , it was packaged on four pcb cards and was thus smaller in height , while also including a number of features that made it run considerably faster with the initial success of the nova , data general went public in the fall of 1969 the original nova was soon followed by the faster supernova , which replaced the nova 's 4-bit arithmetic logic unit ( alu ) with a 16-bit version that made the machine roughly four times as fast in 1977 , dg launched a 16-bit microcomputer called the micronova to poor commercial success newer versions of the machine were pre-ordered by many of dg 's customers , which were never delivered many customers sued data general after more than a year of waiting , charging the company with breach of contract , while others simply canceled their orders and went elsewhere the eclipse was originally intended to replace the nova outright , evidenced by the fact that the nova 3 series , released at the same time and utilizing virtually the same internal architecture as the eclipse , was phased out the next year while dg was still struggling with eclipse , in 1977 , digital announced the vax series , their first 32-bit minicomputer line , described as '' super-minis '' it appeared there was an enormous potential market for 32-bit machines , one that dg might be able to '' scoop '' data general immediately launched their own 32-bit effort in 1976 to build what they called the '' world 's best 32-bit machine '' , known internally as the '' fountainhead project '' , or fhp for short ( fountain head project ) the idea was that the instruction set architecture ( isa ) was not fixed , programs could write their own isa and upload it as microcode to the processor 's control store in the spring of 1978 , with fountainhead apparently in development hell , a secret skunkworks project was started to develop an alternative 32-bit system known as '' eagle '' by a team led by tom west it was backwards-compatible with 16-bit eclipse applications , used the same command-line interpreter , but offered improved 32-bit performance over the vax 11/780 while using fewer components by late 1979 , it became clear that eagle would deliver before fountainhead , igniting an intense turf war within the company for constantly shrinking project funds in the meantime , customers were abandoning data general in droves , driven not only by the delivery problems with the original eclipse , including very serious quality control and customer service problems , but also the power and versatility of digital 's new vax line the eagle project was the subject of tracy kidder 's pulitzer prize-winning book , the soul of a new machine , making the mv line the best-documented computer project in recent history the mv systems generated an almost miraculous turnaround for data general one of data general 's significant customers at this time was the united states forest service , which starting in the mid-1980s used dg systems installed at all levels from headquarters in washington , d.c the introduction , implementation , and effects of the dg systems in usfs were documented in a series of evaluative reports prepared in the late 1980s by the rand corporation the mv series came in various iterations , from the mv/2000 ( later mv/2500 ) , mv/4000 , mv/10000 , mv/15000 , mv/20000 , mv/30000 , mv/40000 and ultimately concluded with the mv/60000ha minicomputer yet , there were failures among the system 's many daughter boards , back-plane , and mid-plane dg technicians were kept quite busy replacing boards and many blamed poor quality control at the dg factory in mexico where they were made and refurbished dg had also changed their marketing to focus on direct sales to fortune 100 companies and thus alienated many resellers the aos/vs software was the most commonly used dg software product and included cli ( command line interpreter ) allowing for complex scripting , dump/load , and other custom components pln ( created by robert nichols ) was the host language for a number of dg products , making them easier to develop , enhance , and maintain than macro assembler equivalents pln smacked of a micro-subset of pl/i , in sharp contrast to other languages of the time , such as bliss the rpg product ( shipped in 1976 ) incorporated a language runtime system implemented as a virtual machine which executed pre-compiled code as sequences of pln statements and eclipse commercial instruction routines the latter provided microcode acceleration of arithmetic and conversion operations for a wide range of now-arcane data types such as overpunch characters the dg easy product , a portable application platform developed by nichols and others from 1975 to 1979 but never marketed , had roots easily traceable back to the rpg vm created by stephen schleimer the first product was idea ( interactive data entry/access ) , which consisted of a screen design tool ( ifmt ) , tp controller ( imon ) , and a program development language ( ifpl ) the name '' aviion '' was a reversed play on the name of dg 's first product , nova , implying '' nova ii '' the clariion line was marketed not only to aviion and data general mv series customers , but also to customers running servers from other vendors such as sun microsystems , hewlett packard and silicon graphics data general would be only one of many new england based computer companies , including the original digital equipment corporation , that collapsed or were sold to larger companies after the 1980s edward zander was product marketing manager at data general before his positions at apollo computer , sun microsystems and motorola as ceo
