in asimov 's writings the endochronicity of thiotimoline is explained by the fact that in the thiotimoline molecule , there is at least one carbon atom such that , while two of the carbon 's four chemical bonds lie in normal spacetime , one of the bonds projects into the future and another into the past thiotimoline is derived from the bark of the ( fictitious ) shrub rosacea karlsbadensis rugo , and the thiotimoline molecule includes at least fourteen hydroxy groups , two amine groups , and one sulfonic acid group , and possibly one nitro compound group as well campbell , the editor of astounding science fiction accepted it for publication on 10 june , agreeing to asimov 's request that it appear under a pseudonym in deference to asimov 's concern that he might alienate potential doctoral examiners at columbia university if he were revealed as the author some months later asimov was alarmed to see the piece appear in the march 1948 issue of astounding under his own name , and copies of the issue circulated at the columbia chemistry department in 1952 , asimov wrote a second spoof scientific paper on thiotimoline called '' the micropsychiatric applications of thiotimoline '' like the first , it included charts , graphs , tables , and citations of fake articles from fake journals ( along with one real citation : asimov 's own earlier spoof article from astounding , which was listed tongue-in-cheek as the journal of astounding science fiction ) it also claims that one effect is that when people with multiple personalities add the water , some parts of the thiotimoline dissolve before others , due to some of the individual 's personalities being more determined than others the first two thiotimoline '' articles '' appeared together in asimov 's first collection of science essays , only a trillion ( 1957 ) , under the joint title '' the marvellous properties of thiotimoline '' asimov also included the original article in his 1972 collection the early asimov according to asimov , two scottish researchers have developed a '' telechronic battery '' , which uses a series of 77,000 interconnected endochronometers to allow a final sample of thiotimoline to dissolve up to a day before water is added to an initial sample finally , asimov describes attempts to create a '' heisenberg failure '' , to get a sample of thiotimoline to dissolve without later adding water to it '' thiotimoline and the space age '' appeared in the october 1960 issue of astounding , which was then in the final stages of changing its name to analog vernon 's speech explains that thiotimoline was first mentioned in 1948 by a semi-mythical scientist named azimuth or asymptote , but that serious study of the compound did n't begin until the 21st century scientist almirante worked out the theory of steric hindrance one effect of endochronicity is that if one fails to add water to an object that has reacted to water , the object will travel into the future in search of water to interact with a research note can be found in one location which makes reference to '' thiomotilene crystals '' and their '' endochronic properties '' , which in turn strongly suggests motilene 's name be derived from thiotimoline
