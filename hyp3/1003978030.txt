midden samples in this area suggest occupation prior to the construction of the post-classical houselots the early date would suggest that this temple was built and in use in mayapan 's early history carbon dating of the pits below what was assumed to be q-97 ( again the label had eroded ) dated from a.d charcoal found in the early construction phase of the site 's main pyramid was dated a.d mayapan yucatan mexico , h.e.d ledyard smith , publication 619 : carnegie institution of washington , washington , d.c 8 kukulcan 's realm : urban life at ancient mayapán , marilyn masson & carlos peraza lope , university press of colorado 2014 , chapter 8 : militarism , misery and collapse in the settlement zone , researchers found : white-tailed deer ( 8.4 % ) , dog ( 1.4 % ) , turkey ( 5.3 % ) , iguana ( 14.5 % ) , and fish ( 3.6 % ) both turtle and rabbit remains were found in both sites , but they were consumed in small amounts ( less than 1.5 % ) they concluded that the fish were being traded into mayapan , and not collected near the site if the fish had been prepared at the site , the heads would have been common refuse zacpeten on lake salpeten & nbsp ; – incense burners found at this site are nearly identical to those found at mayapan the temple assemblages at zacpeten are very similar to those at mayapan topoxte architectural remains show a similar stone carving style to mayapan the two sites appear to have been abandoned around the same time ; which may suggest a connection between their governments architectural and artifact connections are seen between mayapan and the utatlan in highland guatemala el chayal in guatemala was the only source of the obsidian found at mayapan this area may have mediated trade between mayapan and the rest of central mexico sculptures and murals at mayapan suggest that there was contact between mayapan and the rising aztec empire some mayapan figures showed details of aztec dress , and what appears to be an aztec deity is carved on an altar in mayapan the symbolism present in mayapan is particularly significant , partially because the center of the site is mainly used for ritual purposes : representations of quetzalcoatl : murals in structure q.80 show reptile iconography which has been interpreted as participation in mixteca-puebla traditions ( milbrath 2009:583 ) there are also depictions of the monkey-man god most of the iconography in mayapan is found either in murals on the temple walls , stone carving , or carved stone covered in plaster the integration of classes extends to the outer edges of the residential areas probably due to the convenience of being close to the agricultural fields this is shown in relation to the analysis of household oratarios and those oriented around the ceremonial center of mayapan the site of mayapan was abandoned sometime in the 15th century ( 2009 ) '' appendix : inventory and lot descriptions '' carnegie institution current reports on mayapan tatiana proskouriakoff ( 1962 ) civic and religious structures at mayapán , in “ introduction , ” in mayapán , yucatan , mexico , by harry e '' literary sources for the history of mayapan '' , in mayapan , yucatán , mexico
