the main organs involved in urination are the urinary bladder and the urethra fibers in the pelvic nerves constitute the main afferent limb of the voiding reflex ; the parasympathetic fibers to the bladder that constitute the excitatory efferent limb also travel in these nerves part of the urethra is surrounded by the male or female external urethral sphincter , which is innervated by the somatic pudendal nerve originating in the cord , in an area termed onuf 's nucleus smooth muscle bundles pass on either side of the urethra , and these fibers are sometimes called the internal urethral sphincter , although they do not encircle the urethra further along the urethra is a sphincter of skeletal muscle , the sphincter of the membranous urethra ( external urethral sphincter ) micturition is fundamentally a spinobulbospinal reflex facilitated and inhibited by higher brain centers such as the pontine micturition center and , like defecation , subject to voluntary facilitation and inhibition in healthy individuals , the lower urinary tract has two discrete phases of activity : the storage ( or guarding ) phase , when urine is stored in the bladder ; and the voiding phase , when urine is released through the urethra the state of the reflex system is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra at low bladder volumes , afferent firing is low , resulting in excitation of the outlet ( the sphincter and urethra ) , and relaxation of the bladder at high bladder volumes , afferent firing increases , causing a conscious sensation of urinary urge voiding continues until the bladder empties completely , at which point the bladder relaxes and the outlet contracts to re-initiate storage the ability to voluntarily inhibit micturition develops by the age of 2–3 years , as control at higher levels of the central nervous system develops in the adult , the volume of urine in the bladder that normally initiates a reflex contraction is about during storage , bladder pressure stays low , because of the bladder 's highly compliant nature a plot of bladder ( intravesical ) pressure against the depressant of fluid in the bladder ( called a cystometrogram ) , will show a very slight rise as the bladder is filled this phenomenon is a manifestation of the law of laplace , which states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius in the case of the bladder , the tension increases as the organ fills , but so does the radius the bladder 's smooth muscle has some inherent contractile activity ; however , when its nerve supply is intact , stretch receptors in the bladder wall initiate a reflex contraction that has a lower threshold than the inherent contractile response of the muscle action potentials carried by sensory neurons from stretch receptors in the urinary bladder wall travel to the sacral segments of the spinal cord through the pelvic nerves since bladder wall stretch is low during the storage phase , these afferent neurons fire at low frequencies low-frequency afferent signals cause relaxation of the bladder by inhibiting sacral parasympathetic preganglionic neurons and exciting lumbar sympathetic preganglionic neurons conversely , afferent input causes contraction of the sphincter through excitation of onuf 's nucleus , and contraction of the bladder neck and urethra through excitation of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons diuresis ( production of urine by the kidney ) occurs constantly , and as the bladder becomes full , afferent firing increases , yet the micturition reflex can be voluntarily inhibited until it is appropriate to begin voiding voiding begins when a voluntary signal is sent from the brain to begin urination , and continues until the bladder is empty bladder afferent signals ascend the spinal cord to the periaqueductal gray , where they project both to the pontine micturition center and to the cerebrum the firing of these neurons causes the wall of the bladder to contract ; as a result , a sudden , sharp rise in intravesical pressure occurs when the external urinary sphincter is relaxed urine is released from the urinary bladder when the pressure there is great enough to force urine to flow out of the urethra the flow of urine through the urethra has an overall excitatory role in micturition , which helps sustain voiding until the bladder is empty urine remaining in the male urethra is expelled by several contractions of the bulbospongiosus muscle , and , by some men , manual squeezing along the length of the penis to expel the rest of the urine for land mammals over 1 kilogram , the duration of urination does not vary with body mass , being dispersed around an average of 21 seconds ( standard deviation 13 seconds ) , despite a 4 order of magnitude ( 1000× ) difference in bladder volume one possibility is that the voluntary relaxation of the muscles of the pelvic floor causes a sufficient downward tug on the detrusor muscle to initiate its contraction another possibility is the excitation or disinhibition of neurons in the pontine micturition center , which causes concurrent contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the sphincter there is another facilitatory area in the posterior hypothalamus the bladder can be made to contract by voluntary facilitation of the spinal voiding reflex when it contains only a few milliliters of urine voluntary contraction of the abdominal muscles aids the expulsion of urine by increasing the pressure applied to the urinary bladder wall , but voiding can be initiated without straining even when the bladder is nearly empty in many males the feeling of the need to urinate can be sensed at the base of the penis as well as the bladder , even though the neural activity associated with a full bladder comes from the bladder itself , and can be felt there as well in females the need to urinate is felt in the lower abdomen region when the bladder is full micturition syncope , a vasovagal response which may cause fainting paruresis , also known as shy bladder syndrome , is an example of a bladder interruption from the brain that often causes total interruption until the person has left a public area as these people may have difficulty urinating in the presence of others and will consequently avoid using urinals directly adjacent to another person when the sacral dorsal roots are cut in experimental animals or interrupted by diseases of the dorsal roots such as tabes dorsalis in humans , all reflex contractions of the bladder are abolished when the afferent and efferent nerves are both destroyed , as they may be by tumors of the cauda equina or filum terminale , the bladder is flaccid and distended for a while after spinal shock has passed , a spinally mediated voiding reflex ensues , although there is no voluntary control and no inhibition or facilitation from higher centers the reflex hyperactivity is made worse , and may be caused , by infection in the bladder wall due to the positions where the urethra exits the body , males and females often use different techniques for urination elderly males with prostate gland enlargement may benefit from sitting down while in healthy males , no difference is found in the ability to urinate it is also possible for females to urinate while standing , and while clothed an alternative method for women to urinate standing is to use a tool known as a female urination device to assist a common technique used in many undeveloped nations involves holding the child by the backs of the thighs , above the ground , facing outward , in order to urinate resisting the urge to urinate because of lack of facilities can promote urinary tract infections which can lead to more serious infections and , in rare situations , can cause renal damage in women male dogs , as well as wolves , sometimes lift a leg and attempt to urinate even when their bladders are empty & nbsp ; – this is known as a '' raised-leg display '' , '' shadow-urination '' , or '' pseudo-urination '' leg-lifting is more common in male wolves than female wolves , although dominant females also use the raised-leg posture
