the thunderbirds squadron is a named usaf squadron , meaning it does not carry a numerical designation it is also one of the oldest squadrons in the air force , its origins dating to the organization of the 30th aero squadron , formed at kelly field , texas , on 13 june 1917 as the squadron performs no more than 88 air demonstrations each year , replacements must be trained for about half of the team each year , in order to provide a constant mix of experience in addition to their air demonstration responsibilities , the thunderbirds are part of the usaf combat force and if required , can be rapidly integrated into an operational fighter unit ^ '' gao : april 2007 : tactical aircraft : dod needs a joint and integrated investment strategy '' the thunderbirds perform aerial demonstrations in the f-16c fighting falcon , and they also fly two f-16d twin-seat trainers the f-16 has been the demonstration aircraft for the thunderbirds since the 1983 season in january 1982 , four members of the squadron were killed in what became known as the '' diamond crash '' of t-38 talon aircraft which the squadron had flown since 1974 partially as a result of that accident , the squadron switched to the f-16a , and sat out the 1982 airshow season and spent that year retraining and transitioning over to the new aircraft to ready themselves for the 1983 season beginning in june 1982 , the f-16 thunderbirds were led by major jim latham other than those modifications , the aircraft are taken from the standard usaf inventory as production fighters , and can be returned to an operational squadron in short order without any major modification they also operated the two-seat f-16b during this time for training new pilots and for vip flights , these being replaced by the f-16d when the rest of the squadron transitioned to the f-16c ; lockheed martin f-16c/d fighting falcon ( block 32 ) : the block 32h/j aircraft currently assigned to the thunderbirds were built in 1986 and 1987 , and operated by the thunderbirds from 1992 to 2008 additionally , the more powerful pratt & whitney f100 engine adds an additional of thrust diamond : historically , as thunderbirds 1 through 4 lift off , the slot aircraft slips immediately into position behind 1 to create the signature diamond formation thanks to the 2009 upgrade to the block 52 , the diamond now has more than enough thrust to continue to climb straight up into their first maneuver , the diamond loop much of the thunderbirds ' display alternates between maneuvers performed by the diamond , and those performed by the solos they have a total of eight different formations : the diamond , delta , stinger , arrowhead , line-abreast , trail , echelon and the five card they perform formation loops and rolls or transitions from one formation to another some of their maneuvers include both solo aircraft at once , such as opposing passes ( passing in close proximity to each other ) and mirror formations ( two aircraft being flown back-to-back in the calypso pass or belly-to-belly ) in fact , the number 5 on this aircraft is painted upside-down , and thus appears right-side-up for much of the routine one of the thunderbirds ' standing engagements is the annual commencement ceremony at the united states air force academy in colorado springs on 19 september 1985 , the usaf air demonstration squadron was consolidated by air force historical research agency ( afhra ) with the 30th bombardment squadron , a unit which was organized on 13 june 1917 during its operational history , the 30th served in world war i as a training unit in france , its mission to train fighter pilots to go into combat on the western front during the korean war , the 30th attacked north korean targets with b-29 superfortresses present-day usaf thunderbirds carry the lineage , history , and honors of the 30th on active duty because the thunderjet was a single-seat fighter , a two-seat t-33 shooting star served as the

airshows due to a catastrophic structural failure of the no the f-100d super sabre was retained through the 1968 season in 1969 , the squadron re-equipped with the front-line f-4e phantom , which it flew until 1973 , the only time the thunderbirds would fly jets similar to those of the blue angels as it was the standard fighter for both services in the 1960s and 1970s five t-38s used the same
