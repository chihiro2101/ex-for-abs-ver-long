fischer black ( 1972 ) developed another version of capm , called black capm or zero-beta capm , that does not assume the existence of a riskless asset the rate at which future cash flows produced by the asset should be discounted given that asset 's relative riskiness thus , a more risky stock will have a higher beta and will be discounted at a higher rate ; less sensitive stocks will have lower betas and be discounted at a lower rate given the accepted concave utility function , the capm is consistent with intuition—investors ( should ) require a higher return for holding a more risky asset market risk , the market as a whole , by definition , has a beta of one the risk of a portfolio comprises systematic risk , also known as undiversifiable risk , and specific risk which is also known as idiosyncratic risk or diversifiable risk systematic risk refers to the risk common to all securities—i.e unsystematic risk is the risk associated with individual assets unsystematic risk can be diversified away to smaller levels by including a greater number of assets in the portfolio ( specific risks '' average out '' ) depending on the market , a portfolio of approximately 30–40 securities in developed markets such as the uk or us will render the portfolio sufficiently diversified such that risk exposure is limited to systematic risk only a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk , as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model therefore , the required return on an asset , that is , the return that compensates for risk taken , must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context—i.e its contribution to overall portfolio riskiness—as opposed to its '' stand alone risk '' in the capm context , portfolio risk is represented by higher variance i.e the capm assumes that the risk-return profile of a portfolio can be optimized—an optimal portfolio displays the lowest possible level of risk for its level of return can lend and borrow unlimited amounts under the risk free rate of interest ) in practice , such a market portfolio is unobservable and people usually substitute a stock index as a proxy for the true market portfolio empirical tests show market anomalies like the size and value effect that can not be explained by the capm the treynor capital asset pricing model , journal of investment management , vol ( 1970 ) risk , return , and equilibrium : a general single-period theory of asset selection and capital-market equilibrium a final version was published in 1999 , in asset pricing and portfolio performance : models , strategy and performance metrics
