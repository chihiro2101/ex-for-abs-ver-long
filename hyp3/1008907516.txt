despite the increase in ivr technology during the 1970s , the technology was considered complex and expensive for automating tasks in call centers the first commercial application of ivr was an order entry inventory control system designed and developed by steven schmidt in 1973 early voice response systems were dsp technology based and limited to small vocabularies at that time , a system could store digitized speech on disk , play the appropriate spoken message , and process the human 's dtmf response as call centers began to migrate to multimedia in the late 1990s , companies started to invest in computer telephony integration ( cti ) with ivr systems dtmf decoding and speech recognition are used to interpret the caller 's response to voice prompts an ivr can play announcements and request an input from the caller this information can be used to profile the caller and route the call to an agent with a particular skill set ) interactive voice response can be used to front-end a call center operation by identifying the needs of the caller account numbers from the ivr are often compared to caller id data for security reasons and additional ivr responses are required if the caller id does not match the account record the ability to use xml-driven applications allows a web server to act as the application server , freeing the ivr developer to focus on the call flow a mixed dialogue approach involves shifting from open-ended to directed dialogue or vice versa within the same interaction , as one type of prompt may be more effective in a given situation higher level ivr development tools are available to further simplify the application development process in addition , these tools normally provide extension mechanisms for software integration , such as an http interface to a website and a java interface for connecting to a database arus increase the number of information calls handled and provide consistent quality in information retrieval when an ivr system answers multiple phone numbers , the use of dnis ensures that the correct application and language is executed the system may obtain caller line identification ( cli ) data from the network to help identify or authenticate the caller in a system wherein individual customers may have a different status , the service will automatically prioritize the individual 's call and move customers to the front of a specific queue ivr can be used to provide a more sophisticated voice mail experience to the caller the caller will respond to questions in their preferred language and their responses will be logged into a database and possibly recorded at the same time to confirm authenticity this is information that could easily be handled by a person but the ivr system is used to preserve privacy and avoid potential embarrassment of sensitive information or test results it may also be used to identify the caller , using technology such as iris scan or other biometric means ivr applications can also be hosted on the public network , without contact center integration it is also possible to deploy two-prong ivr services where the initial ivr application is used to route the call to the appropriate contact center
