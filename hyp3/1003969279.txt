the history of group dynamics ( or group processes ) has a consistent , underlying premise : 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts ' a social group is an entity that has qualities which can not be understood just by studying the individuals that make up the group ( the proposition remains questionable , since modern biologists and game theorists do look to explain the 'structural laws of the whole ' in terms of 'the way the elements fit together ' eventually , the social psychology kurt lewin ( 1890–1947 ) coined the term group dynamics to describe the positive and negative forces within groups of people in 1945 , he established the group dynamics research center at the massachusetts institute of technology , the first institute devoted explicitly to the study of group dynamics as humans social environments became more complex , they acquired adaptations by way of group dynamics that enhance survival examples include mechanisms for dealing with status , reciprocity , identifying cheaters , ostracism , altruism , group decision , leadership , and intergroup relations also , a combination of evolution and game theory has been used to explain the development and maintenance of cooperative behavior between individuals in a group gustave le bon was a french social psychologist whose seminal study , the crowd : a study of the popular mind ( 1896 ) led to the development of group psychology the british psychologist william mcdougall in his work the group mind ( 1920 ) researched the dynamics of groups of various sizes and degrees of organization he coined the term group dynamics to describe the way groups and individuals act and react to changing circumstances william schutz ( 1958 , 1966 ) looked at interpersonal relations as stage-developmental , inclusion ( am i included ? ) , control ( who is top dog here ? ) , and affection ( do i belong here ? ) schutz sees groups resolving each issue in turn in order to be able to progress to the next stage conversely , a struggling group can devolve to an earlier stage , if unable to resolve outstanding issues at its present stage yalom , the theory and practice of group psychotherapy , third edition , basic books ( 1985 ) , hardback , bion 's experiences are reported in his published books , especially experiences in groups this model refers to the overall pattern of the group , but of course individuals within a group work in different ways hackman proposed five conditions that increase the chance that groups will be successful supportive context : which occurs in groups nested in larger groups ( e.g intragroup dynamics ( also referred to as ingroup- , within-group , or commonly just ‘ group dynamics ’ ) are the underlying processes that give rise to a set of norms , roles , relations , and common goals that characterize a particular social group amongst the members of a group , there is a state of interdependence , through which the behaviours , attitudes , opinions , and experiences of each member are collectively influenced by the other group members in many fields of research , there is an interest in understanding how group dynamics influence individual behaviour , attitudes , and opinions the dynamics of a particular group depend on how one defines the boundaries of the group often , there are distinct subgroups within a more broadly defined group for each of these groups , there are distinct dynamics that can be discussed so to say , a level of psychological distinctiveness is necessary for group formation new york : harper group membership , allocated roles ) or prior experience working together however , joining a group may also cost an individual time , effort , and personal resources as they may conform to social pressures and strive to reap the benefits that may be offered by the group the minimax principle is a part of social exchange theory that states that people will join and remain in a group that can provide them with the maximum amount of valuable rewards while at the same time , ensuring the minimum amount of costs to themselves however , this does not necessarily mean that a person will join a group simply because the reward/cost ratio seems attractive according to howard kelley and john thibaut , a group may be attractive to us in terms of costs and benefits , but that attractiveness alone does not determine whether or not we will join the group instead , our decision is based on two factors : our comparison level , and our comparison level for alternatives in john thibaut and harold kelley 's social exchange theory , comparison level is the standard by which an individual will evaluate the desirability of becoming a member of the group and forming new social relationships within the group to determine whether people will actually join or leave a group , the value of other , alternative groups needs to be taken into account this comparison level for alternatives is the standard by which an individual will evaluate the quality of the group in comparison to other groups the individual has the opportunity to join thiabaut and kelley stated that the '' comparison level for alternatives can be defined informally as the lowest level of outcomes a member will accept in the light of available alternative opportunities examples of groups to be sorted were a sports team , a family , people at a bus stop and women therefore , it seems that individuals intuitively define aggregations of individuals in this way a social group is characterized by a formally organized group of individuals who are not as emotionally involved with each other as those in a primary group further , social groups do not have as stable memberships , since members are able to leave their social group and join new groups the goals of social groups are often task-oriented as opposed to relationship-oriented examples of social groups include coworkers , clubs , and sports teams collectives are characterized by large groups of individuals who display similar actions or outlooks examples of collectives include a flash mob , an audience at a movie , and a crowd watching a building burn for this reason , categories can appear to be higher in entitativity and essentialism than primary , social , and collective groups the degree of entitativity that a group has is influenced by whether a collection of individuals experience the same fate , display similarities , and are close in proximity group membership and social identity the social group is a critical source of information about individual identity in contrast , one 's social identity is defined by his or her group membership , and the general characteristics ( or prototypes ) that define the group and differentiate it from others instead , we make evaluations that are self-enhancing , emphasizing the positive qualities of our own group ( see ingroup bias ) one 's collective self may offer a balance between these two desires group cohesion , as a scientifically studied property of groups , is commonly associated with kurt lewin and his student , leon festinger before lewin and festinger , there were , of course , descriptions of a very similar group property for example , emile durkheim described two forms of solidarity ( mechanical and organic ) , which created a sense of collective conscious and an emotion-based sense of community individuals tend to upgrade likeable in-group members and deviate from unlikeable group members , making them a separate outgroup this phenomenon has been later accounted for by subjective group dynamics theory according to this theory , people derogate socially undesirable ( deviant ) ingroup members relative to outgroup members , because they give a bad image of the ingroup and jeopardize people 's social identity they also tended to judge the group as a whole in an increasingly less positive manner after they became full members while many norms are widespread throughout society , groups may develop their own norms that members must learn when they join the group saying thank you after someone does a favour for you ) proscriptive norms : actions that group members should not do ; prohibitive ( e.g analysing the intermember relations aspect of a group can highlight the degree centrality of each member in the group , which can lead to a better understanding of the roles of certain group ( e.g social orientation theory considers the way a person approaches social situations there have been several strategies developed for reducing the tension , bias , prejudice , and conflict between social groups
