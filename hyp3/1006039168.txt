zirconium is one of the main components of zircon crystals , currently the oldest known minerals in the earth 's crust many later transition metals , such as rhodium , are very commonly used in jewelry due to the fact that they are incredibly shiny this period is known to have a large number of exceptions to the madelung rule it is an alkali metal , the most reactive group in the periodic table , having properties and similarities with both other alkali metals and other period 5 elements for example , rubidium has 5 electron shells , a property found in all other period 5 elements , whereas its electron configuration 's ending is similar to all other alkali metals : s 1 rubidium is very susceptible to redox in air , similar to most of the other alkali metals , so it readily transforms into rubidium oxide , a yellow solid with the chemical formula rb 2 o it is an alkaline earth metal , a relatively reactive group , although not nearly as reactive as the alkali metals like rubidium , it has 5 electron shells or energy levels , and in accordance with the madelung rule it has two electrons in its 5s subshell if it does come in contact with water , though , it will combine with the atoms of both oxygen and hydrogen to form strontium hydroxide and pure hydrogen gas which quickly diffuses in the air in addition , strontium , like rubidium , redox in air and turns a yellow color yttrium is a chemical element with symbol y and atomic number 39 it is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the lanthanides and it has often been classified as a '' rare earth element '' yttrium is almost always found combined with the lanthanides in rare earth minerals and is never found in nature as a free element yttrium has no known biological role , and exposure to yttrium compounds can cause lung disease in humans zirconium is a chemical element with the symbol zr and atomic number 40 it is a lustrous , gray-white , strong transition metal that resembles titanium zirconium is mainly used as a refractory and opacifier , although minor amounts are used as alloying agent for its strong resistance to corrosion niobium , or columbium , is a chemical element with the symbol nb and atomic number 41 niobium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of the element tantalum , and the two are therefore difficult to distinguish the english chemistcharles hatchett reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 , and named it columbium the german chemist heinrich rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element , which he named niobium in 1864 and 1865 , a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element ( as distinguished from tantalum ) , and for a century both names were used interchangeably it was not until the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially niobium is used mostly in alloys , the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines other applications of niobium include its use in welding , nuclear industries , electronics , optics , numismatics and jewelry the free element , which is a silvery metal , has the sixth-highest melting point of any element it readily forms hard , stable carbides , and for this reason it is often used in high-strength steel alloys industrially , molybdenum compounds are used in high-pressure and high-temperature applications , as pigments and catalysis most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water , but the molybdate ion moo 4 2− is soluble and forms when molybdenum-containing minerals are in contact with oxygen and water technetium is the chemical element with atomic number 43 and symbol tc it is the lowest atomic number element without any stable isotopes ; every form of it is radioactive many of technetium 's properties were predicted by dmitri mendeleev before the element was discovered in 1937 technetium ( specifically the technetium-97 isotope ) became the first predominantly artificial element to be produced , hence its name ( from the greek , meaning '' artificial '' ) like the other metals of the platinum group , ruthenium is inert to most chemicals ruthenium usually occurs as a minor component of platinum ores and its annual production is only about 12 tonnes worldwide most ruthenium is used for wear-resistant electrical contacts and the production of thick-film resistors rhodium is a chemical element that is a rare , silvery-white , hard , and chemically inert transition metal and a member of the platinum group indium is a chemical element with the symbol in and atomic number 49 tin is a chemical element with the symbol sn ( for and atomic number 50 pewter , which is an alloy of 85–90 % tin with the remainder commonly consisting of copper , antimony and lead , was used for tableware from the bronze age until the 20th century tellurium is a chemical element that has the symbol te and atomic number 52
