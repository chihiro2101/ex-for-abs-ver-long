there are two dimensions in aiming a weapon : in the horizontal plane ( azimuth ) ; and in the vertical plane ( elevation ) , which is governed by the distance ( range ) to the target and the energy of the propelling charge nato defines indirect fire as '' fire delivered at a target which can not be seen by the aimer hence indirect fire means applying 'firing data ' to azimuth and elevation sights and laying these sights indirect fire can be used when the target is visible from the firing position indirect fire is most commonly associated with field artillery ( although field artillery was originally and until after world war i a direct fire weapon , hence the bullet-shields fitted to the carriages of guns such as the famous m1897 75 & nbsp ; mm ) and mortars it is also used with naval guns against shore targets , sometimes with machine guns , and has been used with tank and anti-tank guns and by anti-aircraft guns against surface targets it is reasonable to assume that original purpose of indirect fire was to enable fire from a 'covered position ' , one where gunners can not be seen and engaged by their enemies ( that and as the range of artillery lengthened , it was impossible to see the target past all the intervening terrain ) the concealment aspect remains important , but from world war i equally important was the capability to concentrate the fire of many artillery batteries at the same target or set of targets the physical laws of ballistics means that guns firing larger and heavier projectile can send them further than smaller-calibre guns firing lighter shells during world war i , covered positions moved further back and indirect fire evolved to allow any point within range to be attacked , firepower mobility , without moving the firers it is also reasonable conjecture that if these mortars were used from inside fortifications their targets may have been invisible to them and therefore met the definition of indirect fire it could also be argued that niccol√≤ tartaglia 's invention of the gunner 's quadrant ( see clinometer ) in the 16th century introduced indirect fire guns because it enabled gunlaying by instrument instead of line of sight guk , published field artillery fire from covered positions that described a better method of indirect laying ( instead of aiming points in line with the target ) the british used improvised gun arcs with howitzers ; the sighting arrangements used by the boers with their german and french guns is unclear indirect fire needs a command and control arrangement to allot guns to targets and direct their fire the other method was to set the sight at the actual grid bearing in which the gun was oriented , and firing data was the actual bearing to the target
