governments on both sides of politics , well aware of the immense stretches of uninhabitable desert that separated the small productive regions of australia , regarded air transport as a matter of national importance ( as did the governments of other geographically large nations , such as the soviet union and the united states ) in the words of director general of civil aviation ab corbett , a nation which refuses to use flying in its national life must necessarily today be a backward and defenceless nation however , after 1939 and especially after japan 's invasion of the islands to the north in 1941 , civil aviation was sacrificed to military needs by the end of the war , there were only nine domestic airlines remaining , eight smaller regional concerns and australian national airways ( ana ) , a conglomerate owned by british and australian shipping interests which had a virtual monopoly on the major trunk routes and received 85 % of all government air transport subsidies in august 1945 , only two days after the end of world war ii , the australian parliament passed the australian national airways bill , which set up the australian national airways commission ( anac ) and charged it with the task of reconstructing the nation 's air transport industry in keeping with the labor government 's socialist leanings , the bill declared that the licenses of private operators would lapse for those routes that were adequately serviced by the national carrier however , a legal challenge , backed by the liberal opposition and business interests generally , was successful and in december 1945 , the high court ruled that the commonwealth did not have the power to prevent the issue of airline licenses to private companies much of the press objected strongly to the setting up of a public airline network , seeing it as a form of socialisation by stealth the commissioners themselves were prominent high-achievers , including the director-general of civil aviation , the deputy director , a labor party luminary and former member of the commonwealth bank board , the director-general of posts and telegraphs , and the assistant secretary of the treasury he

chairman of the anac had the monopoly provision been retained the commission decided on the name '' trans-australia airlines '' , applied to the treasury for a preliminary advance of £10,000 and set about making plans , recruiting staff , and purchasing equipment reg ansett , proprietor of the small victorian company ansett airways was quick to offer to get the new airline off to a flying start by selling his entire operation to the anac as a going concern , including ( if desired ) his own services as managing agent brain had 22 years of pioneering aviation experience behind him and was regarded as the man behind qantas ' reputation for technical excellence taa acquired its first two aircraft in mid-june 1946 , both douglas dc-3s a dozen more dc-3s would be added over the next few months , all ex-royal australian air force aircraft originally bought by the australian government under lend-lease he later wrote : : to my utter astonishment arthur coles , after the expected pep-talk about the dc-4 assignment , said he was relying on me to find out what new equipment was being developed that would enable us to offer our passengers a better product than our established rival , at a competitive price east-coast services were continually expanded and taa soon earned its title as a true 'trans australian ' airline with services to perth on the west coast of the continent , using douglas dc-4 aircraft although government-owned , the menzies government ( 1949–66 ) of the 1950s had a philosophical leaning towards the needs of the privately owned ansett and the requirements of taa suffered as a result the controversial two airlines policy was introduced and effectively seriously limited growth and expansion opportunities for the airlines without government approval the policy was so strict that even newly purchased identical aircraft ( one from each airline ) were required on their delivery flights to enter australian airspace at exactly the same time
