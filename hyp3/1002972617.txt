the camp david accords were the result of 14 months of diplomatic efforts by egypt , israel , and the united states that began after jimmy carter became president heroic diplomacy : sadat , kissinger , carter , begin , and the quest for arab–israeli peace 228–229 the efforts initially focused on a comprehensive resolution of disputes between israel and the arab countries , gradually evolving into a search for a bilateral agreement between israel and egypt 229–228 '' upon assuming office on 20 january 1977 , president carter moved to rejuvenate the middle east peace process that had stalled throughout the 1976 presidential campaign in the united states the yom kippur war further complicated efforts to achieve the objectives written in united nations security council resolution 242 israel 's prime minister yitzhak rabin and his successor , menachem begin , were both skeptical of an international conference from zbigniew brzezinski , power and principle : memoirs of the national security advisor 1977–1981 , ( new york : farrar , straus and giroux , 1983 ) , p.88 9 also refused to come to the united states and only agreed to meet with carter in geneva sadat first spoke about the possibility of peace with israel in february 1971 and egypt was the initiator of many moves in the 1970s ten days after his speech , sadat arrived for the groundbreaking three-day visit , which launched the first peace process between israel and an arab state that speech led the begin government to declare that , if israel thought that sadat would accept an invitation , israel would invite him in sadat 's knesset speech he talked about his views on peace , the status of israeli occupied territories , and the palestinian refugee problem like sadat , begin also saw many reasons why bilateral talks would be in his country 's best interests it would afford israel the opportunity to negotiate only with egypt instead of with a larger arab delegation that might try to use its size to make unwelcome or unacceptable demands israel felt egypt could help protect israel from other arabs and eastern communists indeed , in a sense egypt and israel were ganging up to push carter off his geneva track the basic message of sadat 's speech at the knesset were the request for the implementation of resolutions 242 and 338 sadat 's visit was the first step to negotiations such as the preliminary cairo conference in december 1977 a mechanism had yet to be created for israel and egypt to pursue the talks begun by sadat and begin in jerusalem the egyptian president suggested to begin that israel place a secret representative in the american embassy in cairo with american '' cover , '' the true identity of the israeli , who would liaise between the egyptian and israeli leaders , would be known only to the american ambassador in cairo accompanied by their capable negotiating teams and with their respective interests in mind , both leaders converged on camp david for 13 days of tense and dramatic negotiations from 5 to 17 september 1978 carter 's advisers insisted on the establishment of an egyptian-israeli agreement which would lead to an eventual solution to the palestine issue however , carter felt they were not '' aiming high enough '' and was interested in the establishment of a written '' land for peace '' agreement with israel returning the sinai peninsula and west bank or he could have refused to continue the talks , reported the reasons for their failure , and allowed begin to bear the brunt of the blame likewise , the israeli delegation had a stable of excellent talent in ministers dayan and weizman and legal experts dr an eventual scrap of negotiations by either leader would have proven disastrous , resulting in taking the blame for the summit 's failure as well as a disassociation from the white house the agreements and the peace treaty were both accompanied by '' side-letters '' of understanding between egypt and the u.s and israel and the u.s '' jimmy carter library and museum the first part of the framework was to establish an autonomous self-governing authority in the west bank and the gaza strip and to fully implement resolution 242 this full autonomy was to be discussed with the participation of israel , egypt , jordan and the palestinians this was not the comprehensive peace that kissinger , ford , carter , or sadat had in mind during the previous american presidential transition it was less clear than the agreements concerning the sinai , and was later interpreted differently by israel , egypt , and the united states gold , 175 the second part of the framework dealt with egyptian–israeli relations , the real content worked out in the second egypt—israel framework egypt , israel , jordan and the representatives of the palestinian people should participate in negotiations on the resolution of the palestinian problem in all its aspects ) egypt , israel , and jordan will agree on the modalities for establishing elected self-governing authority in the west bank and gaza the delegations of egypt and jordan may include palestinians from the west bank and gaza or other palestinians as mutually agreed the parties will negotiate an agreement which will define the powers and responsibilities of the self-governing authority to be exercised in the west bank and gaza the negotiations shall be based on all the provisions and principles of un security council resolution 242 the part of the camp david accords regarding the palestinian future and all similar ones were declared invalid with the most powerful of the arab militaries and a history of leadership in the arab world under nasser , egypt had more leverage than any of the other arab states to advance arab interests one of carter 's regrets was allowing sadat to claim that he could speak for hussein if jordan refused to join the talks , but by then the damage was done to the jordanians
