the word individuation occurs with different meanings and connotations in different fields philosophically , '' individuation '' expresses the general idea of how a thing is identified as an individual thing that '' is not something else '' this includes how an individual person is held to be different from other elements in the world and how a person is distinct from other persons other psychoanalytic theorists describe it as the stage where an individual transcends group attachment and narcissistic self-absorption most data protection and privacy laws turn on the identifiability of an individual as the threshold criterion for when data subjects will need legal protection however privacy advocates argue privacy harms can also arise from the ability to disambiguate or ‘ single out ’ a person doing so enables the person , at an individual level , to be tracked , profiled , targeted , contacted , or subject to a decision or action which impacts them - even if their ‘ identity ’ is not known ( or knowable ) in his view , the mere difference in location suffices to make two systems different , with each of the two states having its own real physical state , independent of the state of the other according to jungian psychology , individuation is a process of psychological integration individuation is a process of transformation whereby the personal and collective unconscious are brought into consciousness ( e.g individuation is an ever-incomplete process , always leaving a '' pre-individual '' left over , which makes possible future individuations furthermore , individuation always creates both an individual subject and a collective subject , which individuate themselves concurrently the i is essentially a process , not a state , and this process is an in-dividuation — it is a process of psychic individuation these retentional apparatuses arise from a technical system which is the condition of the encounter of the i and the we — the individuation of the i and the we is in this respect also the individuation of the technical system
