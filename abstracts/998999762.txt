ariane 3 was a european expendable launch vehicle , which was used for eleven launches between 1984 and 1989 . it was a member of the ariane family of rockets . the principal manufacturer for the ariane 3 was a√©rospatiale , while the lead agency for its development was the centre national d'etudes spatiales ( cnes ) . development of the ariane 3 was authorised in july 1979 , months prior to the ariane 1 's first flight . drawing heavily upon both the design and infrastructure of the ariane 1 , the new launcher was concurrently developed alongside the ariane 2 , with which it shared much of its design . it represented an advancement of the ariane 1 rather than a replacement , but was capable of lifting even heavier payloads into geostationary transfer orbit ( gto ) as well as launching two satellites via one launch . developed largely within a two year window , the ariane 3 performed its maiden flight on 4 august 1984 , actually flying in advance of its ariane 2 sibling . during its brief service life , having performed its final launch on 12 july 1989 , the ariane family had become increasingly commercially competitive , becoming the market leading heavy launch vehicle in the world by the late 1980s .
