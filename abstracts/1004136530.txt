olaf ii haraldsson ( c . 995 â€“ 29 july 1030 ) , later known as saint olaf ( and traditionally as st . olave ) , was king of norway from 1015 to 1028 . son of harald grenske , a petty king in vestfold , norway , he was posthumously given the title rex perpetuus norvegiae and canonised at nidaros ( trondheim ) by bishop grimkell , one year after his death in the battle of stiklestad on 29 july 1030 . his remains were enshrined in nidaros cathedral , built over his burial site . his sainthood encouraged the widespread adoption of christianity by scandinavia 's vikings/norsemen . pope alexander iii confirmed olaf 's local canonisation in 1164 , making him a universally recognised saint of the roman catholic church . he became an equally important saint of the eastern orthodox church ( feast day 29 july ) and one of the last famous saints before the great schism . following the reformation he was a commemorated historical figure among some members of the lutheran and anglican communions . the saga of olav haraldsson and the legend of olaf the saint became central to a national identity . especially during the period of romantic nationalism , olaf was a symbol of norwegian independence and pride . saint olaf is symbolised by the axe in norway 's coat of arms and olsok ( 29 july ) is still his day of celebration . many christian institutions with scandinavian links as well as norway 's order of st . olav are named after him .
