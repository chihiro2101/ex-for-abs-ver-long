a surface-to-air missile ( sam ) , also known as a ground-to-air missile ( gtam ) or surface-to-air guided weapon ( sagw ) , is a missile designed to be launched from the ground to destroy aircraft or other missiles . it is one type of antiaircraft warfare ; in modern armed forces , missiles have replaced most other forms of dedicated anti-aircraft weapons , with anti-aircraft guns pushed into specialized roles . the first serious attempts at sam development took place during world war ii , although no operational systems were introduced . further development in the 1940s and 1950s led to operational systems being introduced by most major forces during the second half of the 1950s . smaller systems , suitable for close-range work , evolved through the 1960s and 1970s , to modern systems that are man-portable . shipborne systems followed the evolution of land-based models , starting with long-range weapons and steadily evolving toward smaller designs to provide a layered defence . this evolution of design increasingly pushed gun-based systems into the shortest-range roles . the american nike ajax was the first operational guided missile sam system , and the soviet union 's s-75 dvina was the most-produced sam . widely used modern examples include the patriot and s-300 wide-area systems , sm-6 and mbda aster missile naval missiles , and short-range man-portable systems like the stinger and strela-3 .
