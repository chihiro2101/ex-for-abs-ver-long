they are large trees , reaching heights of tall with trunk diameters of when mature . firs can be distinguished from other members of the pine family by the way in which their needle-like leaves are attached singly to the branches with a base resembling a suction cup , and by their cones , which , like those of true cedars ( cedrus ) , stand upright on the branches like candles and disintegrate at maturity . identification of the different species is based on the size and arrangement of the leaves , the size and shape of the cones , and whether the bract scales of the cones are long and exserted , or short and hidden inside the cone .
