proof theory is a major branch according to wang ( 1981 ) , pp . 3â€“4 , proof theory is one of four domains mathematical logic , together with model theory , axiomatic set theory , and recursion theory . barwise ( 1978 ) consists of four corresponding parts , with part d being about '' proof theory and constructive mathematics '' . of mathematical logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects , facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques . proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as plain lists , boxed lists , or trees , which are constructed according to the axioms and rule of inference of the logical system . as such , proof theory is syntactic in nature , in contrast to model theory , which is semantic in nature . some of the major areas of proof theory include structural proof theory , ordinal analysis , provability logic , reverse mathematics , proof mining , automated theorem proving , and proof complexity . much research also focuses on applications in computer science , linguistics , and philosophy .
