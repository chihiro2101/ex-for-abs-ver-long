the constitution of the people 's republic of china is nominally the supreme law of the people 's republic of china . it was adopted by the 5th national people 's congress on december 4 , 1982 , with further revisions about every five years . it is the fourth constitution in the country 's history , superseding the 1954 constitution , the 1975 constitution , and the 1978 constitution . though technically the '' supreme legal authority '' and '' fundamental law of the state '' , the ruling chinese communist party ( ccp ) has a documented history of violating many of the constitution 's provisions and censoring calls for greater adherence to it . furthermore , claims of violations of constitutional rights can not be used in chinese courts , and the national people 's congress constitution and law committee , the legislative committee responsible for constitutional review , has never ruled a law or regulation unconstitutional .
