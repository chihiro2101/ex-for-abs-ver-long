following the november 2015 paris attacks , a cartoon in the daily mail by stanley mcmurtry ( '' mac '' ) linked the european migrant crisis ( with a focus on syria in particular ) to the terrorist attacks , and criticised the european union immigration laws for allowing islamist radicals to gain easy access into the united kingdom . despite being compared to nazi propaganda by the new york times , and criticised as '' reckless xenophobia , '' and racist , the cartoon received praise on the mail online website . a daily mail spokesperson told the independent : '' we are not going to dignify these absurd comments which wilfully misrepresent this cartoon apart from to say that we have not received a single complaint from any reader '' .
