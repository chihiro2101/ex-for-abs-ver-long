cartilage is a resilient and smooth elastic fiber , rubber-like padding that covers and protects the ends of long bones at the joints and nerves , and is a structural component of the rib cage , the ear , the nose , the bronchial tubes , the intervertebral discs , and many other body components . it is not as hard and rigid as bone , but it is much stiffer and much less flexible than muscle . the matrix of cartilage is made up of glycosaminoglycans , proteoglycans , collagen fibers and , sometimes , elastin . because of its rigidity , cartilage often serves the purpose of holding tubes open in the body . examples include the rings of the trachea , such as the cricoid cartilage and carina . cartilage is composed of specialized cells called chondrocytes that produce a large amount of collagenous extracellular matrix , abundant ground substance that is rich in proteoglycan and elastin fibers . cartilage is classified in three types , elastic cartilage , hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage , which differ in relative amounts of collagen and proteoglycan . cartilage does not contain blood vessels ( it is avascular ) or nerves ( it is aneural ) . some fibrocartilage such as the meniscus of the knee does however have blood supply in part . nutrition is supplied to the chondrocytes by diffusion . the compression of the articular cartilage or flexion of the elastic cartilage generates fluid flow , which assists the diffusion of nutrients to the chondrocytes . compared to other connective tissues , cartilage has a very slow turnover of its extracellular matrix and is documented to repair at only a very slow rate relative to other tissues .
