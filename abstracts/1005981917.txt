pointillism , is a technique of painting in which small , distinct dots of color are applied in patterns to form an image . georges seurat and paul signac developed the technique in 1886 , branching from impressionism . the term '' pointillism '' was coined by art critics in the late 1880s to ridicule the works of these artists , but is now used without its earlier mocking connotation . the movement seurat began with this technique is known as neo-impressionism . the divisionism used a similar technique of patterns to form images , though with larger cube-like brushstrokes . ruhrberg , karl .
