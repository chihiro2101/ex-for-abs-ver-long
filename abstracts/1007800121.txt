the catacombs of rome are ancient catacombs , underground burial places in and around rome , of which there are at least forty , some rediscovered only in recent decades . though most famous for christian burials , either in separate catacombs or mixed together , jews and also adherents of a variety of pagan roman religions were buried in catacombs , beginning in the 2nd century ad , toynbee : 39â€“40 . occasioned by the ancient roman ban on burials within a city , and also as a response to overcrowding and shortage of land . the most extensive and perhaps the best known is the christian catacomb of callixtus located near the park of the caffarella , but there are other sites , both christian and not , scattered around the city , some of which are now engulfed in the modern urban sprawl . the christian catacombs are extremely important for the history of early christian art , as they contain the great majority of examples from before about 400 ad , in fresco and sculpture , as well as gold glass medallions ( these , like most bodies , have been removed ) . the jews catacombs are similarly important for the study of jewish culture at this early period .
