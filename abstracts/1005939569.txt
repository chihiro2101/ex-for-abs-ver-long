the shadow mask is one of the two technologies used in the manufacture of cathode-ray tube ( crt ) televisions and computer monitors which produce clear , focused color images . the other approach is the aperture grille , better known by its trade name , trinitron . all early color televisions and the majority of crt computer monitors used shadow mask technology . both of these technologies are largely obsolete , having been increasingly replaced since the 1990s by the liquid-crystal display ( lcd ) . a shadow mask is a metal plate punched with tiny holes that separate the colored phosphors in the layer behind the front glass of the screen . shadow masks are made by photochemical machining , a technique that allows for the drilling of small holes on metal sheets . three electron guns at the back of the screen sweep across the mask , with the beams only reaching the screen if they pass through the holes . as the guns are physically separated at the back of the tube , their beams approach the mask from three slightly different angles , so after passing through the holes they hit slightly different locations on the screen . the screen is patterned with dots of colored phosphor positioned so that each can only be hit by one of the beams coming from the three electron guns . for instance , the blue phosphor dots are hit by the beam from the '' blue gun '' after passing through a particular hole in the mask . the other two guns do the same for the red and green dots . this arrangement allows the three guns to address the individual dot colors on the screen , even though their beams are much too large and too poorly aimed to do so without the mask in place . a red , a green , and a blue phosphor are generally arranged in a triangle shape ( sometimes called a '' triad '' ) . for television use , modern displays ( starting in the late 1960s ) use rectangular slots instead of circular holes , improving brightness . this variation is sometimes referred to as a slot mask .
