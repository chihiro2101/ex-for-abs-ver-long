thumb the pentium ii brand refers to intel 's sixth-generation microarchitecture ( '' p6 '' ) and x86-compatible microprocessors introduced on may 7 , 1997 . containing 7.5 million transistors ( 27.4 million in the case of the mobile dixon with 256 & nbsp ; kb l2 cache ) , the pentium ii featured an improved version of the first p6-generation core of the pentium pro , which contained 5.5 million transistors . however , its l2 cache subsystem was a downgrade when compared to the pentium pros . in 1998 , intel stratified the pentium ii family by releasing the pentium ii-based celeron line of processors for low-end workstations and the pentium ii xeon line for servers and high-end workstations . the celeron was characterized by a reduced or omitted ( in some cases present but disabled ) on-die full-speed l2 cache and a 66 mt/s fsb . the xeon was characterized by a range of full-speed l2 cache ( from 512 & nbsp ; kb to 2048 & nbsp ; kb ) , a 100 & nbsp ; mt/s fsb , a different physical interface ( slot 2 ) , and support for symmetric multiprocessing . in february 1999 , the pentium ii was replaced by the nearly identical pentium iii , which only added the then new sse instruction set . however , the older family would continue to be produced until june 2001 for desktop units , september 2001 for mobile units , and the end of 2003 for embedded devices .
