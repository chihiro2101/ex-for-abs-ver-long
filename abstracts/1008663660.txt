right a swagman ( also called a swaggie , sundowner or tussocker ) was a transient labourer who travelled by foot from farm to farm carrying his belongings in a swag ( bedroll ) . the term originated in australia in the 19th century and was later used in new zealand . swagmen were particularly common in australia during times of economic uncertainty , such as the 1890s and the great depression of the 1930s . many unemployed men travelled the rural areas of australia on foot , their few meagre possessions rolled up and carried in their swag . their swag was frequently referred to as '' matilda '' , hence waltzing matilda refers to walking with their swag . typically , they would seek work in farms and towns they travelled through , and in many cases the farmers , if no permanent work was available , would provide food and shelter in return for some menial task . the figure of the '' jolly swagman '' , represented most famously in banjo paterson 's bush poem '' waltzing matilda '' , became a folk hero in 19th-century australia , and is still seen today as a symbol of anti-authoritarian values that australians considered to be part of the national character .
