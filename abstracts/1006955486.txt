the seven bridges of königsberg is a historically notable problem in mathematics . its negative resolution by leonhard euler in 1736 euler , leonhard ( 1736 ) . '' solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis '' . comment . acad . sci . u . petrop 8 , 128–40 . laid the foundations of graph theory and prefigured the idea of topology . shields provides a discussion of the social significance of euler 's engagement with this popular problem and its significance as an example of ( proto- ) topological understanding applied to everyday life . the city of königsberg in prussia ( now kaliningrad , russia ) was set on both sides of the pregolya , and included two large islands—kneiphof and lomse—which were connected to each other , or to the two mainland portions of the city , by seven bridges . the problem was to devise a walk through the city that would cross each of those bridges once and only once . by way of specifying the logical task unambiguously , solutions involving either reaching an island or mainland bank other than via one of the bridges , or accessing any bridge without crossing to its other end are explicitly unacceptable . euler proved that the problem has no solution . the difficulty he faced was the topology motivation , and of subsequent tests that established this assertion with mathematical rigor .
