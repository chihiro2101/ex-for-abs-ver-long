in combinatorics , ramsey 's theorem , in one of its graph theory forms , states that one will find monochromatic cliques in any graph labeling ( with colours ) of a sufficiently large complete graph . to demonstrate the theorem for two colours ( say , blue and red ) , let r and s be any two positive integers . some authors restrict the values to be greater than one , for example and , thus avoiding a discussion of edge colouring a graph with no edges , while others rephrase the statement of the theorem to require , in a simple graph , either an r-clique or an s-independent set , see or . in this form , the consideration of graphs with one vertex is more natural . ramsey 's theorem states that there exists a least positive integer for which every blue-red edge colouring of the complete graph on vertices contains a blue clique on r vertices or a red clique on s vertices . ( here signifies an integer that depends on both r and s . ) ramsey 's theorem is a foundational result in combinatorics . the first version of this result was proved by f . p . ramsey . this initiated the combinatorial theory now called ramsey theory , that seeks regularity amid disorder : general conditions for the existence of substructures with regular properties . in this application it is a question of the existence of monochromatic subsets , that is , subsets of connected edges of just one colour . an extension of this theorem applies to any finite number of colours , rather than just two . more precisely , the theorem states that for any given number of colours , c , and any given integers n 1 , … , n c , there is a number , r ( n 1 , … , n c ) , such that if the edges of a complete graph of order r ( n 1 , . , n c ) are coloured with c different colours , then for some i between 1 and c , it must contain a complete subgraph of order n i whose edges are all colour i . the special case above has c & thinsp ; & thinsp ; 2 ( and n 1 & thinsp ; & thinsp ; r and n 2 & thinsp ; & thinsp ; s ) .
