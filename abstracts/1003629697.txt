the battle of brienne ( 29 january 1814 ) saw an imperial french army led by emperor napoleon attack prussian and russian forces commanded by prussian field marshal gebhard leberecht von blücher . after heavy fighting that went on into the night , the french seized the château , nearly capturing blücher . however , the french were unable to dislodge the russians from the town of brienne-le-château . napoleon himself , making his first appearance on a battlefield in 1814 , was also nearly captured . very early the next morning , blücher 's troops quietly abandoned the town and retreated to the south , conceding the field to the french . in late december 1813 , two allied armies initially numbering 300,000 men smashed through france 's weak defenses and moved west . by late january , napoleon personally took the field to lead his armies . the french emperor hoped to cripple blücher 's army before it could combine with the main allied army under austrian field marshal karl philipp , prince of schwarzenberg . napoleon 's gamble failed and blücher escaped to join schwarzenberg . three days later , the two allied armies combined their 120,000 men and attacked napoleon in the battle of la rothière .
