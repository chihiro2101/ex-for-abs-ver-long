post-impressionism ( also spelled postimpressionism ) is a predominantly french art movement that developed roughly between 1886 and 1905 , from the last impressionism exhibition to the birth of fauvism . post-impressionism emerged as a reaction against impressionists ' concern for the naturalistic depiction of light and colour . due to its broad emphasis on abstract qualities or symbolic content , post-impressionism encompasses les nabis , neo-impressionism , symbolism , cloisonnism , pont-aven school , and synthetism , along with some later impressionists ' work . the movement was led by paul c√©zanne ( known as father of post-impressionism ) , paul gauguin , vincent van gogh , and georges seurat . metropolitan museum of art timeline , post-impressionism the term post-impressionism was first used by art critic roger fry in 1906 . richard r . brettell , modern art , 1851-1929 : capitalism and representation , oxford university press , 1999 , p . 21 peter morrin , judith zilczer , william c . agee , the advent of modernism . post-impressionism and north american art , 1900-1918 , high museum of art , 1986 critic frank rutter in a review of the salon d'automne published in art news , 15 october 1910 , described othon friesz as a '' post-impressionist leader '' ; there was also an advert for the show the post-impressionists of france . bullen , j . b . post-impressionists in england , p.37 . routledge , 1988 . , three weeks later , roger fry used the term again when he organized the 1910 exhibition , manet and the post-impressionists , defining it as the development of french art since manet . post-impressionists extended impressionism while rejecting its limitations : they continued using vivid colours , often thick application of paint , and real-life subject matter , but were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms , distort form for expressive effect , and use unnatural or arbitrary colour .
