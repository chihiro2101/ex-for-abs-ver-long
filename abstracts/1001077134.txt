religious pluralism is a set of religious world views that hold that one 's religion is not the sole and exclusive source of truth , and thus recognizes that some level of truth and value exists in other religions . as such , religious pluralism goes beyond religious tolerance , which is the condition of peaceful existence between adherents of different religions or religious denominations . within the jewish community there lies a common history , a shared language of prayer , a shared bible and a shared set of rabbinic literature , thus allowing for jews of significantly different world views to share some common values and goals .
