the '' angry young men '' were a group of mostly working- and middle class british playwrights and novelists who became prominent in the 1950s . the group 's leading figures included john osborne and kingsley amis ; other popular figures included john braine , alan sillitoe , and john wain . the phrase was originally coined by the royal court theatre 's press officer in order to promote osborne 's 1956 play look back in anger . it is thought to be derived from the autobiography of leslie paul , founder of the woodcraft folk , whose angry young man was published in 1951 . following the success of the osborne play , the label '' angry young men '' was later applied by british media to describe young writers who were characterised by a disillusionment with traditional british society . the term , always imprecise , began to have less meaning over the years as the writers to whom it was originally applied became more divergent , and many of them dismissed the label as useless .
