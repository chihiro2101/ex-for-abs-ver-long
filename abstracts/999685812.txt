the forth and clyde canal is a canal opened in 1790 , crossing central scotland ; it provided a route for the seagoing vessels of the day between the firth of forth and the firth of clyde at the narrowest part of the scottish lowlands . this allowed navigation from edinburgh on the east coast to the port of glasgow on the west coast . the canal is long and it runs from the river carron at grangemouth to the river clyde at bowling , and had an important basin at port dundas in glasgow . successful in its day , it suffered as the seagoing vessels were built larger and could no longer pass through . the railway age further impaired the success of the canal , and in the 1930s decline had ended in dormancy . the final decision to close the canal in the early 1960s was made due to maintenance costs of bridges crossing the canal exceeding the revenues it brought in . however , subsidies to the rail network were also a cause for its decline and the closure ended the movement of the east-coast forth river fishing fleets across the country to fish the irish sea . the lack of political and financial foresight also removed a historical recreational waterway and potential future revenue generator to the town of grangemouth . unlike the majority of major canals the route through grangemouth was drained and backfilled before 1967 to create a new carriageway for port traffic . the m8 motorway in the eastern approaches to glasgow took over some of the alignment of the canal , but more recent ideas have regenerated the utility of the canal for leisure use .
