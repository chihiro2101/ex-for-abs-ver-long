the genesis nomad , also known as sega nomad , is a handheld game console manufactured by sega and released in north america in october 1995 . the nomad is a portable variation of the sega genesis home video game console ( known as the mega drive outside north america ) . based on the mega jet , a portable version of the home console designed for use on airline flights in japan , nomad was the last handheld console released by sega . in addition to functioning as a portable device , it was designed to be used with a television set via a video port . released late in the genesis era , the nomad had a short lifespan . sold exclusively in north america , the nomad was never officially released worldwide , and employs a regional lockout . sega 's focus on the sega saturn left the nomad under-supported , and the handheld itself was incompatible with several genesis peripherals , including the power base converter , the sega cd , and the 32x . about 1 million units of the nomad were sold , and it is considered a commercial failure . still , it has also received praise for its powerful technical specs , and for being '' the first true 16-bit handheld '' .
