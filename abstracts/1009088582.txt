hydrogen sulfide is the chemical compound with the formula . it is a colorless chalcogen hydride gas with the characteristic foul odor of rotten eggs . it is poisonous , corrosive , and flammable . hydrogen sulfide is often produced from the microbial breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen gas , such as in swamps and sewers ; this process is commonly known as anaerobic digestion which is done by sulfate-reducing microorganisms . also occurs in volcanic gases , natural gas , and in some sources of well water . the human body produces small amounts of and uses it as a signaling molecule . swedish chemist carl wilhelm scheele is credited with having discovered the chemical composition of hydrogen sulfide in 1777 . the british english spelling of this compound is hydrogen sulphide , but this spelling is not recommended by the international union of pure and applied chemistry ( iupac ) or the royal society of chemistry .
