in particle physics , a magnetic monopole is a hypothetical elementary particle that is an isolated magnet with only one magnetic pole ( a north pole without a south pole or vice versa ) . a magnetic monopole would have a net '' magnetic charge '' . modern interest in the concept stems from particle theories , notably the grand unified and superstring theories , which predict their existence . wen , xiao-gang ; witten , edward , electric and magnetic charges in superstring models , nuclear physics b , volume 261 , pp . 651â€“677 s . coleman , the magnetic monopole 50 years later , reprinted in aspects of symmetry magnetism in bar magnets and electromagnets is not caused by magnetic monopoles , and indeed , there is no known experimental or observational evidence that magnetic monopoles exist . some condensed matter systems contain effective ( non-isolated ) magnetic monopole quasiparticle , or contain phenomena that are mathematically analogous to magnetic monopoles .
