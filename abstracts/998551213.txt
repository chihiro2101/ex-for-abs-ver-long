esotropia is a form of strabismus in which one or both eyes turns inward . the condition can be constantly present , or occur intermittently , and can give the affected individual a '' cross-eyed '' appearance . it is the opposite of exotropia and usually involves more severe axis deviation than esophoria . esotropia is sometimes erroneously called '' lazy eye '' , which describes the condition of amblyopiaâ€”a reduction in vision of one or both eyes that is not the result of any pathology of the eye and can not be resolved by the use of corrective lenses . amblyopia can , however , arise as a result of esotropia occurring in childhood : in order to relieve symptoms of diplopia or double vision , the child 's brain will ignore or '' suppress '' the image from the esotropic eye , which when allowed to continue untreated will lead to the development of amblyopia . treatment options for esotropia include glasses to correct refractive errors ( see accommodative esotropia below ) , the use of prisms and/or orthoptic exercises and/or eye surgery . the term is from greek eso meaning '' inward '' and trope meaning '' a turning '' .
