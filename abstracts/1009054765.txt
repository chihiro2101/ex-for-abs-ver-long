the atmospheric engine was invented by thomas newcomen in 1712 , and is often referred to simply as a newcomen engine . the engine was operated by condensing steam drawn into the cylinder , thereby creating a partial vacuum which allowed the atmospheric pressure to push the piston into the cylinder . it was the first practical device to harness steam to produce mechanical work . newcomen engines were used throughout britain and europe , principally to pump water out of mines . hundreds were constructed through the 18th century . james watt 's later engine design was an improved version of the newcomen engine that roughly doubled fuel efficiency . many atmospheric engines were converted to the watt design , for a price which was based on a fraction of the fuel-savings . as a result , watt is today better known than newcomen in relation to the origin of the steam engine .
