a light cruiser is a type of small- or medium-sized warship . the term is a shortening of the phrase '' light armored cruiser '' , describing a small ship that carried armor in the same way as an armored cruiser : a protective belt and deck . prior to this smaller cruisers had been of the protected cruiser model , possessing armored decks only . while lighter and smaller than other contemporary ships they were still true cruisers , retaining the extended radius of action and self-sufficiency to act independently across the world . through their history they served in a variety of roles , primarily as convoy escorts and destroyer command ships , but also as scouts and fleet support vessels for battle fleets .
