the lordship of ireland , sometimes referred to retroactively as norman ireland , was the part of ireland ruled by the king of england ( styled as '' lord of ireland '' ) and controlled by loyal normans in ireland between 1177 and 1542 . the lordship was created as a papal fief following the norman invasion of ireland in 1169–1171 . as the lord of ireland was also the king of england , he was represented locally by a governor , variously known as justiciar , lieutenant , or lord deputy . the kings of england claimed lordship over the whole island , but in reality the king 's rule only ever extended to parts of the island . the rest of the island—known as gaelic ireland—remained under the control of various gaels irish kingdoms or chiefdoms , who were often at war with the anglo-normans . the area under english rule and law grew and shrank over time , and reached its greatest extent in the late 13th and early 14th centuries . the lordship then went into decline , brought on by its invasion by scotland in 1315–18 , the great famine of 1315–17 , and the black death of the 1340s . the fluid political situation and english feudal system allowed a great deal of autonomy for the anglo-norman lords in ireland , who carved out earldoms for themselves and had almost as much authority as some of the native gaelic kings . some anglo-normans became gaelicised and rebelled against the english administration . the english attempted to curb this by passing the statutes of kilkenny ( 1366 ) , which forbade english settlers from taking up irish law , language , custom and dress . the period ended with the creation of the kingdom of ireland in 1542 .
