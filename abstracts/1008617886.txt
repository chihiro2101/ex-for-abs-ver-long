or khukuri , is a type of machete originating from the indian subcontinent , and is traditionally associated with the nepali-speaking gurkha of nepal and india . the knife has a distinct recurve in its blade . it serves multiple purposes as a melee weapon and also as a regular cutting tool throughout most of south asia . the blade has traditionally served the role of a basic utility knife for the gurkha . the kukri is the national weapon of nepal , and consequently is a characteristic weapon of the nepali army . the kukri also sees standard service with various regiments and units within the indian army , such as the assam rifles , the kumaon regiment , the garhwal rifles and the various gorkha regiments . outside of its native region of south asia , the kukri also sees service with the royal gurkha rifles of the british army—a unique regiment that is quite different from the rest of the british army as it is the only regiment that recruits its soldier strictly from nepal ; a relationship that has its roots in the times of british raj . the kukri is the staple weapon of all gurkha military regiments and units throughout the world , so much so that some english-speakers refer to the weapon as a '' gurkha blade '' or '' gurkha knife '' . the kukri often appears in nepalis and indian gorkha heraldry and is used in many traditional , hindu-centric rites such as wedding ceremonies . there have been , and still are many myths surrounding the kukri since its earliest recorded use in the 7th century—most notably that a traditional custom revolves around the blade in which it must draw blood , owing to its sole purpose as a fighting weapon , before being sheathed . however , they are frequently used as regular utility tools . extraordinary stories of their use in combat by gurkhas may contribute to this misconception . the kukri , khukri , and kukkri spellings are of indian english origin , with the original nepalese english spelling being khukuri .
