ståhlberg was an important figure in the years of the finland 's independence and constitution , driving his republican program through adversity . as a jurist , he anchored the state in liberal democracy , guarded the fragile germ of the rule of law , and embarked on internal reforms . in implementing the form of government of 1919 , ståhlberg piloted an independent finland towards acting in world politics ; in presidential-led foreign and security policy , he relied on international law and diplomacy . it was only after the opening of private archives of president j . k . paasikivi that it was realized that ståhlberg had a very significant political role as a “ éminence grise ” until his death . he was asked for advice and opinions , which were also followed . paasikivi highly valued ståhlberg , and even described his predecessor in exaggerated words : “ ståhlberg was a man who never made mistakes ” . george maude : aspects of the governing of the finns ( studies in modern european history ) . peter lang inc . , international academic publishers , 2010 .
