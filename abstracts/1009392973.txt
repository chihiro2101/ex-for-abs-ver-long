scattering is a term used in physics to describe a wide range of physical processes where moving particles or radiation of some form , such as light or sound , is forced to deviate from a straight trajectory by localized non-uniformities ( including particles and radiation ) in the medium through which they pass . in conventional use , this also includes deviation of reflected radiation from the angle predicted by the law of reflection . reflections of radiation that undergo scattering are often called diffuse reflections and unscattered reflections are called specular ( mirror-like ) reflections . originally , the term was confined to light scattering ( going back at least as far as isaac newton in the 17th century ) . as more '' ray '' -like phenomena were discovered , the idea of scattering was extended to them , so that william herschel could refer to the scattering of '' heat rays '' ( not then recognized as electromagnetic in nature ) in 1800 . john tyndall , a pioneer in light scattering research , noted the connection between light scattering and acoustic scattering in the 1870s . near the end of the 19th century , the scattering of cathode rays ( electron beams ) and x-rays was observed and discussed . with the discovery of subatomic particles ( e.g . ernest rutherford in 1911 ) and the development of quantum theory in the 20th century , the sense of the term became broader as it was recognized that the same mathematical frameworks used in light scattering could be applied to many other phenomena . scattering thus refers to particle collision between molecules , atoms , electrons , photons and other particles . examples include : cosmic ray scattering in the earth 's upper atmosphere ; particle collisions inside particle accelerators ; electron scattering by gas atoms in fluorescent lamps ; and neutron scattering inside nuclear reactors . seinfeld , john h . ; pandis , spyros n .
