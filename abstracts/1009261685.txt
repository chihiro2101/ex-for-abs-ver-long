a convertible , cabriolet or spyder/spider is a car that can be driven with or without a roof in place . the methods of retracting and storing the roof vary between models . a convertible allows an open-air driving experience , with the ability to provide a roof when required . potential drawbacks of convertibles are reduced torsion ( mechanics ) ( requiring significant engineering and modification to counteract the effects of removing a car 's roof ) to neutralize the loss of torsional rigidity inherent in any convertible , vw engineers took the basket-handle roll bar of the vw cabrio , inverted it and placed it under the rear seat pedestal . a beefed-up windshield frame of hot-stamped ultra-high-strength steel is connected directly to the floorpan â€™ s reinforced frame rails . steel tubing provides more stiffness behind the doors for an extra layer of safety . partly as a consequence , rear seat passengers have about 10 inches less shoulder room than in the smaller rabbit . and cargo space . the majority of convertible roofs are a folding construction made from cloth . other types of convertible roofs include retractable hardtops ( often constructed from metal or plastic ) and detachable hardtops ( where a metal or plastic roof is manually removed and often stored in the trunk ) .
