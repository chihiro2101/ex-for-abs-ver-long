in theatre , a lighting designer ( or ld ) works with the director , choreographer , set designer , costume designer , and sound designer to create the lighting , atmosphere , and time of day for the production in response to the text , while keeping in mind issues of visibility , safety , and cost . the ld also works closely with the stage manager or show control programming , if show control systems are used in that production . outside stage lighting , the job of a lighting designer can be much more diverse and they can be found working on rock and pop tours , corporate launches , art installations , or lighting effects at sporting events .
