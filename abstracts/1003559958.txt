in computational intelligence ( ci ) , an evolutionary algorithm ( ea ) is a subset of evolutionary computation , a generic population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm . an ea uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution , such as reproduction , mutation , recombination , and selection . candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population , and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions ( see also loss function ) . evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators . evolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying fitness landscape . techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of microevolution and planning models based upon cellular processes . in most real applications of eas , computational complexity is a prohibiting factor . in fact , this computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation . fitness approximation is one of the solutions to overcome this difficulty . however , seemingly simple ea can solve often complex problems ; therefore , there may be no direct link between algorithm complexity and problem complexity .
