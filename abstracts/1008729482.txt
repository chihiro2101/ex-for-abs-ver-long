wolfe 's plan of attack depended on secrecy and surprise . his plan required that a small party of men should land by night on the north shore , climb the promontory of quebec , seize a small road , and overpower the garrison that protected it , allowing the bulk of his army ( 5,000 men ) to ascend the cliff by the small road and then deploy for battle on the plateau . even if the first landing party succeeded in their mission and the army was able to follow , such a deployment would still leave his forces inside the french line of defense with no immediate retreat but the river . it is possible that wolfe 's decision to change the landing site was owing less to a desire for secrecy and more to his general disdain for his brigadiers ( a feeling that was reciprocated ) ; it is also possible that he was still suffering the effects of his illness and the opiates he used as painkillers . . historians believe wolfe ordered the attack believing the advanced guard would be repulsed , and anticipated dying gallantly with his men rather than returning home in disgrace . . .
