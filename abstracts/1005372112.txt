a fireteam or fire team is a small military quaternion sub-subunit of infantry designed to optimise '' bounding overwatch '' and '' fire and movement '' military doctrine in combat . depending on mission requirements , a typical fireteam consists of four or fewer members : an automatic rifleman , a grenadier , a rifleman , and a designated team leader . the role of each fireteam leader is to ensure that the fireteam operates as a cohesive unit . two or three fireteams are organised into a section or squad in co-ordinated operations , which is led by a squad leader . historically , nations with effective fireteam organisation have had a significantly better performance from their infantry units in combat than those limited to operations by traditionally larger units . fireteams are the smallest military organization that use them ; the only military units smaller than a fireteam are soldier support teams or specialist teams ( such as anti-tank teams , hmg teams , mortar teams , sniper teams , eod teams , and dogs in warfare ) that are designed to operate independently . fireteams are the primary unit upon which modern infantry organisation is based in the british army , royal air force regiment , royal marines , united states army , united states marine corps , air force security forces , canadian forces , and australian army .
