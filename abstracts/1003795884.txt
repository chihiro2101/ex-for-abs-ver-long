cantharidin is an odorless , colorless fatty substance of the terpenoid class , which is secreted by many species of blister beetles . including broadly in genus epicauta , genus berberomeloe , and in species lytta vesicatoria . oedemeridae , pyrochroidae , and soldier beetles also produce cantharidin . it is a burn agent or a poison in large doses , but preparations containing it were historically used as aphrodisiacs ( spanish fly ) . in its natural form , cantharidin is secreted by the male blister beetle and given to the female as a copulatory gift during mating . afterwards , the female beetle covers her eggs with it as a defense against predators . poisoning from cantharidin is a significant veterinary concern , especially in horses , but it can also be poisonous to humans if taken internally ( where the source is usually experimental self-exposure ) . externally , cantharidin is a potent vesicant ( blistering agent ) , exposure to which can cause severe chemical burns . properly dosed and applied , the same properties have also been used therapeutically , for instance for treatment of skin conditions such as molluscum contagiosum infection of the skin . cantharidin is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the united states and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities that produce , store , or use it in significant quantities . as defined in section 302 of the u.s . emergency planning and community right-to-know act ( 42 u.s.c . 11002 ) . see '' 40 c.f.r . : appendix a to part 355â€”the list of extremely hazardous substances and their threshold planning quantities '' ( pdf ) ( july 1 , 2008 ed . ) . u.s . government printing office . retrieved october 29 , 2011 .
