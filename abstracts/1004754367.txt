members of parliament ( mps ) sitting in the house of commons in the united kingdom are not permitted to resign their seats . to circumvent this prohibition , mps who wish to step down are instead appointed to an '' office of profit under the crown , '' which disqualifies them from sitting in parliament . for this purpose , a legal fiction is maintained where two unpaid offices are considered to be offices of profit : steward and bailiff of the chiltern hundreds , and steward and bailiff of the manor of northstead . although the house of commons disqualification act 1975 lists hundreds of offices that are disqualifying , no mp has lost their seat by being appointed to an actual office since 1981 , when thomas williams became a judge .
