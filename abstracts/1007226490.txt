in biology , quorum sensing ( or quorum signalling ) is the ability to detect and respond to cell population density by gene regulation . as one example , quorum sensing ( qs ) enables bacteria to restrict the expression of specific genes to the high cell densities at which the resulting phenotypes will be most beneficial . many species of bacteria use quorum sensing to coordinate gene expression according to the density of their local population . in a similar fashion , some social insects use quorum sensing to determine where to nest . quorum sensing may also be useful for cancer cell communications . in addition to its function in biological systems , quorum sensing has several useful applications for computing and robotics . in general , quorum sensing can function as a decision-making process in any decentralized system in which the components have : ( a ) a means of assessing the number of other components they interact with and ( b ) a standard response once a threshold number of components is detected .
