hari seldon is a fictional character in isaac asimov 's foundation series . in his capacity as mathematics professor at streeling university on the planet trantor , seldon develops psychohistory , an algorithmic science that allows him to predict the future in probabilistic terms . on the basis of his psychohistory he is able to predict the eventual fall of the galactic empire and to develop a means to shorten the millennia of chaos to follow . the significance of his discoveries lies behind his nickname '' raven '' seldon . in the first five books of the foundation series , hari seldon made only one in-the-flesh appearance , in the first part of the first book ( foundation ) , although he did appear at other times in pre-recorded messages to reveal a '' seldon crisis '' . after writing five books in chronological order , asimov retroactively added two books to expand on the genesis of psychohistory . the two prequels—prelude to foundation and forward the foundation—describe seldon 's life in considerable detail . he is also the central character of the second foundation trilogy written after asimov 's death ( foundation 's fear by gregory benford , foundation and chaos by greg bear , and foundation 's triumph by david brin ) , which are set after asimov 's two prequels .
