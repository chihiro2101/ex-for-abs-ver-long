very low frequency or vlf is the itu designation for radio frequency ( rf ) in the range of 3â€“30 & nbsp ; khz , corresponding to wavelengths from 100 to 10 & nbsp ; km , respectively . the band is also known as the myriameter band or myriameter wave as the wavelengths range from one to ten myriameters ( an obsolete metric unit equal to 10 & nbsp ; kilometers ) . due to its limited bandwidth , audio ( voice ) transmission is highly impractical in this band , and therefore only low data rate coded signals are used . the vlf band is used for a few radio navigation services , government time signal ( broadcasting time signals to set radio clocks ) and for secure military communication . since vlf waves can penetrate at least 40 & nbsp ; meters ( 131 & nbsp ; ft ) into saltwater , they are used for military communication with submarines .
