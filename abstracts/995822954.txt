the kerrison predictor was one of the first fully automated anti-aircraft fire-control systems . the predictor could aim a gun at an aircraft based on simple inputs like the observed speed and the angle to the target . such devices had been used on ships for gunnery control for some time , and versions such as the vickers predictor were available for larger anti-aircraft guns intended to be used against high-altitude bombers , but the kerrison 's electromechanical analog computer was the first to be fast enough to be used in the demanding high-speed low-altitude role , which involved very short engagement times and high angular rates . the design was also adopted for use in the united states , where it was produced by singer corporation as the m5 antiaircraft director .
