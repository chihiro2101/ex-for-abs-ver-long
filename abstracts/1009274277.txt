animal welfare is the well-being of non-human animals . formal standards of animal welfare vary between contexts , but are debated mostly by animal welfare groups , legislators , and academics . animal welfare science uses measures such as longevity , disease , immunosuppression , ethology , physiology , and reproduction , although there is debate about which of these best indicate animal welfare . respect for animal welfare is often based on the belief that nonhuman animals are sentient and that consideration should be given to their well-being or suffering , especially when they are under the care of humans . these concerns can include how animals are slaughtered for food , how they are used in animal testing , how they are kept ( as pets , in zoos , farms , circuses , etc . ) , and how human activities affect the welfare and survival of wild species . there are two forms of criticism of the concept of animal welfare , coming from diametrically opposite positions . one view , held by some thinkers in history , holds that humans have no duties of any kind to animals . the other view is based on the animal rights position that animals should not be regarded as property and any use of animals by humans is unacceptable . accordingly , some animal rights proponents argue that the perception of better animal welfare facilitates continued and increased exploitation of animals . some authorities therefore treat animal welfare and animal rights as two opposing positions . others see animal welfare gains as incremental steps towards animal rights . the predominant view of modern neuroscientists , notwithstanding philosophical problems with the definition of consciousness even in humans , is that animal consciousness in nonhuman animals . however , some still maintain that consciousness is a philosophical question that may never be scientifically resolved .
