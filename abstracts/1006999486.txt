the shirelles were an american girl group notable for their rhythm and blues , doo-wop and soul music who gained popularity in the early 1960s . they consisted of schoolmates shirley owens ( later shirley alston reeves ) , doris coley ( later doris kenner-jackson ) , addie '' micki '' harris ( later addie harris mcfadden ) , and beverly lee . founded in 1957 for a talent show at their high school , they were signed by florence greenberg of tiara records . their first single , '' i met him on a sunday '' , was released by tiara and licensed by decca records in 1958 . after a brief and unsuccessful period with decca , they went with greenberg to her newly formed company , scepter records . working with luther dixon , the group rose to fame with '' tonight 's the night '' . after a successful period of collaboration with dixon and promotion by scepter , with seven top 20 hits , the shirelles left scepter in 1966 . afterwards , they were unable to maintain their previous popularity . the shirelles have been described as having a '' naive schoolgirl sound '' that contrasted with the sexual themes of many of their songs . several of their hits used strings and bai√£o-style music . they have been credited with launching the girl group genre , with much of their music reflecting the genre 's essence . their acceptance by both white and black audiences , predating that of the motown acts , has been noted as reflecting the early success of the civil rights movement . they have received numerous honors , including the pioneer award from the rhythm and blues foundation , as well as being inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 1996 , and named one of the 100 greatest artists of all time by rolling stone in 2004 . two of their songs , '' will you love me tomorrow '' and '' tonight 's the night '' , were selected by rolling stone on the 500 greatest songs of all time .
