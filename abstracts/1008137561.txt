a tattoo machine is a hand-held device generally used to create a tattoo , a permanent marking of the skin with indelible ink . modern tattoo machines use electromagnetic coils to move an armature bar up and down . connected to the armature bar is a barred needle grouping that pushes ink into the skin . tattoo artists generally use the term '' machine '' , pen , or even '' iron '' , to refer to their equipment . the word '' gun '' is occasionally used but is widely considered derogatory or even offensive by some professional artists . in addition to '' coiled '' tattoo machines , there are also rotary tattoo machines , which are powered by regulated motors rather than electromagnetic coils . '' the basic machine is pretty much unchanged today , in recent years variations of the theme have crept into the market , namely manfred kohrs rotary machine of 1976 or carson hill â€™ s pneumatic machine that uses compressed air rather than electricity , but the principle is essentially the same .
