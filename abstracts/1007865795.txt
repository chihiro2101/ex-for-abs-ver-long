animal sacrifice is the ritual killing and offering of an animal , usually as part of a religious ritual or to appease or maintain favour with a deity . animal sacrifices were common throughout europe and the ancient near east until the spread of christianity in late antiquity , and continue in some cultures or religions today . human sacrifice , where it existed , was always much more rare . all or only part of a sacrificial animal may be offered ; some cultures , like the ancient and modern greeks , eat most of the edible parts of the sacrifice in a feast , and burnt the rest as an offering . others burnt the whole animal offering , called a holocaust . usually the best animal or best share of the animal is the one presented for offering . animal sacrifice should generally be distinguished from the religiously-prescribed methods of ritual slaughter of animals for normal consumption as food . during the neolithic revolution , early humans began to move from hunter-gatherer cultures toward agriculture , leading to the spread of animal domestication . in a theory presented in homo necans , mythologist walter burkert suggests that the ritual sacrifice of livestock may have developed as a continuation of ancient hunting history , as livestock replaced wild game in the food supply .
