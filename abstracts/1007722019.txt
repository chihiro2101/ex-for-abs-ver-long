john evelyn ( 31 october 162027 february 1706 ) was an english writer , gardener and diary . john evelyn 's diary , or memoir , spanned the period of his adult life from 1640 , when he was a student , to 1706 , the year he died . he did not write daily at all times . the many volumes provide insight into life and events at a time before regular magazines or newspapers were published , making diaries of greater interest to modern historians than such works might have been at later periods . evelyn 's work covers art , culture and politics , including the execution of charles i , oliver cromwell 's rise and eventual natural death , the last great plague of london , and the great fire of london in 1666 . evelyn 's posthumously '' rival '' diarist , samuel pepys , wrote a different kind of diary , covering a much shorter period , 1660â€“1669 , but in much greater depth , within the same era . over the years , evelyn 's diary has been overshadowed by pepys 's chronicles of 17th-century life . chris roberts , heavy words lightly thrown : the reason behind rhyme , thorndike press , 2006
