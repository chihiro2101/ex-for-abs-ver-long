unschooling is an informal learning that advocates learner-chosen activities as a primary means for learning . unschoolers learn through their natural life experiences including play , household responsibilities , personal interests and curiosity , internships and work experience , travel , books , elective classes , family , mentors , and social interaction . often considered a lesson- and curriculum-free implementation of homeschooling , unschooling encourages exploration of activities initiated by the children themselves , believing that the more personal learning is , the more meaningful , well-understood and therefore useful it is to the child . while courses may occasionally be taken , unschooling questions the usefulness of standard curricula , fixed times at which learning should take place , conventional grading methods in standardized tests , forced contact with children in their own age group , the compulsion to do homework , regardless of whether it helps you in your individual situation , the effectiveness of listening to and obeying the orders of one authority figure for several hours each day , and other features of traditional schooling in the education of each unique child . the term '' unschooling '' was coined in the 1970s and used by educator john holt , widely regarded as the father of unschooling . even though unschooling is often seen as a subset of homeschooling and homeschooling has been the subject of broad public debate , unschooling in particular has received relatively little media attention and has only become increasingly popular in recent years . critics of unschooling see it as an extreme educational philosophy , with concerns that unschooled children will be neglected , miss many things that are important for their future life , will not experience how it is like to have to do something you do not want to do , and lack the social skills , structure , discipline , and motivation of their schooled peers , while proponents of unschooling say exactly the opposite is true : that self-directed education in a non-academic , often natural and diversified environment is a far more efficient , sustainable and child-friendly form of education than schooling , which preserves the innate curiosity , pleasure and willingness in discovering and learning new things , invites children to be part of society , shows children how to deal with their surroundings and own existence in a self-determined and yet responsible manner , makes children understand why certain properties , skills , abilities , values and norms are important rather than just telling them to obtain and adhere to them , rewards and supports creativity , individuality and innovation , teaches how to acquire new things and find your way in unfamiliar situations quickly , and better equips a child to handle the '' real world '' outside of school .
