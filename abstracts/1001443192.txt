european rabbits ( oryctolagus cuniculus ) were introduced to australia in the 18th century with the first fleet and eventually became widespread . such wild rabbit populations are a serious mammalian pest and invasive species in australia causing millions of dollars â€™ worth of damage to crops . their spread may have been enhanced through the emergence of strong crossbreeds . various methods in the 20th century have been attempted to control the australian rabbit population . conventional methods include shooting rabbits and destroying their warrens , but these had only limited success . in 1907 , a rabbit-proof fence was built in western australia in an unsuccessful attempt to contain the rabbits . the myxoma virus , which causes myxomatosis , was introduced into the rabbit population in the 1950s and had the effect of severely reducing the rabbit population . however , the survivors have since adapted and partially recovered their previous numbers .
