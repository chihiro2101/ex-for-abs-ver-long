trinitron is sony 's brand name for its line of aperture grille-based crts used in television sets and computer monitors . one of the first truly innovative television systems to enter the market since the 1950s , the trinitron was announced in 1968 to wide acclaim for its bright images , about 25 % brighter than common shadow mask televisions of the same era . constant improvement in the basic technology and attention to overall quality allowed sony to charge a premium for trinitron devices into the 1990s . patent protection on the basic trinitron design ran out in 1996 , and it quickly faced a number of competitors at much lower prices . sony responded by introducing their flat-screen fd trinitron designs ( wega ) , which maintained their premier position in the market into the early 2000s . however , these designs were surpassed relatively quickly by plasma and lcd designs . sony removed the last trinitron televisions from their product catalogs in 2006 , and ceased production in early 2008 . video monitors are the only remaining trinitron products being produced by sony , at a low production rate , although the basic technology can still be found in downmarket televisions from third parties . the name trinitron was derived from trinity , meaning the union of three , and tron from electron tube , after the way that the trinitron combined the three separate electron guns of other crt designs into one . right
