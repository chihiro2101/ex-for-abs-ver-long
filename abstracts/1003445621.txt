orbital mechanics or astrodynamics is the application of ballistics and celestial mechanics to the practical problems concerning the motion of rockets and other spacecraft . the motion of these objects is usually calculated from newton 's laws of motion and law of universal gravitation . orbital mechanics is a core discipline within space-mission design and control . celestial mechanics treats more broadly the orbital dynamics of systems under the influence of gravity , including both spacecraft and natural astronomical object such as star systems , planets , moons , and comets . orbital mechanics focuses on spacecraft trajectory , including orbital maneuvers , orbital plane changes , and interplanetary transfers , and is used by mission planners to predict the results of propulsive maneuvers . general relativity is a more exact theory than newton 's laws for calculating orbits , and is sometimes necessary for greater accuracy or in high-gravity situations ( e.g . orbits near the sun ) .
