the pennsylvania dutch ( pennsilfaanisch-deitsch ) , also referred to as the pennsylvania germans , are a cultural group formed through those who emigrated primarily from the territory in europe now partly within modern-day germany ( mainly from palatinate , baden-w√ºrttemberg and rhineland ) , but also from the netherlands , switzerland and today france ( alsace-lorraine ) travelling down the river rhine to the sea ports . the word deitsch corresponds with the high german word deutsch ( in standard german ) , meaning '' german '' , and is how the first settlers would have described themselves in the principal southern german dialect spoken : palatine german . most of these settlers emigrated in the 17th and 18th centuries to america and spoke unique dialects within the german language family , but it is through their cross-dialogue interaction and what was retained by subsequent generations that a hybrid dialect emerged , known as pennsylvania german or pennsylvania dutch , which has resonance to this day . the pennsylvania dutch maintained numerous religion , with the greatest number being lutheran or german reformed , but also with many anabaptists , including mennonites , amish , and brethren . the anabaptist religions promoted a simple life-style , and their adherents were known as plain people or plain dutch . this was in contrast to the fancy dutch , who tended to assimilate more easily into the american mainstream . other religions were also represented by the late 1700s , in smaller numbers .
