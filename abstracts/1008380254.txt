in the mathematics field of dynamical systems , an attractor is a set of numerical values toward which a system tends to evolve , for a wide variety of starting conditions of the system . system values that get close enough to the attractor values remain close even if slightly disturbed . in finite-dimensional systems , the evolving variable may be represented algebraically as an n-dimensional vector . the attractor is a region in space ( mathematics ) . in physics , the n dimensions may be , for example , two or three positional coordinates for each of one or more physical entities ; in economics , they may be separate variables such as the inflation rate and the unemployment rate . if the evolving variable is two- or three-dimensional , the attractor of the dynamic process can be represented geometry in two or three dimensions , ( as for example in the three-dimensional case depicted to the right ) . an attractor can be a point , a finite set of points , a curve , a manifold , or even a complicated set with a fractal structure known as a strange attractor ( see strange attractor below ) . if the variable is a scalar , the attractor is a subset of the real number line . describing the attractors of chaotic dynamical systems has been one of the achievements of chaos theory . a trajectory of the dynamical system in the attractor does not have to satisfy any special constraints except for remaining on the attractor , forward in time . the trajectory may be periodic or chaotic . if a set of points is periodic or chaotic , but the flow in the neighborhood is away from the set , the set is not an attractor , but instead is called a repeller ( or repellor ) .
