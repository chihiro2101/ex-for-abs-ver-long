this page is intended for collecting quotations about wikipedia . such quotations can be useful for press releases , discussions etc . like any good marketing page , it should primarily list positive opinions , although criticism can of course be part of such opinions . please do not add '' made up '' testimonials to this page ; instead , only add testimonials from other pages , comments , articles and so on , and always provide the source with the quote . awards should be collected in the trophy box on meta . for the opposite viewpoint , see the criticisms page , quoting critics who will ( hopefully ) be proven wrong .
