in computing , a windowing system ( or window system ) is software that manages separately different parts of display screens . it is a type of graphical user interface ( gui ) which implements the wimp ( windows , icons , menus , pointer ) paradigm for a user interface . each currently running application is assigned a usually resizable and usually rectangular surface of the display to present its gui to the user ; these windows may overlap each other , as opposed to a tiling interface where they are not allowed to overlap . usually a window decoration is drawn around each window . the programming of both the window decoration and of available widgets inside of the window , which are computer graphicss for direct user interaction , such as sliders , buttons , etc . , is eased and simplified through the use of widget toolkits .
