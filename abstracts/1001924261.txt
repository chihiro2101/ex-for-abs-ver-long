the electric prunes are an american psychedelic rock band , formed in los angeles , california , in 1965 . much of the band 's music was , as music historian richie unterberger described it , possessed of '' an eerie and sometimes anguished ambiance '' , and , early on , mainly consisted of material by songwriters annette tucker and nancie mantz , though the group also penned their own songs . incorporating psychedelia and elements of embryonic electronic rock , the band 's sound was marked by innovative recording techniques with fuzzbox guitars and oscillating sound effects . in addition , guitarist ken williams ' and singer james lowe 's concept of '' free-form garage music '' provided the band with a richer sonic palette and exploratory lyrical structure than many of their contemporaries . the band was signed to reprise records in 1966 and released their first single , '' ai n't it hard '' , in the latter part of the year . their first album , the electric prunes , included the band 's two nationally charting songs , '' i had too much to dream ( last night ) '' and '' get me to the world on time '' . with the appearance of their second album , underground , the band was more free to create their own material . however , the original group disbanded by 1968 when they proved unable to record the innovative and complex arrangements by david axelrod on the albums mass in f minor and release of an oath . both albums were released under the band 's name , the rights to which were owned by their record producer david hassinger , but were largely performed by other musicians . several of the original band members reconvened in 1999 and began recording again . the band still performs occasionally , although the only remaining original member is lead singer james lowe .
