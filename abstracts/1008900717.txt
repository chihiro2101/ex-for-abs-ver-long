an oil lamp is an object used to produce light continuously for a period of time using an oil-based fuel source . the use of oil lamps began thousands of years ago and continues to this day , although their use is less common in modern times . oil lamps are a form of lighting , and were used as an alternative to candles before the use of electric lights . starting in 1780 , the argand lamp quickly replaced other oil lamps still in their basic ancient form . these in turn were replaced by the kerosene lamp in about 1850 . in small towns and rural areas the latter continued in use well into the 20th century , until such areas were finally electrified and light bulbs could be used . sources of fuel for oil lamps include a wide variety of plants such as nuts ( walnuts , almonds , and kukui ) and seeds ( sesame , olive , castor , or flax ) . also widely used were animal fats ( butter , ghee , fish oil , shark liver , whale blubber , or seal ) . camphine , a blend of turpentine and ethanol , was the first '' burning fluid '' fuel for lamps after whale oil supplies were depleted . it was replaced by kerosene after the us congress enacted excise taxes on alcohol to pay for the civil war . most modern lamps ( such as fueled lanterns ) have been replaced by propane or petroleum-based fuels to operate when emergency non-electric light is required . therefore , oil lamps of today are primarily used for the particular ambience they produce .
