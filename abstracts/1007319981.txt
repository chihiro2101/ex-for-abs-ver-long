thumb bonampak ( known anciently as ak ' e or , in its immediate area as usiij witz , 'vulture hill ' ) is an ancient maya archaeological site in the mexico state of chiapas . the site is approximately south of the larger site of yaxchilan , under which bonampak was a dependency , and the border with guatemala . while the site is not overly impressive in terms of spatial or architectural size ( american archaeologist , epigrapher , and mayanist scholar sylvanus morley once stated that bonampak was fourth-rate in terms of size and political importance ) , it is well known for the murals located within the three roomed structure 1 ( the temple of the murals ) . the construction of the site 's structures dates to the late classic period ( c . ad 580 to 800 ) . in addition to being among the best-preserved maya murals , the bonampak murals are noteworthy for debunking early assumptions that the maya were a peaceful culture of mystics ( a position long-held and argued for by the well-known early mesoamerican archaeologist , ethnohistorian and epigrapher from the carnegie institute of washington , sir john eric sidney thompson ) , as the murals clearly depict war and human sacrifice . the site , lying close to a tributary of the usumacinta river , was first seen by non-mayans in 1946 . precisely who was first is a matter of speculation , but it was either two american travelers , herman charles ( carlos ) frey and john bourne , or photographer/explorer giles healey . the americans were led to the ruins by the local lacandon maya who still visited the site to pray in the ancient temples . giles healey was the first to be shown the huge paintings covering the walls of one of the structure 's three rooms . the paintings show the story of a single battle and its victorious outcome .
