thumb invisibility is the state of an object that can not be seen . an object in this state is said to be invisible ( literally , '' not visible '' ) . the term is often used in fantasy/science fiction , where objects can not be seen by magical or technology means ; however , its effects can also be demonstrated in the real world , particularly in physics and perceptual psychology classes . since objects can be seen by light in the visible spectrum from a source reflecting off their surfaces and hitting the viewer 's eye , the most natural form of invisibility ( whether real or fictional ) is an object that neither reflects nor absorbs light ( that is , it allows light to pass through it ) . this is known as transparency , and is seen in many naturally occurring materials ( although no naturally occurring material is 100 % transparent ) . invisibility perception depends on several optical and visual factors . for example , invisibility depends on the eyes of the observer and/or the instruments used . thus an object can be classified as '' invisible to '' a person , animal , instrument , etc . in research on sensorial perception it has been shown that invisibility is perceived in cycles . invisibility is often considered to be the supreme form of camouflage , as it does not reveal to the viewer any kind of vital signs , visual effects , or any frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum detectable to the human eye , instead making use of radio , infrared or ultraviolet wavelengths . in illusion optics , invisibility is a special case of illusion effects : the illusion of free space .
