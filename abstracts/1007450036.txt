dutch elm disease ( ded ) is caused by a member of the sac fungi ( ascomycota ) affecting elm trees , and is spread by elm bark beetles . although believed to be originally native to asia , the disease was accidentally introduced into america and europe , where it has devastated native populations of elms that did not have resistance to the disease . it has also reached new zealand . the name '' dutch elm disease '' refers to its identification in 1921 and later in the netherlands by dutch phytopathologists bea schwarz and christine buisman , who both worked with professor johanna westerdijk . the disease affects species in the genera ulmus and zelkova ; therefore it is not specific to the dutch elm hybrid .
