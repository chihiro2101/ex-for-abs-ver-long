human intelligence is the intellectual capability of humans , which is marked by complex cognition feats and high levels of motivation and self-awareness . through intelligence , humans possess the cognition abilities to learn , form concepts , understand , apply logic , and reason , including the capacities to recognize patterns , plan , innovate , solve problems , make decisions , memory , and use language to communicate . there are conflicting ideas about how intelligence is measured , ranging from the idea that intelligence is fixed upon birth , or that it is malleable and can change depending on an individual â€™ s mindset and efforts . several subcategories of intelligence , such as emotional intelligence or social intelligence , are heavily debated as to whether they are traditional forms of intelligence . they are generally thought to be distinct processes that occur , though there is speculation that they tie into traditional intelligence more than previously suspected .
