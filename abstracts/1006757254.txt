the massacre of glencoe took place in glen coe in the highlands of scotland on 13 february 1692 . an estimated 30 members and associates of clan macdonald of glencoe were killed by government forces , allegedly for failing to pledge allegiance to the new monarchs , william ii and iii and mary ii . by may 1690 , the jacobite rising of 1689 was no longer a serious military threat but unrest continued in the remote highlands ; with william also engaged in the nine years war , the scottish government was under pressure to end it . in march 1690 , the jacobite chiefs agreed to swear allegiance in return for cash payments , but continually delayed ; despite finally committing themselves under the june 1691 declaration of achallader , they still had not done so by december . the secretary of state for scotland , lord stair , decided to make an example to provide a warning of the consequences for further delay . contrary to popular myth , the glencoe macdonalds were not the only ones who failed to meet the deadline , while the keppoch macdonalds did not swear until early february . the reason for their selection is still debated but appears to have been a combination of internal clan politics , and a reputation for lawlessness that made them an easy target . while the massacre was not unique in scottish history and many of those who opposed it had little sympathy for the victims , its brutality shocked contemporaries even by the standards of the late 17th century . the event became a significant element in the persistence of jacobitism in the highlands during the first half of the 18th century , and remains a powerful symbol for a variety of reasons .
