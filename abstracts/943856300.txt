in geometry , an orthocentric system is a set of four points on a plane , one of which is the orthocenter of the triangle formed by the other three . if four points form an orthocentric system , then each of the four points is the orthocenter of the other three . these four possible triangles will all have the same nine-point circle . consequently these four possible triangles must all have circumcircles with the same circumradius .
