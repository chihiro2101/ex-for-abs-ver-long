swann v . charlotte-mecklenburg board of education , 402 u.s . 1 ( 1971 ) , was a landmark united states supreme court case dealing with the busing of students to promote integration in public schools . . the court held that busing was an appropriate remedy for the problem of racial imbalance in schools , even when the imbalance resulted from the selection of students based on geographic proximity to the school rather than from deliberate assignment based on race . this was done to ensure the schools would be '' properly '' integrated and that all students would receive equal educational opportunities regardless of their race . judge john j . parker of the u.s . court of appeals for the fourth circuit interpreted the brown v . board of education case as a charge not to segregate rather than an order to integrate . in 1963 , the court ruled in mcneese v . board of education and goss v . board of education in favor of integration , and showed impatience with efforts to end segregation . in 1968 the warren court ruled in green v . county school board that freedom of choice plans were insufficient to eliminate segregation ; thus , it was necessary to take proactive steps to integrate schools . in united states v . montgomery county board of education ( 1969 ) , judge frank johnson 's desegregation order for teachers was upheld , allowing an approximate ratio of the races to be established by a district judge .
