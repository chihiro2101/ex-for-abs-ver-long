in organizational behavior and industrial and organizational psychology , organizational commitment is an individual 's psychology attachment to the organization . organizational scientists have also developed many nuanced definitions of organizational commitment , and numerous scales to measure them . exemplary of this work is meyer and allen 's model of commitment , which was developed to integrate numerous definitions of commitment that had been proliferated in the literature . meyer and allen 's model has also been critiqued because the model is not consistent with empirical findings . it may also not be fully applicable in domains such as customer behavior . there has also been debate surrounding what meyers and allen 's model was trying to achieve . the basis behind many of these studies was to find ways to improve how workers feel about their jobs so that these workers would become more committed to their organizations . organizational commitment predicts work variables such as turnover , organizational citizenship behavior , and job performance . some of the factors such as role stress , empowerment , job insecurity and employability , and distribution of leadership have been shown to be connected to a worker 's sense of organizational commitment .
