the ibm series/1 is a 16-bit minicomputer , introduced in 1976 , that in many respects competed with other minicomputers of the time , such as the pdp-11 from digital equipment corporation and similar offerings from data general and hp . the series/1 was typically used to control and operate external electro-mechanical components while also allowing for primitive data storage and handling . although the series/1 uses ebcdic character encoding internally and locally attached ebcdic terminals , ascii-based remote terminals and devices could be attached via an i/o card with a rs-232 interface to be more compatible with competing minicomputers . ibm 's own 3101 and 3151 ascii display terminals are examples of this . this was a departure from ibm mainframes that used 3270 terminals and coaxial attachment . series/1 computers were withdrawn from marketing in 1988 at or near the introduction of the as/400 line . a us government asset report dated may 2016 revealed that an ibm series/1 was still being used as part of the country 's nuclear command and control systems .
