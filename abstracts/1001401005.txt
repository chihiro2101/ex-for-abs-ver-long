the napier sabre was a british h engine , coolant , sleeve valve , piston aero engine , designed by frank halford and built by d . napier & son during world war ii . the engine evolved to become one of the most powerful inline piston aircraft engines in the world , developing from in its earlier versions to in late-model prototypes . the first operational aircraft to be powered by the sabre were the hawker typhoon and hawker tempest ; the first aircraft powered by the sabre was the napier-heston racer , which was designed to capture the world speed record . other aircraft using the sabre were early prototype and production variants of the blackburn firebrand , the martin-baker mb 3 prototype and a hawker fury prototype . the rapid introduction of jet engines after the war led to the quick demise of the sabre , as there was less need for high power military piston aero engines and because napier turned its attention to developing turboprop engines such as the naiad and eland .
