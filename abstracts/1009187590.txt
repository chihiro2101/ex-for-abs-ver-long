jade is an ornamental mineral , mostly known for its green varieties , though it appears naturally in other colors as well , notably yellow and white . jade can refer to either of two different silicate minerals : nephrite ( a silicate of calcium and magnesium in the amphibole group of minerals ) , or jadeite ( a silicate of sodium and aluminium in the pyroxene group of minerals ) . jade is found in east asian , south asian and southeast asian art , but also has an important place in mexico and guatemala.the use of jade in mesoamerica for symbolic and ideological ritual was highly influenced by its rarity and value among pre-columbian mesoamerican cultures , such as the olmec , the maya , and the various groups in the valley of mexico . although jade artifacts have been created and prized by many mesoamerican peoples , the motagua river valley in guatemala was previously thought to be the sole source of jadeite in the region .
