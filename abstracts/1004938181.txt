mohair ( pronounced is a fabric or yarn made from the hair of the angora goat ( not to be confused with the angora rabbit , which produces angora wool ) . both durable and resilient , mohair is notable for its high luster and sheen , and is often used in fiber blends to add these qualities to a textile . mohair takes dye exceptionally well . it feels warm in winter as it has excellent insulating properties , while its moisture-wicking properties allow it to remain cool in summer . it is durable , naturally elastic , flame-resistant and crease-resistant . it is considered a luxury fiber , like cashmere , angora , and silk , and can be more expensive than most sheep 's wool . mohair is composed mostly of keratin , a protein found in the hair , wool , horns and skin of all mammals , but mohair 's special properties are unique to the angora goat . while it has scales like wool , the scales are not fully developed , merely indicated . thus , mohair does not feel the same way common or standard wool does . mohair fiber is approximately 25â€“45 microns in diameter . it increases in diameter with the age of the goat , growing along with the animal . finer , softer hair from younger animals is used ( for example ) in scarves and shawls ; the thicker , coarser hair from older animals is more often used for carpets and in heavy fabrics intended for outerwear . the term mohair is sometimes used to describe a type of material used for the folding roof on convertible cars . in this instance , mohair refers to a form of denim-like canvas .
