a zebra crossing is a type of pedestrian crossing used in many places around the world . its distinguishing feature is that it gives priority to pedestrians ; once someone has indicated their intent to cross by waiting by the crossing , motorists are obliged to stop . these were introduced to the uk in the 1930s as a road safety measure and were marked by a pair of striped poles , each supporting a flashing orange light , known as belisha beacons . in the 1940s road markings were added to the crossing design : these were alternating dark and light stripes on the road surface . these stripes , resembling the coat of a zebra , give rise to the common name . the striped road marking has been adopted in many countries for their crossings for this purpose ; however not all have the pedestrian priority rule , and not all use the term zebra crossing to describe them . in the uk , the term '' zebra crossing '' only applies to unsignalled crossings ; these have largely been replaced by various types of signalled crossing which restrict the pedestrian 's right to cross to particular time slots .
