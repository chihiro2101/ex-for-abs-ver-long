embryology ( from greek ἔμβρυον , embryon , '' the unborn , embryo '' ; and -λογία , -logy ) is the branch of biology that studies the prenatal development of gametes ( sex cells ) , fertilization , and development of embryos and fetuses . additionally , embryology encompasses the study of congenital disorders that occur before birth , known as teratology . early embryology was proposed by marcello malpighi , and known as preformationism , the theory that organisms develop from pre-existing miniature versions of themselves . then aristotle proposed the theory that is now accepted , epigenesis . epigenesis is the idea that organisms develop from seed or egg in a sequence of steps . modern embryology developed from the work of karl ernst von baer , though accurate observations had been made in italy by anatomists such as aldrovandi and leonardo da vinci in the renaissance .
