forward-looking infrared ( flir ) cameras , typically used on military and civilian aircraft , use a thermographic camera that senses infrared radiation . the sensors installed in forward-looking infrared cameras , as well as those of other thermal imaging cameras , use detection of infrared radiation , typically emitted from a heat source ( thermal radiation ) , to create an image assembled for video output . they can be used to help pilots and drivers steer their vehicles at night and in fog , or to detect warm objects against a cooler background . the wavelength of infrared that thermal imaging cameras detect is 3 to 12 & nbsp ; μm and differs significantly from that of night vision , which operates in the visible light and near-infrared ranges ( 0.4 to 1.0 & nbsp ; μm ) .
