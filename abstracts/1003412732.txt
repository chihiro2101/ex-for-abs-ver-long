in the battle of fuentes de oñoro ( 3–5 may 1811 ) , the british-portuguese army under the duke of wellington checked an attempt by the french army of portugal under marshal andré masséna to relieve the besieged city of almeida . a bloody stalemate was not the sort of battle that had been expected to follow masséna 's expulsion from portugal . his confidence and moral authority having been much boosted by torres vedras , the spring of 1811 found wellington intending to move over to the offensive , for which policy he had received de facto authorization from his political masters in london , where talks of major reductions in the size of the army employed in portugal had been replaced by promises of major reinforcements . supply difficulties , sickness amongst the troops and want of siege artillery ensured that in the short term no great strokes of strategy could be envisaged , but it was hoped that almeida , ciudad rodrigo and badajoz might be all recaptured , thereby opening the way for lightning strikes on such targets as salamanca or seville . in the event , however , success was limited , the story of the rest of 1811 essentially being one of failure and frustration .
