an analog ( or analogue ) synthesizer is a synthesizer that uses analog circuits and analog signals to generate sound electronically . the earliest analog synthesizers in the 1920s and 1930s , such as the trautonium , were built with a variety of vacuum tube ( thermionic valve ) and electro-mechanical technologies . after the 1960s , analog synthesizers were built using operational amplifier ( op-amp ) integrated circuits , and used potentiometers ( pots , or variable resistors ) to adjust the sound parameters . analog synthesizers also use low-pass filters and high-pass filters to modify the sound . while 1960s-era analog synthesizers such as the moog used a number of independent electronic modules connected by patch cables , later analog synthesizers such as the minimoog integrated them into single units , eliminating patch cords in favour of integrated signal routing systems .
