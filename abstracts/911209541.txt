the council of the realm , or simply the council or : sometimes in , was a cabinet of medieval origin , consisting of magnates which advised , and at times co-ruled with , the king of sweden . the 1634 instrument of government , sweden 's first written constitution in the modern sense , stipulated that the king must have a council , but he was free to choose whomever he might find suitable for the job , as long as they were of swedish birth . at the introduction of absolutism , charles xi had the equivalent organ named as royal council . in the age of liberty , the medieval name was reused , but after the bloodless revolution of gustav iii , the old organ was practically abolished . the 1809 instrument of government , created a council of state , also known as the king in council which became the constitutionally mandated cabinet where the king had to make all state decisions in the presence of his cabinet ministers . throughout the 19th century and reaching its culmination with the enactment of the 1974 instrument of government , this new council gradually transformed into an executive cabinet of ministers known as the government , chaired and formed by the prime minister who since 1975 is elected by the riksdag , and which governs the realm independently of a purely figurehead .
