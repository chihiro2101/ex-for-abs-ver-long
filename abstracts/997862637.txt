a radio clock or radio-controlled clock ( rcc ) is a type of quartz clock or watch that is automatically synchronized to a time code transmitted by a radio transmitter connected to a time standard such as an atomic clock . such a clock may be synchronized to the time sent by a single transmitter , such as many national or regional time transmitters , or may use the multiple transmitters used by satellite navigation systems such as gps . such systems may be used to automatically set clocks or for any purpose where accurate time is needed . rc clocks may include any feature available for a clock , such as alarm function , display of ambient temperature and humidity , broadcast radio reception , etc . one common style of radio-controlled clock uses time signals transmitted by dedicated terrestrial longwave radio transmitters , which emit a time code that can be demodulated and displayed by the radio controlled clock . the radio controlled clock will contain an accurate time base oscillator to maintain timekeeping if the radio signal is momentarily unavailable . other radio controlled clocks use the time signals transmitted by dedicated transmitters in the shortwave bands . systems using dedicated time signal stations can achieve accuracy of a few tens of milliseconds . gps satellite receivers also internally generate accurate time information from the satellite signals . dedicated gps timing receivers are accurate to better than 1 & nbsp ; microsecond ; however , general-purpose or consumer grade gps may have an offset of up to one second between the internally calculated time , which is much more accurate than 1 second , and the time displayed on the screen . other broadcast services may include timekeeping information of varying accuracy within their signals .
