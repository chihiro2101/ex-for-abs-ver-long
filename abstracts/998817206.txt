molecular evolution is the process of change in the sequence composition of cellular molecules such as dna , rna , and proteins across generations . the field of molecular evolution uses principles of evolutionary biology and population genetics to explain patterns in these changes . major topics in molecular evolution concern the rates and impacts of single nucleotide changes , neutral evolution vs . natural selection , origins of new genes , the genetic nature of complex traits , the genetic basis of speciation , evolution of development , and ways that evolutionary forces influence genome and phenotype changes .
