braathens asa , until 1997 braathens south american & far east airtransport a/s and trading as braathens safe , was a norway airline which operated from 1946 until it merged with scandinavian airlines ( sas ) in 2004 to become sas braathens . for most of its history , braathens was the largest domestic airline in norway , but did not operate an international network for many years . its main hubs were oslo airport , fornebu and later oslo airport , gardermoen , and briefly stockholm-arlanda airport . the airline operated 118 aircraft of 15 models , the majority of which having been variations of the boeing 737 . braathens served 53 airports and 50 cities with scheduled services through its history . the airline was founded in 1946 by ludvig g . braathen and originally used a fleet of douglas dc-4 aircraft on routes to the far east and south africa . from 1954 the airline was forced to operate all its scheduled flights domestically , where it used de havilland herons . braathens safe retained an international charter service using the dc-3 and dc-6 . as new domestic airports were built , braathens safe and sas were awarded each their share of monopoly route concessions . the fokker f-27 was introduced in 1958 , but was phased out with the delivery of the fokker f-28 and boeing 737-200 jets from 1969 . the last f-27 was phased out in 1975 . after a two-year use of boeing 767 aircraft , braathens operated an all-boeing 737 fleet from 1986 . increased domestic competition on routes started from 1987 , along with braathens safe again starting international routes . by 1994 the fleet had been replaced with boeing 737 classic and domestic deregulation of the airline market was introduced . braathens followed up by listing itself on the oslo stock exchange , joining an alliance with dutch airline klm and expanding its operations to sweden through purchasing transwede and malm√∂ aviation . the 1998 opening of gardermoen resulted in an intense price war with sas and color air , from which braathens never recovered financially . braathens was controlled by braganza until 2001 , when it was sold to the sas group . braathens merged with sas norway on 1 may 2004 .
