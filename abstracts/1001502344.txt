the naginata , is a pole weapon and one of several varieties of traditionally made japanese blades ( nihonto ) . naginata were originally used by the samurai class of feudal japan , as well as by ashigaru ( foot soldiers ) and sōhei ( warrior monks ) . the naginata is the iconic weapon of the onna-bugeisha , a type of female warrior belonging to the japanese nobility . naginata for fighting men and warrior monks were ō-naginata . the kind used by women was called ko-naginata . since the naginata with its pole is heavier and much slower than the japanese sword , the blade of the ko-naginata was smaller than the male warrior 's ō-naginata in order to compensate for the lesser height and upper body strength of a woman than an armoured male samurai .
