the whinchat ( saxicola rubetra ) is a small migratory passerine bird breeding in europe and palearctic and wintering in central africa . at one time considered to be in the thrush family , turdidae , it is now placed in the old world flycatcher family , muscicapidae . both sexes have a strong supercilium , brownish upper parts mottled darker , a pale throat and breast , a pale buff to whitish belly , and a blackish tail with white bases to the outer tail feathers , but in the breeding season , the male has an orange-buff throat and breast . the whinchat is a solitary species , favouring open grassy country with rough vegetation and scattered small shrubs . it perches in elevated locations ready to pounce on the insects and other small invertebrates that form its diet . the nest is built by the female on the ground in coarse vegetation , with a clutch of four to seven eggs being laid . the hen incubates the eggs for about thirteen days and then both parents feed the nestlings . fledging takes place about eighteen days after hatching and the parents continue to feed the young for another fortnight . moulting takes place in late summer before the migration southwards , and again on the wintering grounds in africa before the migration northwards in spring . the whinchat is a common species with a wide range and the international union for conservation of nature has classified it as being of '' least concern '' .
