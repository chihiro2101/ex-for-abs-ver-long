a railway air brake is a railway brake power braking system with compressed air as the operating medium . modern trains rely upon a fail-safe air brake system that is based upon a design patented by george westinghouse on april 13 , 1869 . the westinghouse air brake company was subsequently organized to manufacture and sell westinghouse 's invention . in various forms , it has been nearly universally adopted . the westinghouse system uses air pressure to charge air reservoirs ( tanks ) on each car . full air pressure signals each car to release the brakes . a reduction or loss of air pressure signals each car to apply its brakes , using the compressed air in its reservoirs .
