the leopard ( or leopard 1 ) is a main battle tank designed and produced by porsche in west germany that first entered service in 1965 . developed in an era when heat warheads were thought to make conventional heavy armour of limited value , the leopard focused on firepower in the form of the german-built version of the british l7 105-mm gun , and improved cross-country performance that was unmatched by other designs of the era . the design started as a collaborative project during the 1950s between west germany and france , and later joined by italy , but the partnership ended shortly after and the final design was ordered by the bundeswehr , with full-scale production starting in 1965 . in total , 6,485 leopard tanks have been built , of which 4,744 were battle tanks and 1,741 were utility and anti-aircraft variants , not including 80 prototypes and pre-series vehicles . the leopard quickly became a standard of many european militaries , and eventually served as the main battle tank in over a dozen countries worldwide , with west germany , italy and the netherlands being the largest operators until their retirement . since 1990 , the leopard 1 has gradually been relegated to secondary roles in most armies . in the german army , the leopard 1 was completely phased out in 2003 by the leopard 2 , while leopard 1-based vehicles are still widely used in utility roles . the leopard 2 has replaced the leopard 1 in service with many other nations as well , with derived vehicles using the leopard 1 hull still seeing service . currently , the largest operators are greece , with 520 vehicles , turkey , with 397 vehicles and brazil with 378 vehicles . most of these vehicles have been upgraded with various improvements to armour , firepower and sensors to maintain their ability to engage modern threats .
