chevaline ( pronounced : shev-a-leen ) was a system to improve the penetrability of the warheads used by the uk polaris programme . devised as an answer to the improved soviet a-35 anti-ballistic missile system , the system increased the probability that at least one warhead would penetrate moscow 's anti-ballistic missile ( abm ) defences , something which the royal navy 's earlier ugm-27 polaris re-entry vehicles ( rv ) s were thought to be unlikely to do . chevaline used a variety of penetration aids and decoys to offer so many indistinguishable targets that an opposing abm system would be overwhelmed attempting to deal with them all , ensuring that enough warheads would get through an abm defence to be a reasonable deterrent to a first strike . the project was highly secret , and survived in secrecy through four different governments before being revealed in 1980 . the system was in service from 1982 to 1996 , when the polaris a3t missiles it was fitted to were replaced with the trident d5 .
