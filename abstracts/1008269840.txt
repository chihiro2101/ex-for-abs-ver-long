a gender-specific job title is a name of a job that also specifies or implies the gender of the person performing that job . for example , in english , the job title stewardess implies that the person is female . a gender-neutral job title , on the other hand , is one that does not specify or imply gender , such as firefighter or lawyer . in some cases it may be debatable whether a title is gender-specific ; for example , chairman appears to denote a male ( because of the ending -man ) , but the title is also applied sometimes to women . proponents of gender-neutral language generally advocate the use of gender-neutral job titles , particularly in contexts where the gender of the person in question is not known or not specified . for example , they prefer flight attendant to stewardess or steward , and police officer to policeman or policewoman . in some cases this may involve deprecating the use of certain specifically female titles ( such as authoress ) , thus encouraging the use of the corresponding unmarked form ( such as author ) as a fully gender-neutral title . the above applies to gender neutrality in english and in some other languages without grammatical gender ( where grammatical gender is a feature of a language 's grammar that requires every noun to be placed in one of several classes , often including feminine and masculine ) . in languages with grammatical gender , the situation is altered by the fact that nouns for people are often constrained to be inherently masculine or feminine , and the production of truly gender-neutral titles may not be possible . in such cases , proponents of gender-neutral language may instead focus on ensuring that feminine and masculine words exist for every job , and that they are treated with equal status .
