woodcut is a relief printing technique in printmaking . an artist carves an image into the surface of a block of wood—typically with gouges—leaving the printing parts level with the surface while removing the non-printing parts . areas that the artist cuts away carry no ink , while characters or images at surface level carry the ink to produce the print . the block is cut along the wood grain ( unlike wood engraving , where the block is cut in the end-grain ) . the surface is covered with ink by rolling over the surface with an ink-covered roller ( brayer ) , leaving ink upon the flat surface but not in the non-printing areas . multiple colors can be printed by keying the paper to a frame around the woodblocks ( using a different block for each color ) . the art of carving the woodcut can be called '' xylography '' , but this is rarely used in english for images alone , although that and '' xylographic '' are used in connection with block books , which are small books containing text and images in the same block . they became popular in europe during the latter half of the 15th century . a single-sheet woodcut is a woodcut presented as a single image or print , as opposed to a book illustration . since its origins in china , the practice of woodcut has spread across the world from europe to other parts of asia , and to latin america .
