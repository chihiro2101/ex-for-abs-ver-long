dinitrogen tetroxide , commonly referred to as nitrogen tetroxide ( nto ) , and sometimes , usually among ex-ussr/russia rocket engineers , as amyl , is the chemical compound n 2 o 4 . it is a useful reagent in chemical synthesis . it forms an equilibrium mixture with nitrogen dioxide . dinitrogen tetroxide is a powerful oxidizer that is hypergolic ( spontaneously reacts ) upon contact with various forms of hydrazine , which has made the pair a common bipropellant for rockets .
