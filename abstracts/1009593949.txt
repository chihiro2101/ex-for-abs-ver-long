just war theory ( latin : jus bellum justum ) is a doctrine , also referred to as a tradition , of military ethics studied by military leaders , theologians , ethicists and policy makers . the purpose of the doctrine is to ensure war is morally justifiable through a series of criteria , all of which must be met for a war to be considered just . the criteria are split into two groups : just war theory jus ad bellum and just war theory jus in bello . the first concerns the morality of going to war , and the second the moral conduct within war . recently there have been calls for the inclusion of a third category of just war theory—jus post bellum—dealing with the morality of post-war settlement and reconstruction . just war theory postulates that war , while terrible ( but less so with the right conduct ) , is not always the worst option . important responsibilities , undesirable outcomes , or preventable atrocities may justify war . opponents of just war theory may be either inclined to a stricter pacifism standard ( proposing that there has never been and/or can never be a justifiable basis for war ) or toward a more permissive nationalism standard ( proposing that a war need only serve a nation 's interests to be justifiable ) . in many cases , philosophers state that individuals need not be of guilty conscience if required to fight . a few ennoble the virtues of the soldier while declaring their apprehensions for war itself . a few , such as rousseau , argue for insurrection against oppressive rule . the historical aspect , or the '' just war tradition '' , deals with the historical body of rules or agreements that have applied in various wars across the ages . the just war tradition also considers the writings of various philosophers and lawyers through history , and examines both their philosophical visions of war 's ethical limits and whether their thoughts have contributed to the body of conventions that have evolved to guide war and warfare .
