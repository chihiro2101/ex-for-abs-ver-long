ferdinand christian baur ( 21 june 1792 – 2 december 1860 ) was a german protestant theologian and founder and leader of the ( new ) tübingen school of theology ( named for the university of tübingen where baur studied and taught ) . following hegel 's theory of dialectic , baur argued that early christianity represented the synthesis of two opposing theses : jewish christianity ( petrine christianity ) and gentile christianity ( pauline christianity ) . this and the rest of baur 's work had a profound impact upon higher criticism of biblical and related texts . adolf hilgenfeld followed baur 's lead and edited the tübingen school 's journal , though he was less radical than baur .
