a bug-out bag or bob is a portable kit that normally contains the items one would require to survive for 72 hours when evacuating from a disaster , although some kits are designed to last longer periods . other names for such a bag are a 72-hour kit , battle box , grab bag , go bag , good bag ( get out of dodge ) , personal emergency relocation kit ( perk ) , or quick run bag ( qrb ) . the focus is on evacuation , rather than long-term survival , distinguishing the bug-out bag from a survival kit , an aviation or a boating emergency kit , or a fixed-site disaster supplies kit . the kits are also popular in the survivalism subculture .
