paramecium ( also paramoecium , , , , is a genus of unicellular ciliates , commonly studied as a representative of the ciliate group . paramecia are widespread in freshwater , brackish , and ocean environments and are often very abundant in stagnant basins and ponds . because some species are readily cultivated and easily induced to conjugate and divide , it has been widely used in classrooms and laboratories to study biological processes . its usefulness as a model organism has caused one ciliate researcher to characterize it as the '' white rat '' of the phylum ciliophora .
