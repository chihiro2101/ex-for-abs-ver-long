a lock is a device used for raising and lowering boats , ships and other watercraft between stretches of water of different levels on river and canal waterways . the distinguishing feature of a lock is a fixed chamber in which the water level can be varied ; whereas in a caisson lock , a boat lift , or on a canal inclined plane , it is the chamber itself ( usually then called a caisson ) that rises and falls . locks are used to make a river more easily navigable , or to allow a canal to cross land that is not level . later canals used more and larger locks to allow a more direct route to be taken . since 2016 , the largest lock worldwide is the kieldrecht lock in the port of antwerp , belgium .
