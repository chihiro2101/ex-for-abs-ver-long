the spacing guild is an organization in frank herbert 's science fiction dune universe . with its monopoly on interstellar travel and banking , the power of the guild is balanced against that of the padishah emperor as well as of the assembled noble houses of the landsraad . mutated guild navigators use the spice drug melange to successfully navigate '' folded space '' and safely guide enormous heighliner starships from planet to planet instantaneously . essentially apolitical , the guild is primarily concerned with the flow of commerce and preservation of the economy that supports them ; although their ability to dictate the terms of and fees for all transport gives them influence in the political arena , they do not pursue political goals beyond their economic ones . it is noted in dune ( 1965 ) that houses of the imperium may contract with the guild to be removed '' to a place of safety outside the system '' ; in the past , some houses in danger of ruin or defeat have '' become renegade houses , taking family atomics and shields and fleeing beyond the imperium '' . the guild controls a '' sanctuary planet '' ( or planets ) known as tupile intended for such '' defeated houses of the imperium . location ( s ) known only to the guild and maintained inviolate under the guild peace '' . john c . smith analyzes the concept of the guild in the essay '' navigators and the spacing guild '' in the science of dune ( 2008 ) .
