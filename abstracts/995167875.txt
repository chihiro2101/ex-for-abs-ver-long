the hayes command set ( also known as the at command set ) is a specific command language originally developed by dennis hayes for the hayes smartmodem 300 baud modem in 1981 . the command set consists of a series of short text strings which can be combined to produce commands for operations such as dialing , hanging up , and changing the parameters of the connection . the vast majority of dial-up modems use the hayes command set in numerous variations . the command set covered only those operations supported by the earliest 300 bit/s modems . when new commands were required to control additional functionality in higher speed modems , a variety of one-off standards emerged from each of the major vendors . these continued to share the basic command structure and syntax , but added any number of new commands using some sort of prefix character & nbsp ; â€“ & for hayes and usr , and \ for microcom , for instance . many of these were re-standardized on the hayes extensions after the introduction of the suprafaxmodem 14400 and the market consolidation that followed . the term '' hayes compatible '' was and as of 2018 still is important within the industry .
