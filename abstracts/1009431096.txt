a test card , also known as a test pattern or start-up/closedown test , is a television test signal , typically broadcast at times when the transmitter is active but no program is being broadcast ( often at sign-on and sign-off ) . used since the earliest tv broadcasts , test cards were originally physical cards at which a television camera was pointed , and such cards are still often used for calibration , alignment , and matching of cameras and camcorders . test patterns used for calibrating or troubleshooting the downstream signal path are these days generated by test signal generators , which do not depend on the correct configuration ( and presence ) of a camera , and can also test for additional parameters such as sync , frames per second , and frequency . digitally generated cards allow vendors , viewers and television stations to adjust their equipment for optimal functionality . the audio broadcast while test cards are shown is typically a sine wave tone , radio ( if associated or affiliated with the television channel ) or music ( usually instrumental , though some also broadcast with jazz or popular music ) . more recently , the use of test cards has also expanded beyond television to other digital displays such as large led walls and video projectors .
