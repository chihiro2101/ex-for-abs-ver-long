a black legend is a historiography phenomenon in which a sustained trend in historical writing of biased reporting and introduction of fabricated , exaggerated and/or decontextualized facts is directed against particular persons , nations or institutions with the intention of creating a distorted and uniquely inhuman image of them while hiding their positive contributions to history . the term was first used by french writer arthur lévy in his 1893 work napoléon intime , in contrast to the expression '' golden legend '' that had been in circulation around europe since the publication of a book of that name during the middle ages . black legends have been perpetrated against many nations and cultures , usually as a result of propaganda and xenophobia . for example , the '' black legend ( spain ) '' is the theory that anti-spanish political propaganda , whether about spain , the spanish empire or hispanic america , was sometimes '' absorbed and converted into broadly held stereotypes '' that assumed that spain was '' uniquely evil '' .
