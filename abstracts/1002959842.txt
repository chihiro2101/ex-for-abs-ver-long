urbain jean joseph le verrier frs ( for ) hfrse ; 11 march 1811 – 23 september 1877 ) was a french astronomer and mathematician who specialized in celestial mechanics and is best known for predicting the existence and position of neptune using only mathematics . the calculations were made to explain discrepancies with uranus 's orbit and the laws of kepler and newton . le verrier sent the coordinates to johann gottfried galle in berlin , asking him to verify . galle found neptune in the same night he received le verrier 's letter , within 1° of the predicted position . the discovery of neptune is widely regarded as a dramatic validation of celestial mechanics , and is one of the most remarkable moments of 19th-century science .
