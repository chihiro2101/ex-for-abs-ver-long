a-side and b-side are terms frequently used to refer to the two sides of phonograph record and cassettes , often directly on the labels of two-sided music recording themselves . the a-side usually features a recording that its artist , producer , or record company intends to receive the initial promotional effort and radio airplay and hopefully become a hit record . the b-side ( or '' flip-side '' ) is a secondary recording that typically receives less attention , although some b-sides have been equally or more successful than their a-sides . use of this language has largely declined in the early 21st century , given that the music industry has transitioned away from analog recordings towards digital audio , such as cds , downloads and streaming , which do not have physical sides . nevertheless , some artists and labels continue to employ the terms a-side and b-side metaphorically to describe the type of content a particular release features , with b-side sometimes representing a '' bonus '' track or other material .
