john atkinson hobson ( 6 july 1858 â€“ 1 april 1940 ) was an english economist and social science . hobson is best known for his writing on imperialism , which influenced vladimir lenin and his theory of underconsumption . his principal and earliest contribution to economics was the theory of underconsumption , a scathing criticism of say 's law and classical economics ' emphasis on thrift . however , this discredited hobson among the professional economics community from which he was ultimately excluded . other early work critiqued the classical theory of rent and anticipated the neoclassical '' marginal productivity '' theory of distribution . after covering the second boer war as a correspondent for the guardian , he condemned british involvement in the war and characterised it as acting under the influence of mine owners . in a series of books , he explored the associations between imperialism and international conflict and asserted that imperial expansion is driven by a search for new markets and investment opportunities overseas . commentaries on hobson have noted the presence of antisemitic language and themes in his work , especially in his writing on the boer war . later , he argued that maldistribution of income resulted , through oversaving and underconsumption , in unemployment and that the remedy was in eradicating the '' surplus '' by the redistribution of income by taxation and the nationalization of monopolies . he opposed the first world war and advocated the formation of a world political body to prevent wars . following the war , he became a reformist socialist .
