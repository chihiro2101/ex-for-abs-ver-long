in computer science , specifically software engineering and hardware engineering , formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically rigorous techniques for the specification , development and verification of software and hardware systems . the use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that , as in other engineering disciplines , performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design . formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals , in particular logic calculi , formal languages , automata theory , discrete event dynamic system and program semantics , but also type systems and algebraic data types to problems in software and hardware specification and verification . monin , pp.3-4
