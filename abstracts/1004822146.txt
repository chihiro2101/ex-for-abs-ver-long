thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation generated by the thermal motion of particles in matter . all matter with a temperature greater than absolute zero emits thermal radiation . particle motion results in charge-acceleration or dipole oscillation which produces electromagnetic radiation . infrared radiation emitted by animals ( detectable with an infrared camera ) and cosmic microwave background radiation are examples of thermal radiation . if a radiation object meets the physical characteristics of a black body in thermodynamic equilibrium , the radiation is called blackbody radiation . k . huang , statistical mechanics ( 2003 ) , p.278 planck 's law describes the spectrum of blackbody radiation , which depends solely on the object 's temperature . wien 's displacement law determines the most likely frequency of the emitted radiation , and the stefanâ€“boltzmann law gives the radiant intensity . k . huang , statistical mechanics ( 2003 ) , p.280 thermal radiation is also one of the fundamental mechanisms of heat transfer .
