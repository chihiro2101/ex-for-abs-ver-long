kerogen is solid , insoluble organic matter in sedimentary rocks . consisting of an estimated 10 16 tons of carbon , it is the most abundant source of organic compounds on earth , exceeding the total organic content of living matter 10,000-fold . it is insoluble in normal organic solvents and it does not have a specific chemical formula . upon heating , kerogen converts in part to liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons . petroleum and natural gas form from kerogen . kerogen may be classified by its origin : lacustrine ( e.g . , algae ) , marine ( e.g . , planktonic ) , and terrestrial ( e.g . , pollen and spores ) . the name '' kerogen '' was introduced by the scottish organic chemist alexander crum brown in 1906 , oxford english dictionary 3rd ed . ( 2003 ) steuart , d.r . , in cadell , h.m . et al . oil-shales of lothians iii . 142 ( 1906 ) '' we are indebted to professor crum brown , f.r.s . , for suggesting the term kerogen to express the carbonaceous matter in shale that gives rise to crude oil in distillation . '' derived from the greek for '' wax birth '' ( greek : κηρός '' wax '' and -gen , γένεση '' birth '' ) . increasing production of hydrocarbons from shale has motivated a revival of research into the composition , structure , and properties of kerogen . many studies have documented dramatic and systematic changes in kerogen composition across the range of thermal maturity relevant to the oil and gas industry . analyses of kerogen are generally performed on samples prepared by acid demineralization with supercritical drying , which isolates kerogen from the rock matrix without altering its chemical composition or microstructure .
