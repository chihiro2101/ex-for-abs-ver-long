thumb the vega program ( cyrillic : вега ) was a series of venus missions that also took advantage of the appearance of comet 1p/halley in 1986 . vega 1 and vega 2 were uncrewed spacecraft launched in a cooperative effort among the soviet union ( who also provided the spacecraft and launch vehicle ) and austria , bulgaria , france , hungary , the east germany , poland , czechoslovakia , and the west germany in december 1984 . they had a two-part mission to investigate venus and also flyby halley 's comet . the flyby of halley 's comet had been a late mission change in the venera program following on from the cancellation of the american halley mission in 1981 . a later venera mission was canceled and the venus part of the vega 1 mission was reduced . because of this , the craft was designated vega , a contraction of venera and gallei ( венера and галлей respectively , the russian words for '' venus '' and '' halley '' ) . the spacecraft design was based on the previous venera 9 and venera 10 missions . the two spacecraft were launched on 15 and 21 december 1984 , respectively . with their redesignated dual missions , the vega probes became part of the halley armada , a group of space probes that studied halley 's comet during its 1985/1986 perihelion .
