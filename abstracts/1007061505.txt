mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road , often over rough terrain , usually using specially designed mountain bikes . mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain , such as air or coil-sprung shocks used as suspension , larger and wider wheels and tyres , stronger frame materials , and mechanically or hydraulically actuated disc brakes . mountain biking can generally be broken down into five distinct categories : cross country , trail riding , all mountain ( also referred to as '' enduro '' ) , downhill , and freeride . this sport requires endurance , core strength and balance , bike handling skills , and self-reliance . advanced riders pursue both steep technical descents and high incline climbs . in the case of freeride , downhill , and dirt jumping , aerial maneuvers are performed off both natural features and specially constructed jumps and ramps . mountain bikers ride on off-road trails such as singletrack , back-country roads , wider bike park trails , firebreak , and some advanced trails are designed with jumps , berms , and drop-offs to add excitement to the trail . riders with enduro and downhill bikes will often visit ski resorts that stay open in the summer to ride downhill-specific trails , using the ski lifts to return to the top with their bikes . because riders are often far from civilization , there is a strong element of self-reliance in the sport . riders learn to repair broken bikes and flat tires to avoid being stranded . many riders carry a backpack , including water , food , tools for trailside repairs , and a first aid kit in case of injury . group rides are common , especially on longer treks . mountain bike orienteering adds the skill of map navigation to mountain biking .
