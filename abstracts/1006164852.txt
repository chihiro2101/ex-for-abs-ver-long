the shipping forecast is a bbc radio broadcast of weather reports and forecasts for the seas around the coasts of the british isles . it is produced by the met office and broadcast by bbc radio 4 on behalf of the maritime and coastguard agency . the forecasts sent over the navtex system use a similar format and the same sea areas . the waters around the british isles are divided into 31 sea areas , also known as weather areas ( see map below ) . there are currently four broadcasts per day at the following ( uk local ) times : 0048 – transmitted on fm and lw . includes weather reports from an extended list of coastal stations at 0052 and an inshore waters forecast at 0055 and concludes with a brief uk weather outlook for the coming day . the broadcast finishes at approximately 0058 . 0520 – transmitted on fm and lw . includes weather reports from coastal stations at 0525 , and an inshore waters forecast at 0527 . 1201 – normally transmitted on lw only . 1754 – transmitted only on lw on weekdays , as an opt-out from the pm ( radio 4 ) , but at weekends transmitted on both fm and lw . the 0048 , 1201 and 1754 forecasts are read by the duty announcer , but the 0520 forecast is read by the weather forecaster ( there being no separate radio 4 continuity operation at that time ) . the unique and distinctive presentation style of these broadcasts has led to their attracting an audience much wider than that directly interested in maritime weather conditions . in august 2017 , radio 4 celebrated the service 's 150th anniversary .
