in genetics and developmental biology , somatic cell nuclear transfer ( scnt ) is a laboratory strategy for creating a viable embryo from a body cell and an egg cell . the technique consists of taking an enucleated oocyte ( egg cell ) and implanting a donor nucleus from a somatic ( body ) cell . it is used in both therapeutic and reproductive cloning . in 1996 , dolly ( sheep ) became famous for being the first successful case of the reproductive cloning of a mammal . in january 2018 , a team of scientists in shanghai announced the successful cloning of two female crab-eating macaques ( named zhong zhong and hua hua ) from fetal nuclei . '' therapeutic cloning '' refers to the potential use of scnt in regenerative medicine ; this approach has been championed as an answer to the many issues concerning embryonic stem cells ( escs ) and the destruction of viable embryos for medical use , though questions remain on how homologous the two cell types truly are .
