image : charles wheatstone - project gutenberg etext 13103.jpg thumbnail the playfair system was invented by charles wheatstone , who first described it in 1854 . the playfair cipher or playfair square or wheatstone–playfair cipher is a manual symmetric encryption technique and was the first literal digram substitution cipher . the scheme was invented in 1854 by charles wheatstone , but bears the name of lord playfair for promoting its use . the technique encrypts pairs of letters ( bigrams or digrams ) , instead of single letters as in the simple substitution cipher and rather more complex vigenère cipher systems then in use . the playfair is thus significantly harder to break since the frequency analysis used for simple substitution ciphers does not work with it . the frequency analysis of bigrams is possible , but considerably more difficult . with 600 no duplicate letters are allowed , and one letter is omitted ( q ) or combined ( i/j ) , so the calculation is 600 25×24 . possible bigrams rather than the 26 possible monograms ( single symbols , usually letters in this context ) , a considerably larger cipher text is required in order to be useful .
