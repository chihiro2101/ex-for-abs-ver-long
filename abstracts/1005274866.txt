the bearded vulture ( gypaetus barbatus ) , also known as the lammergeier and ossifrage , is a bird of prey and the only member of the genus gypaetus . this bird is also identified as huma bird or huma bird in iran and north west asia . traditionally considered an old world vulture , it actually forms a minor lineage of accipitridae together with the egyptian vulture ( neophron percnopterus ) , its closest living relative . it is not much more closely related to the old world vultures proper than to , for example , hawks , and differs from the former by its feathered neck . although dissimilar , the egyptian and bearded vulture each have a lozenge-shaped tailâ€”unusual among birds of prey . the population of this species continues to decline . in 2004 , it was classified by the iucn red list as least concern ; since 2014 , it is listed as near threatened . the bearded vulture is the only known vertebrate whose diet consists almost exclusively ( 70 to 90 percent ) of bone . it lives and breeds on crags in high mountains in southern europe , the caucasus , africa , the indian subcontinent , and tibet , laying one or two eggs in mid-winter that hatch at the beginning of spring . populations are residents .
