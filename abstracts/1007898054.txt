jury nullification ( us ) , jury equity ( uk ) , or a perverse verdict ( uk ) generally occurs when members of a trial jury believe that a defendant is guilty , but choose to acquit the defendant anyway , because the jurors consider that the law itself is unjust , that the prosecutor has misapplied the law in the defendant 's case , or that the potential punishment for breaking the law is too harsh . some juries have also refused to convict due to their own prejudices in favour of the defendant . nullification is not an official part of criminal procedure , but is the logical consequence of two rules governing the systems in which it exists : jurors can not be punished for reaching a '' wrong '' decision ( such as acquitting a defendant despite their guilt being proven beyond a reasonable doubt ) . a defendant who is acquitted double jeopardy for the same offence . a jury verdict that is contrary to the letter of the law pertains only to the particular case before it . however , if a pattern of acquittals develops in response to repeated attempts to prosecute a particular offence , this can have the de facto effect of invalidating the law . such a pattern may indicate public opposition to an unwanted legislative enactment . it may also happen that a jury convicts a defendant even if no law was broken , although such a conviction may be overturned on appeal . nullification can also occur in civil trials .
