in economics , capital consists of human-created assets that can enhance one 's power to perform economically useful work . for example , a stone arrowhead is capital for a hunter-gatherer who can use it as a hunting instrument ; similarly , roads are capital for inhabitants of a city . capital is distinct from land and other non-renewable resources in that it can be increased by human labor , and does not include certain durable goods like homes and personal automobiles that are not used in the production of saleable goods and services . adam smith defined capital as '' that part of man 's stock which he expects to afford him revenue '' . in economic models , capital is an input in the production function . the total physical capital at any given moment in time is referred to as the capital stock ( not to be confused with the stock of a business entity ) . capital goods , real capital , or capital assets are already-produced , durable goods or any non-financial asset that is used in production of goods or services . in marxian economics , capital is money used to buy something only in order to sell it again to realize a profit . for marx , capital only exists within the process of the economic cycle ( represented by m-c-m ' ) â€”it is wealth that grows out of the process of circulation itself , and for marx it formed the basis of the economic system of capitalism . in more contemporary schools of economics , this form of capital is generally referred to as '' financial capital '' and is distinguished from '' capital goods '' .
