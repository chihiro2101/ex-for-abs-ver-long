boy scouts of america et al . v . dale , 530 u.s . 640 ( 2000 ) , was a landmark decision of the us supreme court , decided on june 28 , 2000 , that held that the constitutional right to freedom of association allowed the boy scouts of america ( bsa ) to exclude a homosexual person from membership in spite of a state law requiring equal treatment of homosexuals in public accommodations . more generally , the court ruled that a private organization such as the bsa may exclude a person from membership when '' the presence of that person affects in a significant way the group 's ability to advocate public or private viewpoints '' . . in a five to four decision , the supreme court ruled that opposition to homosexuality is part of bsa 's '' expressive message '' and that allowing homosexuals as adult leaders would interfere with that message . the ruling reversed a decision of the new jersey supreme court that had determined that new jersey 's public accommodations law required the bsa to readmit assistant scoutmaster james dale , who had come out and whom the bsa had expelled from the organization for that reason . subsequently , the bsa lifted their bans on gay scouts and gay leaders in 2013 and 2015 , respectively .
