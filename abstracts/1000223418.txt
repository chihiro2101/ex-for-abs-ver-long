a rodeo clown , bullfighter ( in the united states , canada , australia and new zealand ) or rodeo protection athlete , is a rodeo performer who works in bull riding competitions . originally , the rodeo clown was a single job combining '' bullfighting '' â€”the protection of riders thrown from the bull , as well as being an individual who provided comic relief . today in the united states , the job is split into two separate ones : bullfighters who protect the riders from the bull , and entertainers ( barrelmen ) who provides comic humor . however , in other parts of the world and at some small rodeos , the jobs of rodeo rider protection and comic remain combined .
