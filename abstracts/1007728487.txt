the national advisory committee for aeronautics ( naca ) was a united states federal agency founded on march 3 , 1915 , to undertake , promote , and institutionalize aeronautical research . on october 1 , 1958 , the agency was dissolved and its assets and personnel were transferred to the newly created nasa ( nasa ) . naca is an initialism , i.e . , pronounced as individual letters , rather than as a whole word murray , charles , and catherine bly cox . apollo . south mountain books , 2004 , p . xiii . ( as was nasa during the early years after being established ) . among other advancements , naca research and development produced the naca duct , a type of air intake used in modern automotive applications , the naca cowling , and several series of naca airfoils , which are still used in aircraft manufacturing . during world war ii , naca was described as '' the force behind our air supremacy '' due to its key role in producing working superchargers for high altitude bombers , and for producing the laminar wing profiles for the north american p-51 mustang . naca also helped in developing the area rule that is used on all modern supersonic aircraft , and conducted the key compressibility research that enabled the bell x-1 to break the sound barrier .
