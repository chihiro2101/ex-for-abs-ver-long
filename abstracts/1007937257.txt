the corinth canal connects the gulf of corinth in the ionian sea with the saronic gulf in the aegean sea . it cuts through the narrow isthmus of corinth and separates the peloponnese from the greek mainland , arguably making the peninsula an island . the canal was dug through the isthmus at sea level and has no locks . it is in length and only wide at its base , making it impassable for many modern ships . it has little economic importance and is mainly a tourist attraction . the canal was initially proposed in classical times and a failed effort was made to build it in the 1st century ad . construction recommenced in 1881 but was hampered by geological and financial problems that bankrupted the original builders . it was completed in 1893 , but , due to the canal 's narrowness , navigational problems , and periodic closures to repair landslides from its steep walls , it failed to attract the level of traffic expected by its operators .
