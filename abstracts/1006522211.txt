optical communication , also known as optical telecommunication , is communication at a distance using light to carry information . it can be performed visually or by using electronics . the earliest basic forms of optical communication date back several millennia , while the earliest electrical device created to do so was the photophone , invented in 1880 . an optical communication system uses a transmitter , which encodes a message into an optical signal , a channel , which carries the signal to its destination , and a receiver , which reproduces the message from the received optical signal . when electronic equipment is not employed the 'receiver ' is a person visually observing and interpreting a signal , which may be either simple ( such as the presence of a beacon ) or complex ( such as lights using color codes or flashed in a morse code sequence ) . free-space optical communication has been deployed in space , while terrestrial forms are naturally limited by geography , weather and the availability of light . this article provides a basic introduction to different forms of optical communication .
