ecotopia : the notebooks and reports of william weston is a utopian novel by ernest callenbach , published in 1975 . the society described in the book is one of the first ecological utopias and was influential on the counterculture and the green politics in the 1970s and thereafter . the author himself claimed that the society he depicted in the book is not a true utopia ( in the sense of a perfect society ) , but , while guided by societal intentions and values , was imperfect and in-process . callenbach said of the story , in relation to americans : '' it is so hard to imagine anything fundamentally different from what we have now . but without these alternate visions , we get stuck on dead center . and we ’ d better get ready . we need to know where we ’ d like to go .
