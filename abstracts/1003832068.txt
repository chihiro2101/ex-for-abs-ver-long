a yawl is a type of boat . the term has several meanings . it can apply to the rig ( or sailplan ) , to the hull type or to the use which the vessel is put . as a rig , a yawl is a two masted , fore-and-aft rig sailing vessel with the mizzen mast positioned abaft ( behind ) the rudder stock , or in some instances , very close to the rudder stock . this is different from a ketch , where the mizzen mast is forward of the rudder stock . the sail area of the mizzen on a yawl is consequentially notably smaller than the same sail on a ketch . , double-ended , traditional working craft that operated from the beaches of the british isles . these boats are considered to be linked to the viking or nordic design tradition . most of these types are now extinct , but they include the norfolk and sussex beach yawls ( called '' yols '' by the men who crewed them ) , which were probably the fastest-sailing open boats ever built . a yawl is also a type of ships boat . the definition , size , number of oars and sailing rig varied over time . this was one of the normal working boats carried by a ship in the age of sail . in local usage , the term yawl was sometimes applied to working craft which did not fit any of the definitions given above . an example of this is the whitstable yawl , a decked gaff-cutter-rigged fishing smack that dredged for oysters . the etymology of '' yawl '' is obscure - especially considering the different meanings of the word .
