saint anthony falls , or the falls of saint anthony , northeast of downtown minneapolis , minnesota , was the only natural major waterfall on the upper mississippi river . the natural falls were replaced by a concrete overflow spillway ( also called an '' apron '' ) after it partially collapsed in 1869 . later , in the 1950s and 1960s , a series of locks and dams was constructed to extend navigation to points upstream . the falls are named after the catholic saint anthony of padua . the towns of st . anthony and minneapolis , which had developed on the east and west sides of the falls , respectively , merged in 1872 to fully use the power of the falls for milling operations . from 1880 to about 1930 , minneapolis was the '' flour milling capital of the world '' . today , the falls are defined by the locks and dams of the upper saint anthony falls , just downstream of the 3rd avenue bridge , and the lower saint anthony falls , just upstream of the i-35w saint anthony falls bridge . these locks were built as part of the upper mississippi river 9-foot navigation project . the area around the falls is designated the st . anthony falls historic district and features a self-guided walking trail with signs explaining the area 's past .
