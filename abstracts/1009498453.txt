image : interplanetary superhighway.jpg thumb 350px this stylized depiction of the itn is designed to show its ( often convoluted ) path through the solar system . the green ribbon represents one path from among the many that are mathematically possible along the surface of the darker green bounding tube . locations where the ribbon changes direction abruptly represent trajectory changes at lagrange points , while constricted areas represent locations where objects linger in temporary orbit around a point before continuing on . the interplanetary transport network ( itn ) is a collection of gravitationally determined pathways through the solar system that require very little energy for an object to follow . the itn makes particular use of lagrange points as locations where trajectories through space can be redirected using little or no energy . these points have the peculiar property of allowing objects to orbit around them , despite lacking an object to orbit . while it would use little energy , transport along the network would take a long time . the interplanetary superhighway ; shane ross ; virginia tech .
