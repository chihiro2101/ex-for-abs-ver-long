differentiated services or diffserv is a computer networking architecture that specifies a simple and scalable mechanism for classifying and managing network traffic and providing quality of service ( qos ) on modern ip networks . diffserv can , for example , be used to provide low-latency to critical network traffic such as voice or streaming media while providing simple best-effort service to non-critical services such as web traffic or file transfers . diffserv uses a 6-bit differentiated services code point ( dscp ) in the 8-bit differentiated services field ( ds field ) in the ip header for packet classification purposes . the ds field replaces the outdated ipv4 tos field .
