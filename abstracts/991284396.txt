avgas ( aviation gasoline , also known as aviation spirit in the uk ) is an aviation fuel used in aircraft with spark-ignited internal combustion engines . avgas is distinguished from conventional gasoline ( petrol ) used in motor vehicles , which is termed mogas ( motor gasoline ) in an aviation context . unlike motor gasoline , which has been formulated since the 1970s to allow the use of platinum-content catalytic converters for pollution reduction , the most commonly used grades of avgas still contain tetraethyllead ( tel ) , a toxic substance used to prevent engine knocking ( detonation ) . there are ongoing experiments aimed at eventually reducing or eliminating the use of tel in aviation gasoline . kerosene-based jet fuel is formulated to suit the requirements of turbine engines which have no octane requirement and operate over a much wider flight envelope than piston engines . kerosene is also used by most diesel piston engines developed for aviation use , such as those by sma engines , austro engine , and thielert .
