fiberglass ( american english ) , or fibreglass ( commonwealth english ) is a common type of fibre-reinforced plastic using glass fiber . the fibers may be randomly arranged , flattened into a sheet ( called a chopped strand mat ) , or woven into a fabric . the plastic matrix may be a thermoset polymer matrix—most often based on thermosetting polymers such as epoxy , polyester resin , or vinylester—or a thermoplastic . cheaper and more flexible than carbon fiber , it is stronger than many metals by weight , is non-magnetic , non-conductive , transparent to electromagnetic radiation , can be molded into complex shapes , and is chemically inert under many circumstances . applications include aircraft , boats , automobiles , bath tubs and enclosures , swimming pools , hot tubs , septic tanks , water tanks , roofing , pipes , cladding , orthopedic casts , surfboards , and external door skins . other common names for fiberglass are glass-reinforced plastic ( grp ) , glass-fiber reinforced plastic ( gfrp ) or gfk ( from . because glass fiber itself is sometimes referred to as '' fiberglass '' , the composite is also called '' fiberglass reinforced plastic '' . this article will adopt the convention that '' fiberglass '' refers to the complete glass fiber reinforced composite material , rather than only to the glass fiber within it .
