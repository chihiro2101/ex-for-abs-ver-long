thumb a communication channel refers either to a physical transmission medium such as a wire , or to a logical connection over a multiplexed medium such as a radio channel in telecommunications and computer networking . a channel is used to convey an information signal , for example a digital bit stream , from one or several senders ( or transmitters ) to one or several receivers . a channel has a certain capacity for transmitting information , often measured by its bandwidth in hz or its data rate in bit rate . communicating data from one location to another requires some form of pathway or medium . these pathways , called communication channels , use two types of media : cable ( twisted-pair wire , cable , and fiber-optic cable ) and broadcast ( microwave , satellite , radio , and infrared ) . cable or wire line media use physical wires of cables to transmit data and information . twisted-pair wire and coaxial cables are made of copper , and fiber-optic cable is made of glass . in information theory , a channel refers to a theoretical channel model with certain error characteristics . in this more general view , a storage device is also a kind of channel , which can be sent to ( written ) and received from ( reading ) .
