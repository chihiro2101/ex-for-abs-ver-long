the powerpc 7xx is a family of third generation 32-bit powerpc microprocessors designed and manufactured by ibm and motorola ( now freescale semiconductor ) . this family is called the powerpc g3 by its well-known customer apple inc . , which introduced it on november 10 , 1997 . the term '' powerpc g3 '' is often , and incorrectly , imagined to be a microprocessor when in fact a number of microprocessors from different vendors have been used . such designations were applied to macintosh computers such as the powerbook g3 , the imac g3 , ibooks and several desktops , including both the beige and blue and white power macintosh g3s . the low power requirements and small size made the processors ideal for laptops and the name lived out its last days at apple in the ibook . the 7xx family is also widely used in embedded devices like printers , routers , storage devices , spacecraft , and video game consoles . the 7xx family had its shortcomings , namely lack of smp support and simd capabilities and a relatively weak fpu . motorola 's 74xx range of processors picked up where the 7xx left off .
