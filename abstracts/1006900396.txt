the battle of seneffe took place on 11 august 1674 near seneffe in present-day belgium and was one of the most notable engagements of the franco-dutch war . it was fought between a french army commanded by the grand condé and a combined dutch , imperial , and spain force led by william of orange . one of only three battles in the spanish netherlands during the war , seneffe was the most expensive in terms of casualties , although estimates vary considerably . after successfully repulsing the allied assault , condé launched a series of counter-attacks against the advice of his subordinates . defeat ended allied hopes of invading northern france , but french losses shocked louis xiv , who thereafter focused on sieges , the dominant form of warfare in the late 17th century . of the two other battles fought in this theatre , cassel was an attempt to relieve saint-omer , while saint-denis was fought to prevent the fall of mons .
