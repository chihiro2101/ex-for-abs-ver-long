post-processual archaeology , which is sometimes alternately referred to as the interpretative archaeologies by its adherents , joh99 . pp . 98–99 . joh10 . p . 105 . is a movement in archaeological theory that emphasizes the subjectivity of archaeological interpretations . despite having a vague series of similarities , post-processualism consists of '' very diverse strands of thought coalesced into a loose cluster of traditions '' . joh99 . p . 101 . within the post-processualist movement , a wide variety of theoretical viewpoints have been embraced , including structuralism and neo-marxism , as have a variety of different archaeology techniques , such as phenomenology . the post-processual movement originated in the united kingdom during the late 1970s and early 1980s , pioneered by archaeologists such as ian hodder , daniel miller , christopher tilley and peter ucko , who were influenced by french marxism anthropology , postmodernism and similar trends in cultural anthropology . parallel developments soon followed in the united states . initially post-processualism was primarily a reaction to and critique of processual archaeology , a paradigm developed in the 1960s by 'new archaeologists ' such as lewis binford , and which had become dominant in anglophone archaeology by the 1970s . post-processualism was heavily critical of a key tenet of processualism , namely its assertion that archaeological interpretations could , if the scientific method was applied , come to completely objective conclusions . in the united states , archaeologists widely see post-processualism as an accompaniment to the processual movement , while in the united kingdom , they remain largely thought of as separate and opposing theoretical movements . in other parts of the world , post-processualism has made less of an impact on archaeological thought . tri07 . pp . 477–478 .
