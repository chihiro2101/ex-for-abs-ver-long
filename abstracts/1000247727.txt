manglish is an informal form of malaysian english with features of an english-based creole principally used in malaysia . it is heavily influenced by the dominant languages of the country , malay , chinese languages , and tamil . it is not an official language . manglish spoken in west malaysia is very similar to and highly mutually intelligible with singlish , a creole of similar roots . there is little distinction between the two creoles except that manglish vocabulary contains more malay words while singlish contains more words of hokkien and teochew origin . the vocabulary of manglish consists of words originating from english , malay , min nan , mandarin , cantonese , tamil , and , to a lesser extent , various other european languages , while manglish syntax resembles southern varieties of chinese . also , elements of american and australian slang have come through from imported television series . the malaysian manglish is sometimes known as rojak or bahasa rojak , but it differs from the rojak language by the use of english as the base language . the term rojak derives from '' mixture '' or '' eclectic mix '' in colloquial malay . the east coast versions ( kelantan and terengganu ) of manglish may differ greatly from that of west coast malaysian speakers .
