tuple calculus is a calculus that was created and introduced by edgar f . codd as part of the relational model , in order to provide a declarative database-query language for data manipulation in this data model . it formed the inspiration for the database-query languages quel and sql , of which the latter , although far less faithful to the original relational model and calculus , is now the de facto standard database-query language ; a dialect of sql is used by nearly every relational database management system . michel lacroix and alain pirotte proposed domain calculus , which is closer to first-order logic and together with codd showed that both of these calculi ( as well as relational algebra ) are equivalent in expressive power . subsequently , query languages for the relational model were called relationally complete if they could express at least all of these queries .
