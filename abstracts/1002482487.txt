turtle fibropapillomatosis ( fp ) is a disease of sea turtles . the condition is characterized by benign but ultimately debilitating epithelium tumours on the surface of biological tissues . fp exists all over the world , but it is most prominent in warmer climates , affecting up to 50â€“70 % of some populations . the causative agent of the disease is believed to be chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 ( chhv-5 ) , a species of virus in the genus scutavirus , subfamily alphaherpesvirinae , family herpesviridae , and order herpesvirales . turtle leeches are suspected mechanical vectors , transmitting the disease to other individuals . the disease is thought to have a multifactorial cause , including a tumour-promoting phase that is possibly caused by biotoxins or contaminants .
