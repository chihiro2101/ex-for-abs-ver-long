a nocturnal emission , informally known as a wet dream , sex dream , nightfall or sleep orgasm , is a spontaneous orgasm during sleep that includes ejaculation for a male , or vaginal wetness or an orgasm ( or both ) for a female . nocturnal emissions are most common during adolescence and early young adult years , but they may happen any time after puberty . it is possible for men to wake up during a wet dream or simply to sleep through it , but for women , some researchers have added the requirement that she should also awaken during the orgasm and perceive that the orgasm happened before it counts as a wet dream . vaginal lubrication alone does not mean that the woman has had an orgasm .
