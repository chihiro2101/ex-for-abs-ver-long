a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator ( csprng ) or cryptographic pseudorandom number generator ( cprng ) is a pseudorandom number generator ( prng ) with properties that make it suitable for use in cryptography . it is also loosely known as a cryptographic random number generator ( crng ) ( see random number generation '' true '' vs . pseudo-random numbers ) . most cryptography require random numbers , for example : key generation nonces salts in certain signature schemes , including ecdsa , pkcs 1 the '' quality '' of the randomness required for these applications varies . for example , creating a nonce in some protocols needs only uniqueness . on the other hand , the generation of a master key requires a higher quality , such as more entropy . and in the case of one-time pads , the information theory guarantee of perfect secrecy only holds if the key material comes from a true random source with high entropy , and thus any kind of pseudorandom number generator is insufficient . ideally , the generation of random numbers in csprngs uses entropy obtained from a high-quality source , generally the operating system 's randomness api . however , unexpected correlations have been found in several such ostensibly independent processes . from an information-theoretic point of view , the amount of randomness , the entropy that can be generated , is equal to the entropy provided by the system . but sometimes , in practical situations , more random numbers are needed than there is entropy available . also , the processes to extract randomness from a running system are slow in actual practice . in such instances , a csprng can sometimes be used . a csprng can '' stretch '' the available entropy over more bits .
