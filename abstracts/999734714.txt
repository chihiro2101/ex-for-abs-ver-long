a jet aircraft ( or simply jet ) is an aircraft ( nearly always a fixed-wing aircraft ) propelled by jet engines . whereas the engines in propeller ( aircraft ) generally achieve their maximum efficiency at much lower speeds and altitudes , jet engines achieve maximum efficiency at speeds close to or even well above the speed of sound . jet aircraft generally cruise most efficiently at about mach 0.8 and at altitudes around or more . the idea of the jet engine was not new , but the technical problems involved could not begin to be solved until the 1930s . frank whittle , an english inventor and raf officer , began development of a viable jet engine in 1928 , and hans von ohain in germany began work independently in the early 1930s . in august 1939 the turbojet powered heinkel he 178 , the world 's first jet aircraft , made its first flight . a wide range of different types jet aircraft exist , both for civilian and military purposes .
