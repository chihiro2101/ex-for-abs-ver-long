a microrna ( abbreviated mirna ) is a small single-stranded non-coding rna molecule ( containing about 22 nucleotides ) found in plants , animals and some viruses , that functions in rna silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression . mirnas function via base-pairing with complementary sequences within mrna molecules . as a result , these mrna molecules are silenced , by one or more of the following processes : ( 1 ) cleavage of the mrna strand into two pieces , ( 2 ) destabilization of the mrna through shortening of its poly ( a ) tail , and ( 3 ) less efficient translation of the mrna into proteins by ribosomes . mirnas resemble the small interfering rna of the rna interference pathway , except mirnas derive from regions of rna transcripts that fold back on themselves to form short hairpins , whereas sirnas derive from longer regions of double-stranded rna . the human genome may encode over 1900 mirnas , homo sapiens mirnas in the mirbase at manchester university although more recent analysis indicates that the number is closer to 600 . mirnas are abundant in many mammalian cell types and as extracellular circulating mirnas . circulating mirnas are released into body fluids including blood and cerebrospinal fluid and have the potential to be available as biomarkers in a number of diseases . mirnas appear to target about 60 % of the genes of humans and other mammals . many mirnas are evolutionarily conserved , which implies that they have important biological functions . for example , 90 families of mirnas have been conserved since at least the common ancestor of mammals and fish , and most of these conserved mirnas have important functions , as shown by studies in which genes for one or more members of a family have been knocked out in mice .
