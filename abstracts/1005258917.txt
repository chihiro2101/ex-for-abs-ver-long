body worlds ( german title : k√∂rperwelten ) is a traveling exposition of dissected human bodies , animals , and other anatomy structures of the body that have been preserved through the process of plastination . gunther von hagens developed the preservation process which '' unites subtle anatomy and modern polymer chemistry '' , in the late 1970s . a series of body worlds anatomical exhibitions has toured many countries worldwide , sometimes raising controversies about the sourcing and display of actual human corpses and body parts . von hagens maintains that all human specimens were obtained with full knowledge and consent of the donors before they died , but this has not been independently verified , and in 2004 hagens returned seven corpses to china because they showed evidence of being executed prisoners . a competing exhibition , bodies : the exhibition , openly sources its bodies from '' unclaimed bodies '' in china , which can include executed prisoners .
