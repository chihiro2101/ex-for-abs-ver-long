image : drain runoff in kharkiv.jpg thumb urban runoff entering a storm drain stormwater , also spelled storm water , is water that originates from rain , including snow and ice melt . stormwater can soak into the soil ( infiltrate ) , be stored on the land surface in ponds and puddles , evaporate , or contribute to surface runoff . most runoff is conveyed directly to nearby streams , rivers , or other water bodies ( surface water ) without treatment . in natural landscapes , such as forests , soil absorbs much of the stormwater . plants also reduce stormwater by improving infiltration , intercepting precipitation as it falls , and by taking up water through their roots . in developed environments , unmanaged stormwater can create two major issues : one related to the volume and timing of runoff ( flooding ) and the other related to potential contaminants the water is carrying ( water pollution ) . stormwater is also an important resource as human population and demand for water grow , particularly in arid and drought-prone climates . stormwater harvesting techniques and purification could potentially make some urban environments self-sustaining in terms of water .
