in nuclear engineering , fissile material is material capable of sustaining a nuclear fission chain reaction . by definition , fissile material can sustain a chain reaction with neutrons of thermal energy . the predominant neutron energy may be typified by either slow neutrons ( i.e . , & nbsp ; a thermal system ) or fast neutrons . fissile material can be used to fuel thermal-neutron reactors , fast-neutron reactors and nuclear explosives .
