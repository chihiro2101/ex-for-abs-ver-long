consensus decision-making or consensus politics ( often abbreviated to consensus ) is group decision-making processes in which participants develop and decide on proposals with the aim , or requirement , of acceptance by all . the focus on avoiding negative opinion differentiates consensus from unanimity , which requires all participants to positively support a decision . consensus comes from latin meaning '' agreement , accord , '' which in turn comes from consentire , meaning '' feel together '' . both the process and outcome of consensus decision-making are referred to as consensus ( e.g . '' by consensus '' and '' a consensus '' respectively ) .
