the battle of fleurus , fought on 1 july 1690 , was a major engagement of the nine years ' war . in a bold and masterful envelopment , marshal luxembourg , commanding a french army of some 35,000 men , inflicted a severe defeat on prince waldeck ’ s allied force of approximately 38,000 men . waldeck lost 50 % of his army and luxembourg moved ahead to control flanders . although the battle was a brilliant tactical feat and the french war minister , louvois , wished to press ahead and secure further success , king louis overruled him and ordered luxembourg to reinforce the dauphin ’ s army on the rhine and forgo any major siege . the allies , meanwhile , withdrew to brussels to recover and rebuild their forces .
