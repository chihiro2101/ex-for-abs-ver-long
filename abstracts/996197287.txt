a marcher lord was a noble appointed by the king of england to guard the border ( known as the welsh marches ) between england and wales . a marcher lord was the english equivalent of a margrave ( in the holy roman empire ) or a marquis ( in france ) before the introduction of the title of '' marquess '' in britain ( no marcher lord ever bore this rank ) . in this context the word march means a border region or frontier , and is cognate with the verb '' to march , '' both ultimately derived from proto-indo-european mereg- , '' edge '' or '' boundary '' . the greatest marcher lords included the earls of chester , gloucester , hereford , pembroke and shrewsbury ( see also english earls of march ) .
