in economics and finance , risk aversion is the tendency of people to prefer outcomes with low uncertainty to those outcomes with high uncertainty , even if the average outcome of the latter is equal to or higher in monetary value than the more certain outcome . risk aversion explains the inclination to agree to a situation with a more predictable , but possibly lower payoff , rather than another situation with a highly unpredictable , but possibly higher payoff . for example , a risk-averse investor might choose to put their money into a bank account with a low but guaranteed interest rate , rather than into a stock that may have high expected returns , but also involves a chance of losing value .
