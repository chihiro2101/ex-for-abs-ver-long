'' f-14 condensation cloud in action '' . web.archive.org . retrieved : august 30 , 2010 . the sound barrier or sonic barrier is the sudden increase in aerodynamic drag and other undesirable effects experienced by an aircraft or other object when it approaches the speed of sound . when aircraft first approached the speed of sound , these effects were seen as constituting a barrier making faster speeds very difficult or impossible . sonic barrier . thefreedictionary.com . sound barrier . oxforddictionaries.com . the term sound barrier is still sometimes used today to refer to aircraft reaching supersonic speed . flying faster than sound produces a sonic boom . in dry air at 20 & nbsp ; °c ( 68 & nbsp ; °f ) , the speed of sound is 343 metres per second ( about 767 & nbsp ; mph , 1234 & nbsp ; km/h or 1,125 & nbsp ; ft/s ) . the term came into use during world war ii when pilots of high-speed fighter aircraft experienced the effects of compressibility , a number of adverse aerodynamic effects that deterred further acceleration , seemingly impeding flight at speeds close to the speed of sound . these difficulties represented a barrier to flying at faster speeds . in 1947 , american test pilot chuck yeager demonstrated that safe flight at the speed of sound was achievable in purpose-designed aircraft , thereby breaking the barrier . by the 1950s , new designs of fighter aircraft routinely reached the speed of sound , and faster .
