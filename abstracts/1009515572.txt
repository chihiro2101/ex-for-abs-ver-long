in human biology , handedness is the better , faster , or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand , known as the dominant hand . the incapable , less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand . . ( '' nondominant '' is one of 945 words listed under '' non- '' ) right-handedness is most common ; about 90 % of people are right-handed . handedness is often defined by one 's writing hand , as it is fairly common for people to prefer to do some tasks with each hand . there are examples of true ambidexterity ( equal use of either hand ) , but it is rare—most people prefer one hand for most purposes . most of the current research suggests that left-handedness has an epigenetic marker—a combination of genetics , biology and the environment . because the vast majority of the population is right-handed , many devices are designed for use by right-handed people , making their use by left-handed people more difficult . in many countries , left-handed people are or were required to write with their right hands . left-handed people are also more prone to certain health problems . however , left-handed people have an advantage in sports that involve aiming at a target in an area of an opponent 's control , as their opponents are more accustomed to the right-handed majority . as a result , they are over-represented in baseball , tennis , fencing , cricket , boxing and mma .
