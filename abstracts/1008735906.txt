the shipworms are marine bivalve molluscs in the family teredinidae : a group of saltwater clams with long , soft , naked bodies . they are notorious for boring into ( and commonly eventually destroying ) wood that is immersed in sea water , including such structures as wooden piers , docks and ships ; they drill passages by means of a pair of very small shells borne at one end , with which they rasp their way through . sometimes called '' termites of the sea '' , they also are known as '' teredo worms '' or simply teredo , from the greek tered≈çn , via latin . eventually biologists adopted the common name teredo as the name for the best-known genus .
