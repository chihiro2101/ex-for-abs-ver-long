a software synthesizer , also known as a softsynth or software instrument , is a computer program or plug-in that generates digital audio , usually for music . computer software that can create sounds or music is not new , but advances in processing speed now allow softsynths to accomplish the same tasks that previously required the dedicated hardware of a conventional synthesizer . softsynths may be readily interfaced with other music software such as music sequencers typically in the context of a digital audio workstation . softsynths are usually less expensive and can be more portable than dedicated hardware .
