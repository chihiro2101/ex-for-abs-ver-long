the legitimacy under international law of the 1999 nato bombing of yugoslavia has been seriously questioned . the un charter is the foundational legal document of the united nations ( un ) and is the cornerstone of the public international law governing the use of force between states . nato members are also subject to the north atlantic treaty , but its use of force provision is superseded by the non-derogable prohibition of the use of force contained in the charter , which allows only two exceptions : action taken by the security council under chapter vii , and self-defence against an armed attack . neither of these exceptions were fulfilled in this case . critics of the bombing have argued that the campaign violated international humanitarian law . supporters of the nato bombing of yugoslavia argued that the bombing brought to an end the ethnic cleansing of kosovo 's albanian population , and that it hastened ( or caused ) the downfall of slobodan milošević 's government , which they saw as having been responsible for the international isolation of yugoslavia , war crimes , and human rights violations .
