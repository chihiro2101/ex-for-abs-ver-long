the great chain of being is a hierarchical structure of all matter and life , thought by medieval christianity to have been decreed by god . the chain begins with god and descends through angels , humans , animals , and plants , to minerals . the great chain of being , '' ladder of being '' ) is a concept derived from plato , aristotle ( in his historia animalium ) , plotinus and proclus . further developed during the middle ages , it reached full expression in early modern neoplatonism . '' this idea of a great chain of being can be traced to plato 's division of the world into the forms , which are full beings , and sensible things , which are imitations of the forms and are both being and not being . aristotle 's teleology recognized a perfect being , and he also arranges all animals by a single natural scale according to the degree of perfection of their souls . the idea of the great chain of being was fully developed in neoplatonism and in the middle ages .
