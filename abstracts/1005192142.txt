ultra high frequency ( uhf ) is the itu designation for radio frequency in the range between 300 & nbsp ; megahertz ( mhz ) and 3 & nbsp ; gigahertz ( ghz ) , also known as the decimetre band as the wavelengths range from one meter to one tenth of a meter ( one decimeter ) . radio waves with frequencies above the uhf band fall into the super-high frequency ( shf ) or microwave frequency range . lower frequency signals fall into the vhf ( very high frequency ) or lower bands . uhf radio waves propagate mainly by line of sight ; they are blocked by hills and large buildings although the transmission through building walls is strong enough for indoor reception . they are used for television broadcasting , cell phones , satellite communication including gps , personal radio services including wi-fi and bluetooth , walkie-talkies , cordless phones , and numerous other applications . the ieee defines the uhf radar band as frequencies between 300 & nbsp ; mhz and 1 & nbsp ; ghz . two other ieee radar bands overlap the itu uhf band : the l band between 1 and 2 & nbsp ; ghz and the s band between 2 and 4 & nbsp ; ghz . , is widely used at uhf frequencies .
