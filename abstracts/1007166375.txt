lewis roberts binford ( november 21 , 1931 & nbsp ; & ndash ; april 11 , 2011 ) was an american archaeology known for his influential work in archaeological theory , ethnoarchaeology and the paleolithic period . he is widely considered among the most influential archaeologists of the later 20th century , and is credited with fundamentally changing the field with the introduction of processual archaeology ( or the '' new archaeology '' ) in the 1960s . binford 's influence was controversial , however , and most theoretical work in archaeology in the late 1980s and 1990s was explicitly construed as either a reaction to or in support of the processual paradigm . recent appraisals have judged that his approach owed more to prior work in the 1940s and 50s than suggested by binford 's strong criticism of his predecessors .
