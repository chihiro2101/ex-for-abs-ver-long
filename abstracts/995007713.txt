in computer security , a dmz or demilitarized zone ( sometimes referred to as a perimeter network or screened subnet ) is a physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an organization 's external-facing services to an untrusted , usually larger , network such as the internet . the purpose of a dmz is to add an additional layer of security to an organization 's local area network ( lan ) : an external network node can access only what is exposed in the dmz , while the rest of the organization 's network is firewalled . the dmz functions as a small , isolated network positioned between the internet and the private network . the name is from the term '' demilitarized zone '' , an area between states in which military operations are not permitted .
