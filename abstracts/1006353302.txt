liturgical colours are those specific colours used for vestments and hangings within the context of christian liturgy . the symbolism of violet , white , green , red , gold , black , rose and other colours may serve to underline moods appropriate to a season of the liturgical year or may highlight a special occasion . there is a distinction between the colour of the vestments worn by the clergy and their choir dress , which with a few exceptions does not change with the seasons of the liturgical year .
