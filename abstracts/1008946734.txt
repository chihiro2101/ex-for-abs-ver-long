bethnal green is a london underground station in bethnal green , london , served by the central line . it lies between liverpool street and mile end stations , is in travelcard zone 2 , and is open 24 hours on a friday and saturday as part of the night tube service . the station was opened as part of the long planned central line eastern extension on 4 december 1946 , having previously been used as an air raid shelter . on 3 march 1943 , 173 people , including 62 children , were killed in a crush while attempting to enter the shelter , in what is believed to be the largest loss of civilian life in the uk during the second world war . the station is an example of the style adopted by london transport for new tube stations under the new works programme of 1935â€“1940 . extensive use is made of pale yellow tiling , originally manufactured by poole pottery . this has been replicated during the 2007 modernisation although several panels of original tiling were retained on the platforms . the finishes include relief tiles , showing symbols of london and the area served by the london passenger transport board , designed by harold stabler . the station entrances , all in the form of subway access staircases to the subterranean ticket hall , all show the design influences of charles holden , the consulting architect for london transport at this time .
