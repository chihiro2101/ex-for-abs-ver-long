according to author george lepre , the total number of known and suspected fragging cases by explosives in vietnam from 1969 to 1972 totaled nearly 900 with 99 deaths and many injuries . this total is incomplete as some cases were not reported , nor were statistics kept before 1969 although several incidents from 1966 to 1968 are known . most of the victims or intended victims were officers or non-commissioned officers . the number of fraggings increased in 1970 and 1971 even though the u.s . military was withdrawing and the number of u.s . military personnel in vietnam was declining . an earlier calculation by authors richard a . gabriel and paul l . savage , estimated that up to 1,017 fragging incidents may have taken place in vietnam causing 86 deaths and 714 injuries of u.s . military personnel , the majority officers and ncos . gabriel , richard a . and savage , paul l . ( 1978 ) , crisis in command , new york : hill & wang , p . 183 fragging statistics include only incidents involving explosives , most commonly grenades . several hundred murders of u.s . soldiers by firearms occurred in vietnam but most were of enlisted men killing enlisted men of nearly equal rank . fewer than 10 officers are known to have been murdered by firearms . however , rumors and claims abound of deliberate killing of officers and non-commissioned officers by enlisted men under battlefield conditions . the frequency and number of these fraggings , indistinguishable from combat deaths , can not be quantified .
