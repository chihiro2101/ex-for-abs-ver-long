in decision theory and systems theory , a mindset is a set of assumptions , methods , or notions held by one or more people or groups of people . a mindset can also be seen as arising out of a person 's world view or philosophy of life . a mindset may be so firmly established that it creates a powerful incentive within these people or groups to continue to adopt or accept prior behaviors , choices , or tools . the latter phenomenon is also sometimes described as mental inertia , '' groupthink '' , and it is often difficult to counteract its effects upon analysis and decision making processes . in cognitive psychology , a mindset represents the cognitive processes activated in response to a given task ( french , 2016 ) .
