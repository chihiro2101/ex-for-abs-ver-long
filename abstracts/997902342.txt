mezzotint is a printmaking process of the intaglio family , using a drypoint method . it was the first grayscale to be used , enabling half-tones to be produced without using line- or dot-based techniques like hatching , cross-hatching or stipple . mezzotint achieves tonality by roughening a metal plate with thousands of little dots made by a metal tool with small teeth , called a '' rocker '' . in printing , the tiny pits in the plate retain the ink when the face of the plate is wiped clean . this technique can achieve a high level of quality and richness in the print . mezzotint is often combined with other intaglio techniques , usually etching and engraving . the process was especially widely used in england from the eighteenth century , to reproduce portraits and other paintings . it was somewhat in competition with the other main tonal technique of the day , aquatint . since the mid-nineteenth century it has been relatively little used , as lithography and other techniques produced comparable results more easily . robert kipniss and peter ilsted are two notable 20th-century exponents of the technique ; m . c . escher also made eight mezzotints .
