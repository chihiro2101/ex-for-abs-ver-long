the red telephone box , a telephone booth for a payphone designed by giles gilbert scott , is a familiar sight on the streets of the united kingdom , malta , bermuda and gibraltar . despite a reduction in their numbers in recent years , the traditional british red telephone kiosk can still be seen in many places throughout the uk , and in current or former british colonies around the world . the colour red was chosen to make them easy to spot . from 1926 onwards , the fascias of the kiosks were emblazoned with a prominent crown , representing the british government . the red phone box is often seen as a british cultural icon throughout the world . in 2006 the k2 telephone box was voted one of britain 's top 10 design icons , which included the mini , supermarine spitfire , tube map , world wide web , concorde and the aec routemaster bus . although production of the traditional boxes ended with the advent of the kx series in 1985 , many still stand in britain .
