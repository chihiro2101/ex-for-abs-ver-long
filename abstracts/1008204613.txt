malory does not use nimue 's name for the lady of the lake associated with lancelot , who too goes unnamed and may be considered the third one ( it is highly possible that he had only access to the suite du merlin part of the post-vulgate cycle as a source ) . in the end , a female hand emerging from a lake reclaims excalibur in a miraculous scene when the sword is thrown into the water by sir bedivere just after battle of camlann . malory then counts nimue among the magical queens who arrive in a black boat with morgan . together , they bear the mortally wounded arthur away to avalon .
