in 1811 the novelist walter scott passed by the castle and later used it as the location for his novel ivanhoe , published in 1819 . scott only had a partial view of the property from the road and the events portrayed in the novel , set at the end of the 12th century , are fictitious ; scott believed the castle to have been saxon in origin , a view shared by many 19th-century commentators . ; although the writer john wainwright was still able to praise the '' picturesque view '' around the castle in 1826 , the antiquarian ecroyd smith commented with concern in 1887 on the changing character of the location , in particular the factories that were growing up around the new railway line and the '' murky atmosphere '' the industrial works created . in 1859 francis d'arcy-osborne , the duke of leeds , died , leaving conisbrough to his nephew , sackville lane-fox , the baron conyers . the keep remained in good condition , but by 1884 it was apparent that repairs were needed and the antiquarian george clark recommended urgent work to repair the stonework . if finances allowed it , he also urged the reinstallation of a roof and wooden floors . limited repairs were subsequently approved by the trustees of lord conyers , although clark 's colleague , a . ellis , expressed concerns that railings to protect the visitors who routinely climbed to the top of the keep had not been funded . a reported Â£500 was spent by the trustees renovating the castle ruins , including the construction of a lodge in the outer bailey for the castle keeper , completed in 1885 , and improvements to the footpaths . ;
