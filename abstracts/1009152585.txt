anticoagulants , commonly known as blood thinners , are chemical substances that prevent or reduce coagulation of blood , prolonging the clotting time . some of them occur naturally in hematophagy animals such as leeches and mosquitoes , where they help keep the bite area unclotted long enough for the animal to obtain some blood . as a class of medications , anticoagulants are used in therapy for thrombosis . oral anticoagulants ( oacs ) are taken by many people in pill or tablet form , and various intravenous anticoagulant dosage forms are used in hospitals . some anticoagulants are used in medical equipment , such as sample tubes , blood transfusion bags , heart-lung machines , and dialysis equipment . one of the first anticoagulants , warfarin , was initially approved as a rodenticide . anticoagulants are closely related to antiplatelet drugs and thrombolytic drugs by manipulating the various pathways of blood coagulation . specifically , antiplatelet drugs inhibit platelet aggregation ( clumping together ) , whereas anticoagulants inhibit specific pathways of the coagulation cascade , which happens after the initial platelet aggregation and ultimately leads to formation of fibrin and stable aggregated platelet products . common anticoagulants include warfarin and heparin .
