the newtek video toaster is a combination of hardware and software for the editing and production of ntsc standard-definition video . the plug-in expansion card initially worked with the amiga 2000 computer and provides a number of bnc connectors on the exposed rear edge that provide connectivity to common analog video sources like vhs . the related software tools support vision mixer , chroma keying , character generator , animation , and photo manipulation . together , the hardware and software provided in the early 1990s a low-cost video editing suite for a few thousand u.s . dollars that rivaled the output of professional systems costing ten times as much at the time . it allowed small studios to produce high-quality material and resulted in a cottage industry for video production not unlike the success of the macintosh in the desktop publishing ( dtp ) market only a few years earlier . the video toaster won the emmy award for technical achievement in 1993 . â™™ other parts of the original software package were spun off as stand-alone products , notably lightwave 3d , and achieved success on their own . as the amiga platform lost market share and commodore international went bankrupt in 1994 as a result of declining sales , the video toaster was moved to the microsoft windows platform where it is still available . the company also produces what is essentially a portable pre-packaged version of the video toaster along with all the computer hardware needed , as the tricaster . these became all-digital units in 2014 , ending production of the analog video toaster line .
