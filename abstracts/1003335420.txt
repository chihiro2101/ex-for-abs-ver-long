in science , a british first class honours ( 3 years ) is not equivalent to an australian first class honours ( 1 year research postgraduate programme that requires a completed undergraduate ( pass ) degree with a high grade-point average ) . in scientific research , it is commonly accepted that an australian postgraduate honours is equivalent to a british master 's degree ( in research ) . there has been some debate over the acceptance of a three-year honours degree ( as in the case of graduates from british universities ) as the equivalent entry requirement to graduate research programmes ( m.phil . , ph.d . ) in australian universities . the letters of honours programmes also added to the confusion . for example : b.sc . ( hons ) are the letters gained for postgraduate research honours at the university of queensland . b.sc . ( hons ) does not indicate that this honours are postgraduate qualification . the difficulty also arises between different universities in australiaâ€”some universities have followed the uk system .
