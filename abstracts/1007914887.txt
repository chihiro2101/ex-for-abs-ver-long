in its native northern hemisphere range , the first-year male common blackbird of the nominate race may start singing as early as late january in fine weather in order to establish a territory , followed in late march by the adult male . the male 's song is a varied and melodious low-pitched fluted warble , given from trees , rooftops or other elevated perches mainly in the period from march to june , sometimes into the beginning of july . it has a number of other calls , including an aggressive seee , a pook-pook-pook alarm for terrestrial predators like cats , and various chink and chook , chook vocalisations . the territorial male invariably gives chink-chink calls in the evening in an ( usually unsuccessful ) attempt to deter other blackbirds from roosting in its territory overnight . during the northern winter , blackbirds can be heard quietly singing to themselves , so much so that september and october are the only months in which the song can not be heard . like other passerine birds , it has a thin high seee alarm call for threats from bird of prey since the sound is rapidly attenuated in vegetation , making the source difficult to locate . at least two subspecies , t . m . merula and t . m . nigropileus , will mimic other species of birds , cats , humans or alarms , but this is usually quiet and hard to detect .
