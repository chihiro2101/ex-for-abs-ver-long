the oxford canal is a narrow canal in central england linking oxford with bedworth ( between coventry and nuneaton on the coventry canal ) via banbury and rugby . completed in 1790 , it connects to the river thames at oxford and is integrated with the grand union canal & mdash ; combined for close to the villages of braunston and napton-on-the-hill , a canal which soon after construction superseded much of its traffic . the canal was for about 15 years the main canal artery of trade between the midlands and london ; it retained importance in its local county economies and that of berkshire . today the canal is frequently used for weekend and holiday narrowboat pleasure boating . the oxford canal traverses oxfordshire , northamptonshire and east warwickshire through broad , shallow valleys and lightly rolling hills ; resembling the bulk of the grand union canal and its branches , much of the landscape is similar to the those of the llangollen and lancaster canals . it has frequent wharves and public houses , particularly if including the parts of the grand union canal immediately adjoining . north of about a third of its distance , namely from napton , the canal 's route northeast and then northwest forms part of the warwickshire ring . at its southern extremity it forms a waterway circuit within oxford known as the four rivers .
