extensible messaging and presence protocol ( xmpp , originally named jabber ) is an open communication protocol designed for instant messaging ( im ) , presence information , and contact list maintenance . based on xml ( extensible markup language ) , it enables the near-real-time exchange of structured data between any two or more network entities . designed to be extensible , the protocol offers a multitude of applications beyond traditional im in the broader realm of message-oriented middleware , including signalling for voip , video , file transfer , game and other uses . unlike most commercial instant messaging protocols , xmpp is defined in an open standard in the application layer . the architecture of the xmpp network is similar to email ; anyone can run their own xmpp server and there is no central master server . this federated open system approach allows users to interoperate with others on any server using a 'jid ' user account , similar to an email address . xmpp implementations can be developed using any software license and many server , client , and library implementations are distributed as free and open-source software . numerous freeware and commercial software implementations also exist . originally developed by the eponymous open-source community , the protocols were formalized as an approved instant messaging standard in 2004 and has been continuously developed with new extensions and features . various xmpp client software are available on both desktop and mobile platforms and devices - by 2003 the protocol was used by over ten million people worldwide on the network , according to the xmpp standards foundation .
