the liskeard and looe union canal was a broad canal between liskeard and looe in cornwall , united kingdom . it was almost long and had 24 locks , and it opened progressively from 1827 . the engineer was robert coad . its primary purpose originally was the carriage of sea sand and lime to improve the acid soil of agricultural lands , but when mineral deposits on caradon hill were exploited , it benefited considerably , carrying the mineral down to looe harbour . the trade increased so much that a railway—the liskeard and looe railway—was built alongside its course by the canal company , and the canal itself gradually ceased to be navigable .
