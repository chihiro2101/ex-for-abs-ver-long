prefect ( from the latin praefectus , substantive adjectival adam 's latin grammar form of praeficere : '' put in front '' , i.e . , in charge ) is a magistrate title of varying definition , but essentially refers to the leader of an administrative area . a prefect 's office , department , or area of control is called a prefecture , but in various post-roman empire cases there is a prefect without a prefecture or vice versa . the words '' prefect '' and '' prefecture '' are also used , more or less conventionally , to render analogous words in other languages , especially romance languages .
