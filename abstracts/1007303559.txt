in radio , longwave , long wave or long-wave , and commonly abbreviated lw , refers to parts of the radio spectrum with wavelengths longer than what was originally called the medium-wave broadcasting band . the term is historic , dating from the early 20th century , when the radio spectrum was considered to consist of longwave ( lw ) , medium wave ( mw ) , and short-wave ( sw ) radio bands . most modern radio systems and devices use wavelengths which would then have been considered 'ultra-short ' . in contemporary usage , the term longwave is not defined precisely , and its intended meaning varies . it may be used for radio wavelengths longer than 1,000 & nbsp ; m i.e . frequencies up to 300 & nbsp ; kilohertz ( khz ) , including the international telecommunication union ( itu 's ) low frequency ( lf , 30–300 & nbsp ; khz ) and very low frequency ( vlf , 3–30 & nbsp ; khz ) bands . sometimes the upper limit is taken to be higher than 300 & nbsp ; khz , but not above the start of the medium wave broadcast band at 520 & nbsp ; khz . in europe , africa , and large parts of asia ( international telecommunication union region ) , where a range of frequencies between 148.5 and 283.5 & nbsp ; khz is used for am broadcasting in addition to the medium wave band , the term longwave usually refers specifically to this broadcasting band , which falls wholly within the low frequency band of the radio spectrum ( 30–300 & nbsp ; khz ) . the '' longwave club of america '' ( united states ) is interested in '' frequencies below the am broadcast band '' ( i.e . , all frequencies below 520 & nbsp ; khz ) .
