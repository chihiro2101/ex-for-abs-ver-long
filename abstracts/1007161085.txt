a library catalog ( or library catalogue in british english ) is a register of all bibliography items found in a library or group of libraries , such as a network of libraries at several locations . a bibliographic item can be any information entity ( e.g . , books , computer files , graphics , realia , cartographic materials , etc . ) that is considered library material ( e.g . , a single novel in an anthology ) , or a group of library materials ( e.g . , a trilogy ) , or linked from the catalog ( e.g . , a webpage ) as far as it is relevant to the catalog and to the users ( patrons ) of the library . the card catalog was a familiar sight to library users for generations , but it has been effectively replaced by the online public access catalog ( opac ) . some still refer to the online catalog as a '' card catalog '' . for example , the website of the childress public library in childress , texas refers to its online catalog as a '' card catalog '' : another example of the term '' card catalog '' used to refer to an online catalog is in an instructional presentation produced by the hayner public library district , which serves townships around alton , illinois : some libraries with opac access still have card catalogs on site , but these are now strictly a secondary resource and are seldom updated . many libraries that retain their physical card catalog will post a sign advising the last year that the card catalog was updated . some libraries have eliminated their card catalog in favor of the opac for the purpose of saving space for other use , such as additional shelving . the largest international library catalog in the world is the worldcat union catalog managed by the non-profit library cooperative oclc . in july 2020 , worldcat had almost 500,000 catalog records and over 3 billion library holdings .
