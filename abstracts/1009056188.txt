the media of canada is diverse and highly regionalized . news media , both print and digital and in both official languages , is largely dominated by a handful of major media corporations . the largest of these corporations is the country ’ s national public broadcaster , cbc/radio-canada , who also plays a significant role in producing domestic cultural content , operating radio and tv networks in both english and french . non-news media content in canada , including film and television , is influenced both by local creators as well as by imports from the united states , the united kingdom , australia , and france . while canadian content has historically failed to substantively penetrate foreign markets , this has begun shifting in recent years as platforms like netflix and cbc gem enable those media traditionally only popular within canada to reach foreign audiences . television , magazines , and newspapers are primarily for-profit corporations based on advertising , subscription , and other sales-related revenues . nevertheless , both the television-broadcasting and publications sectors require a number of government interventions to remain profitable , which can include regulation barring foreign companies in the broadcasting industry , as well as tax laws that limit foreign competition in magazine advertising . in addition to cbc , some provincial governments offer their own public educational tv broadcast services as well , such as tvontario and télé-québec . the organization reporters without borders compiles and publishes an annual ranking of countries based upon the organization 's assessment of their press freedom index . in 2011–12 , canada was ranked 10th out of 179 countries in the world , which was an improvement from the preceding year . in 2020 , canada ranked 16 out of 180 .
