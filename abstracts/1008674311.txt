the world line ( or worldline ) of an object is the path that object traces in 4-dimensional spacetime . it is an important concept in modern physics , and particularly theoretical physics . the concept of a '' world line '' is distinguished from concepts such as an '' orbit '' or a '' trajectory '' ( e.g . , a planet 's orbit in space or the trajectory of a car on a road ) by the time dimension , and typically encompasses a large area of spacetime wherein perception straight paths are recalculated to show their ( relatively ) more absolute position statesâ€”to reveal the nature of special relativity or gravitational interactions . the idea of world lines originates in physics and was pioneered by hermann minkowski . the term is now most often used in relativity theories ( i.e . , special relativity and general relativity ) .
