ribaldry or blue comedy is humorous entertainment that ranges from bordering on indelicacy to gross morality . blue comedy is also referred to as '' bawdiness '' or being '' bawdy '' . sex is presented in ribald material more for the purpose of poking fun at the foibles and weaknesses that manifest themselves in human sexuality , rather than to present sexual stimulation either overtly or artistically . also , ribaldry may use sex as a metaphor to illustrate some non-sexual concern , in which case ribaldry borders satire . like any humour , ribaldry may be read as conventional or subversive . ribaldry typically depends on a shared background of sexual conventions and values , and its comedy generally depends on seeing those conventions broken . the ritual taboo-breaking that is a usual counterpart of ribaldry underlies its controversial nature and explains why ribaldry is sometimes a subject of censorship . ribaldry , whose usual aim is not '' merely '' to be sexually stimulating , often does address larger concerns than mere sexual appetite . however , being presented in the form of comedy , these larger concerns may be overlooked by censors . ribaldry differs from black comedy in that the latter deals with topics which would normally be considered painful or frightening , whereas ribaldry deals with topics that would only be considered offensive .
