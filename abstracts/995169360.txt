in graph theory , a cycle in a graph is a non-empty trail in which the only repeated vertices are the first and last vertices . a directed cycle in a directed graph is a non-empty directed trail in which the only repeated vertices are the first and last vertices . a graph without cycles is called an acyclic graph . a directed graph without directed cycles is called a directed acyclic graph . a connected graph without cycles is called a tree .
