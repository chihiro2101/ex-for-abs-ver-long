the additional member system ( ams ) , also known as mixed-member proportional representation ( mmp ) outside the united kingdom , is a mixed electoral system with one tier of single-member district legislator , and another tier of ‘ additional members ’ elected to make the overall election results more proportional . the term additional member system , introduced by the hansard society , has been largely replaced in the literature by the term mixed member proportional coined by new zealand 's royal commission on the electoral system ( 1984–1986 ) . this article focuses primarily on semi-proportional implementations of mmp designed to yield moderately proportional election results , similar to the mixed systems used in the uk and referred to locally as ams . in scotland , wales , and the london assembly , the fixed numbers of additional members , elected in relatively small regions , are not always sufficient to fully compensate for the disproportionality caused by the single-member district ( first-past-the-post voting ) tier .
