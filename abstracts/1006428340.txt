the battle of malplaquet was fought near the border of france on 11 september 1709 and was a major engagement of the war of the spanish succession . it pitted a french army , commanded by marshal duke of villars and marshal duke of boufflers , against an allied army , led by the duke of marlborough and prince eugene of savoy . after a string of defeats , failure of the harvest and the prospect of invasion , louis xiv of france had appealed to french patriotism , recruited fresh soldiers and instructed villars to use the country 's last army to give battle against marlborough 's formidable force . after a series of manoeuvres , villars settled on a position in which both of his flanks were anchored in woods . even though the french were outnumbered , marlborough 's familiar tactics of flank attacks to draw off troops from the centre incurred serious attrition by massed french musket and skillful use of artillery . when marlborough 's assault on the denuded enemy centre came , his allied army had been so badly weakened that the allies made no attempt at pursuit when the french retreated in good order . the allies lost 20,000 men , twice as many as the french , which was regarded by contemporaries as a shocking number of casualties . that caused britain to question the sacrifices that might be required for marlborough 's campaign to continue . the battle of malplaquet is often regarded as a grand alliance pyrrhic victory due to the casualties suffered by the allies , which delayed them considerably and ensured that the british and dutch governments would never again allow their armies to engage in field battles on such a scale for the remainder of the war . at malplaquet , the allies were left in control of the battlefield and went on to capture mons but villars and boufflers ' ferocious efforts in the battle turned out to have effectively prevented an invasion of france by the grand alliance and the french position stabilised .
