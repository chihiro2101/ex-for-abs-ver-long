gawsworth old hall is a grade & nbsp ; i listed country house in the village of gawsworth , cheshire , england . it is a timber-framed house in the cheshire black-and-white style . the present house was built between 1480 and 1600 , replacing an earlier norman house . it was probably built as a courtyard house enclosing a quadrangle , but much of it has been demolished , leaving the house with a u-shaped plan . the present hall was owned originally by the fitton family , and later by the gerards , and then the stanhopes . since the 1930s it has been in the possession of the richards family . raymond richards collected a number of items from other historic buildings and incorporated them into the hall . notable residents have included mary fitton , perhaps the '' dark lady '' of shakespeare 's sonnets , and samuel '' maggoty '' johnson , a playwright described as the last professional jester in england , whose grave is nearby in maggoty wood , a small national trust woodland . in 1712 a dispute about the ownership of the gawsworth estate culminated in a celebrated duel , in which both the combatants were killed . the hall is surrounded by formal gardens and parkland , which once comprised an elizabethan pleasure garden and , possibly , a tilting ground for jousting . the grounds are listed grade & nbsp ; ii , and contain four grade & nbsp ; ii listed buildings , including the gatehouse , gatepiers , and garden walls . the hall and grounds are open to the public at advertised times , and events are organised . during the summer months a series of concerts and other entertainment is arranged in an open-air theatre near the hall .
