in photography , exposure is the amount of light per unit area ( the image plane illuminance times the exposure time ) reaching a frame of photographic film or the surface of an electronic image sensor , as determined by shutter speed , lens f-number , and scene luminance . exposure is measured in lux seconds , and can be computed from exposure value ( ev ) and scene luminance in a specified region . an '' exposure '' is a single shutter cycle . for example , a long exposure refers to a single , long shutter cycle to gather enough dim light , whereas a multiple exposure involves a series of shutter cycles , effectively layering a series of photographs in one image . the accumulated photometric exposure ( h v ) is the same so long as the total exposure time is the same .
