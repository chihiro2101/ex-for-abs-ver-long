a magnetohydrodynamic drive or mhd accelerator is a method for propelling vehicles using only electric and magnetic fields with no moving parts , accelerating an electrically conductive propellant ( liquid or gas ) with magnetohydrodynamics . the fluid is directed to the rear and as a reaction , the vehicle accelerates forward . the first studies examining mhd in the field of marine propulsion date back to the early 1960s . few large-scale working prototypes have been built , as marine mhd propulsion remains impractical due to its low efficiency , limited by the low electrical conductivity of seawater . increasing current density is limited by joule heating and water electrolysis in the vicinity of electrodes , and increasing the magnetic field strength is limited by the cost , size and weight ( as well as technological limitations ) of electromagnets and the power available to feed them . stronger technical limitations apply to air-breathing mhd propulsion ( where ambient air is ionized ) that is still limited to theoretical concepts and early experiments . plasma propulsion engines using magnetohydrodynamics for space exploration have also been actively studied as such electromagnetic propulsion offers high thrust and high specific impulse at the same time , and the propellant would last much longer than rocket engine .
