the german city of cologne was founded in the 1st century as the roman colonia claudia ara agrippinensium . it was taken by the franks in the 5th century and became an important city of medieval germany , the seat of an archbishop and a prince-elector . as the free imperial city of cologne it was one of the centers of the hanseatic league in the early modern period . most of the city was destroyed in the bombing of cologne in world war ii , so it was of limited importance in post-war west germany . it had returned to its pre-war population by 1959 , by which time d√ºsseldorf was the political center of the state of north rhine-westphalia , and bonn was the ( provisional ) capital of the federal republic . in the late 20th century , cologne grew into a center of the sprawling rhine-ruhr metropolitan area , with some 12 million inhabitants , just over one million of whom live in cologne proper ( as of 2012 ) , making the city the fourth largest in germany ( after berlin , hamburg and munich ) .
