a time signal is a visible , audible , mechanical , or electronic signal used as a reference to determine the time of day . church bells or voices announcing hours of prayer gave way to automatically operated chimes on public clocks ; however , audible signals ( even signal guns ) have limited range . busy seaports used a visual signal , the dropping of a ball , to allow mariners to check the chronometers used for navigation . the advent of electrical telegraphs allowed widespread and precise distribution of time signals from central observatories . railways were among the first customers for time signals , which allowed synchronization of their operations over wide geographic areas . dedicated radio time signal stations transmit a signal that allows automatic synchronization of clocks , and commercial broadcasters still include time signals in their programming . today , gps navigation radio signals are used to precisely distribute time signals over much of the world . there are many commercially available radio clock available to accurately indicate the local time , both for business and residential use . computers often set their time from an time server . where this is not available , a locally connected gps receiver can precisely set the time using one of several software applications .
