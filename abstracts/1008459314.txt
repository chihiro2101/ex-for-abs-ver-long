to the offspring . most recombination is naturally occurring . during meiosis in eukaryotes , genetic recombination involves the pairing of homologous chromosomes . this may be followed by information transfer between the chromosomes . the information transfer may occur without physical exchange ( a section of genetic material is copied from one chromosome to another , without the donating chromosome being changed ) ( see sdsa pathway in figure ) ; or by the breaking and rejoining of dna strands , which forms new molecules of dna ( see dhj pathway in figure ) . recombination may also occur during mitosis in eukaryotes where it ordinarily involves the two sister chromosomes formed after chromosomal replication . in this case , new combinations of alleles are not produced since the sister chromosomes are usually identical . in meiosis and mitosis , recombination occurs between similar molecules of dna ( homologous sequences ) . in meiosis , non-sister homologous chromosomes pair with each other so that recombination characteristically occurs between non-sister homologues . in both meiotic and mitotic cells , recombination between homologous chromosomes is a common mechanism used in dna repair . gene conversion - the process during which homologous sequences are made identical also falls under genetic recombination . genetic recombination and recombinational dna repair also occurs in bacteria and archaea , which use asexual reproduction . recombination can be artificially induced in laboratory ( in vitro ) settings , producing recombinant dna for purposes including vaccine development . v ( d ) j recombination in organisms with an adaptive immune system is a type of site-specific genetic recombination that helps immune cells rapidly diversify to recognize and adapt to new pathogens .
