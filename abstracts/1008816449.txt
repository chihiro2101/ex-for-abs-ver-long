air raid precautions ( arp ) refers to a number of organisations and guidelines in the united kingdom dedicated to the protection of civilians from the danger of air raids . government consideration for air raid precautions increased in the 1920s and 30s , with the raid wardens ' service set up in 1937 to report on bombing incidents . every local council was responsible for organising arp wardens , messengers , ambulance drivers , rescue parties , and liaison with police and fire brigades . from 1 september 1939 , arp wardens enforced the '' blackout '' . heavy curtains and shutters were required on all private residences , commercial premises , and factories to prevent light escaping and so making them a possible marker for enemy bombers to locate their targets . with increased enemy bombing during the blitz , the arp services were central in reporting and dealing with bombing incidents . they managed the air raid sirens and ensured people were directed to shelters . women were involved in arp services through the women 's voluntary service . the auxiliary fire service was set up in 1938 to support existing local fire services , which were amalgamated into a national fire service in 1941 . from 1941 the arp officially changed its title to civil defence service to reflect the wider range of roles it then encompassed . during the war almost 7,000 civil defence workers were killed . in all some 1.5 million men and women served within the organisation during world war two . over 127,000 full-time personnel were involved at the height of the blitz but by the end of 1943 this had dropped to 70,000 . the civil defence service was stood down towards the end of the war in europe on 2 may 1945 . between 1949 and 1968 many of the duties of the civil defence service were resurrected through the civil defence corps .
