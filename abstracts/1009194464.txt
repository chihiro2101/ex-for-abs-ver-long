sir george-étienne cartier , 1st baronet , ( pronounced ; september 6 , 1814may 20 , 1873 ) was a canadian statesman and father of confederation . the english spelling of the name—george , instead of georges , the usual french spelling—is explained by him having been named in honour of king george iii . in the years leading up to confederation , cartier was a dominant figure in the politics of canada east as leader of the parti bleu . in 1838 he returned to montreal after a year in exile for his role in the lower canada rebellion . he officially entered politics in 1848 . during his long career he promoted the establishment of the civil code as the formal law of canada east , instead of sole use of common law as was present in canada west . he also promoted the introduction of primary education in the province . cartier had several reasons for supporting confederation , notably his fear of american expansion . he died in london , england , on may 20 , 1873 .
