freeganism is an ideology of limited participation in the conventional economy and minimal consumption of resources , particularly through recovering wasted goods like food . the word '' freegan '' is a portmanteau of '' free '' and '' vegan '' . while vegans avoid buying animal products as an act of protest against animal exploitation , freegans—at least in theory—avoid buying anything as an act of protest against the food system in general . freeganism is often presented as synonymous with '' dumpster diving '' for discarded food , although freegans are distinguished by their association with an anti-consumerism and anti-capitalism ideology and their engagement in a wider range of alternative living strategies , such as voluntary unemployment , squatting in abandoned buildings , and '' guerrilla gardening '' in unoccupied city parks .
