the man from snowy river '' is a poem by australian bush poet banjo paterson . it was first published in the bulletin , an australian news magazine , on 26 april 1890 , and was published by angus & robertson in october 1895 , with other poems by paterson , in the man from snowy river and other verses . the poem tells the story of a horseback pursuit to recapture the colt of a prizewinning racehorse that escaped from its paddock and is living with the brumby ( wild horses ) of the mountain ranges . eventually the brumbies descend a seemingly impassable steep slope , at which point the assembled riders give up the pursuit , except the young protagonist , who spurs his '' pony '' ( small horse ) down the '' terrible descent '' and catches the mob . two characters mentioned in the early part of the poem are featured in previous paterson poems ; '' clancy of the overflow '' and harrison from '' old pardon , son of reprieve '' .
