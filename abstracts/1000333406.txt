the coandă effect or is the tendency of a fluid jet to stay attached to a convex surface . it is named after romanian inventor henri coandă , who described it as '' the tendency of a jet of fluid emerging from an orifice to follow an adjacent flat or curved surface and to entrain fluid from the surroundings so that a region of lower pressure develops . '' david tritton , physical fluid dynamics , van nostrand reinhold , 1977 ( reprinted 1980 ) , section 22.7 , the coandă effect . coandă was the first to recognize the practical application of the phenomenon in aircraft design . '' the coanda effect is a phenomenon that was first observed in 1910 by a mathematician and engineer named henri coandă . he discovered that when air was ejected from a rectangular nozzle , it would attach itself to an inclined flat plate connected to the nozzle exit . emphasizing the need for a sharp angle between the nozzle and the flat plate , coandă then applied the principle to a series of deflecting surfaces , each at a sharp angle to the previous one , and succeeded in turning flows through angles as large as 180 . he stated that '' when a jet of fluid is passed over a curved surface , it bends to follow the surface , entraining large amounts of air as it does so , '' and this phenomenon has become known as the coandă effect . on some recent applications of the coanda effect caroline lubert international journal of acoustics and vibration , vol . 16 , no . 3 , 2011 effect .
