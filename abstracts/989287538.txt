a proscenium , is the metaphorical vertical plane of space in a theatre , usually surrounded on the top and sides by a physical proscenium arch ( whether or not truly '' arched '' ) and on the bottom by the stage floor itself , which serves as the frame into which the audience observes from a more or less unified angle the events taking place upon the stage during a theatrical performance . the concept of the fourth wall of the theatre stage space that faces the audience is essentially the same . it can be considered as a social construct which divides the actors and their stage-world from the audience which has come to witness it . but since the curtain usually comes down just behind the proscenium arch , it has a physical reality when the curtain is down , hiding the stage from view . the same plane also includes the drop , in traditional theatres of modern times , from the stage level to the '' stalls '' level of the audience , which was the original meaning of the proscaenium in roman theatres , where this mini-facade was given more architectural emphasis than is the case in modern theatres . a proscenium stage is structurally different from a thrust stage or an arena stage , as explained below .
