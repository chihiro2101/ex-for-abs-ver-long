dawn summers is a fictional character created by joss whedon and introduced by marti noxon and david fury on the television series buffy the vampire slayer , portrayed by michelle trachtenberg . she made her debut in the premiere episode of the show 's fifth season and subsequently appeared in every episode of its remaining three seasons . within the series , dawn is the little sister of main character buffy summers ( sarah michelle gellar ) , a girl chosen by fate to be a vampire slayer . whedon introduced dawn to the series because he wanted to introduce a character with whom buffy could have an intensely emotional non-romantic relationship . after years of foreshadowing , dawn was introduced at the start of the fifth season as part of a large in-story retcon : characters accepted dawn 's presence as if she had always been there , and as if buffy always had a sister , with only the audience aware that this was not the case . as the series went on , the significance of dawn 's arrival is revealed to the series 's other characters , and they come to understand that she has not always been buffy 's sister , or indeed a sentient being ; dawn had originally been the mystical '' key '' to unlocking dimensions and was made into buffy 's sister so the slayer would protect her . dawn is , however , a real girl , buffy 's biological sister , and has real memories of her fictional childhood . she struggles in a very human way when she discovers the truth about her origins and later endures problems with self-harm and kleptomania . the show 's sixth and seventh seasons , as well as its canonical comic book continuation , follow dawn 's journey toward adulthood . dawn was included in tv guide list of most loathed tv characters . similarly , entertainment weekly named her one of the '' 21 most annoying tv characters ever '' .
