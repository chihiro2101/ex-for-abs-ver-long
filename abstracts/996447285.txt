the colonial militias in canada were made up of various militias prior to confederation in 1867 . during the period of new france and acadia , newfoundland , and nova scotia ( 1605-1763 ) , these militias were made up of canadiens , first nations , british and acadians . traditionally , the canadian militia was the name used for the local sedentary militia regiments throughout the canadas . however , the term '' militia '' was also used to refer to the canadian regular professional land forces , beginning with the passing of the militia act of 1855 . passed by the legislative assembly of the province of canada , the act created the active militia , later referred to as the permanent active militia . after pam 's formation , the remaining sedentary colonial militia regiments were collectively referred to as the non-permanent active militia ( npam ) . the terms pam and npam continued to be used in canada until 1940 , when the canadian militias was reorganized into the canadian army . the term militia is still used to refer to the canadian army 's part-time primary reserve .
