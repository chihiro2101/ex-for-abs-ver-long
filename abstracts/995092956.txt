a camera lens ( also known as photographic lens or photographic objective ) is an optics lens or assembly of lenses used in conjunction with a camera body and mechanism to make images of objects either on photographic film or on other media capable of storing an image chemically or electronically . there is no major difference in principle between a lens used for a still camera , a video camera , a telescope , a microscope , or other apparatus , but the details of design and construction are different . a lens might be permanently fixed to a camera , or it might be interchangeable with lenses of different focal lengths , apertures , and other properties . while in principle a simple lens will suffice , in practice a compound lens made up of a number of optical lens ( optics ) is required to correct ( as much as possible ) the many optical aberrations that arise . some aberrations will be present in any lens system . it is the job of the lens designer to balance these and produce a design that is suitable for photographic use and possibly mass production .
