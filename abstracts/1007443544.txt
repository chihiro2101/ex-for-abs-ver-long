the race to the bottom is a socioeconomics phrase to describe government deregulation of the business environment , or reduction in tax rates , in order to attract or retain economic activity in their jurisdictions . while this phenomenon can happen between countries as a result of globalization and free trade , it also can occur within individual countries between their sub-jurisdictions ( states , localities , cities ) . it may occur when competition increases between geographic areas over a particular sector of trade and production . the effect and intent of these actions is to lower labor rates , cost of business , or other factors ( pensions , environmental protection and other externalities ) over which governments can exert control . this deregulation lowers the cost of production for businesses . countries/localities with higher labor , environmental standards , or taxes can lose business to countries/localities with less regulation , which in turn makes them want to lower regulations in order to keep firms ’ production in their jurisdiction , hence driving the race to the lowest regulatory standards . “ the politics of multinational corporations . ” international political economy , by thomas oatley , 6th ed . , routledge , taylor '' francis group , 2019 , pp . 183–207 .
