notwithstanding the economic importance of livestock in the region , the sector is facing major challenges . first , many of the traditional livestock grazing lands are turned into regular farmlands . and , consequently , the regular seasonal movements of pastoralists for alternate pasture lands are severely curtailed . this adversely affected livestock population and production quality . without a regional rural land management policy and demarcation between grazing and farmlands , the economic roles of the livestock is in jeopardy . second , available skilled livestock health professionals are very limited . the number of skilled staff in the region is 17 . this number is too small to meet regional demand . during livestock mass treatments and vaccinations , additional skilled staff such community animal health workers ( cahws ) are hired from outside . third , livestock health facilities in the region are also very limited . the only one existing in the region is in borama . the sector office in borama is both an administration offices , and regional drug store . two other small vet facilities exist in dilla and quljeed districts and used as offices and drug stores . fourth , the institutional capacity of the ministry of livestock in the region is weak . there are no administration offices , livestock health facilities , and adequate skilled professional in baki , lughaya and zeila districts where livestock population in the region is mostly available . finally , the regional ministry is severely constrained by the absence of regular budget allocations . lack of adequate budget allocations hinders operational activities of the sector .
