modern orthodox judaism ( also modern orthodox or modern orthodoxy ) is a movement within orthodox judaism that attempts to synthesize jewish values and the halakha with the secular , modern world . modern orthodoxy draws on several teachings and philosophies , and thus assumes various forms . in the united states , and generally in the western world , centrist orthodoxy underpinned by the philosophy of torah umadda ( '' torah and scientific knowledge '' ) is prevalent . in israel , modern orthodoxy is dominated by religious zionism ; however , although not identical , these movements share many of the same values and many of the same adherents . charles s . liebman , modern orthodoxy in israel judaism , fall , 1998
