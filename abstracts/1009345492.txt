crowd psychology , also known as mob psychology , is a branch of social psychology . social psychologists have developed several theories for explaining the ways in which the psychology of a crowd differs from and interacts with that of the individuals within it . major theorists in crowd psychology include gustave le bon , gabriel tarde , sigmund freud , and steve reicher . this field relates to the behaviors and thought processes of both the individual crowd members and the crowd as an entity . crowd behavior is heavily influenced by the deindividuation and the impression of universality of behavior , both of which increase with crowd size .
