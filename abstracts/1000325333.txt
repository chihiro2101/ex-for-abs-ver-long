the rete algorithm , , rarely , is a pattern matching algorithm for implementing rule-based systems . the algorithm was developed to efficiently apply many rules or patterns to many objects , or facts , in a knowledge base . it is used to determine which of the system 's rules should fire based on its data store , its facts . the rete algorithm was designed by charles forgy of carnegie mellon university , first published in a working paper in 1974 , and later elaborated in his 1979 ph.d . thesis and a 1982 paper . charles forgy : rete : a fast algorithm for the many pattern/many object pattern match problem . in : artificial intelligence , vol . 19 , pp . 17â€“37 , 1982 .
