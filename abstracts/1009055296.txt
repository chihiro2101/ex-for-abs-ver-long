a honky-tonk ( also called honkatonk , honkey-tonk , or tonk ) is both a bar that provides country music for the entertainment of its patrons and the style of music played in such establishments . it can also refer to the type of piano ( tack piano ) used to play such music . bars of this kind are common in the south and southwest united states . many eminent country music artists , such as jimmie rodgers , loretta lynn , patsy cline , ernest tubb , johnny horton , and merle haggard , began their careers as amateur musicians in honky-tonks . the modern-day honky-tonk atmosphere has continued with the likes of dwight yoakam , turnpike troubadours , and mike and the moonpies . the origin of the term honky-tonk is disputed , originally referring to bawdy variety shows in areas of the old west ( oklahoma , the indian territory and texas ) and to the actual theaters showing them . the first music genre to be commonly known as honky-tonk was a style of piano playing related to ragtime but emphasizing rhythm more than melody or harmony ; the style evolved in response to an environment in which pianos were often poorly cared for , tending to be out of tune and having some nonfunctioning keys . this honky-tonk music was an important influence on the boogie-woogie piano style . before world war ii , the music industry began to refer to hillbilly music being played from texas and oklahoma to the west coast as '' honky-tonk '' music . in the 1950s , honky-tonk entered its golden age , with the popularity of webb pierce , hank locklin , lefty frizzell , ray price , faron young , george jones , and hank williams .
