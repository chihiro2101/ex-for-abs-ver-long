jephthah ( pronounced ; yiftāḥ ) , appears in the book of judges as a judge who presided over israel for a period of six years . according to judges , he lived in gilead . his father 's name is also given as gilead , and , as his mother is described as a prostitute , this may indicate that his father might have been any of the men of that area . jephthah led the israelites in battle against ammon and , in exchange for defeating the ammonites , made a vow to sacrifice whatever would come out of the door of his house first . when his daughter was the first to come out of the house , he immediately regretted the vow , which would require him to sacrifice his daughter to god . jephthah then carried out his vow . traditionally , jephthah is listed among major judges because of the length of the biblical narrative referring to him , but his story also shares features with those of the minor judges , such as his short tenure—only six years—in office .
