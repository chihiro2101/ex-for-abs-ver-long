ambidexterity is the ability to use both the right and left hand equally well . when referring to objects , the term indicates that the object is equally suitable for right-handed and left-handed people . when referring to humans , it indicates that a person has no handedness . only about one percent of people are naturally ambidextrous , which equals out to about 70,000,000 people out of the population of 7 billion . in modern times , it is common to find some people considered ambidextrous who were originally left-handed and who learned to be ambidextrous , either deliberately or as a result of training in schools or in jobs where right-handed habits are often emphasized or required . since many everyday devices ( such as can openers and scissors ) are asymmetrical and designed for right-handed people , many left-handers learn to use them right-handedly due to the rarity or lack of left-handed models . thus , left-handed people are more likely to develop motor skills in their non-dominant hand than right-handed people .
