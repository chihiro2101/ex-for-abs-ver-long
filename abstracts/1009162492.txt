sound can be recorded and stored and played using either digital or analog techniques . both techniques introduce errors and distortions in the sound , and these methods can be systematically compared . musicians and listeners have argued over the superiority of digital versus analog sound recordings . arguments for analog systems include the absence of fundamental error mechanisms which are present in digital audio systems , including aliasing and quantization noise . advocates of digital point to the high levels of performance possible with digital audio , including excellent linearity in the audible band and low levels of noise and distortion . two prominent differences in performance between the two methods are the bandwidth and the signal-to-noise ratio ( s/n ratio ) . the bandwidth of the digital system is determined , according to the nyquist frequency , by the sample rate used . the bandwidth of an analog system is dependent on the physical capabilities of the analog circuits . the s/n ratio of a digital system may be limited by the bit depth of the digitization process , but the electronic implementation of conversion circuits introduces additional noise . in an analog system , other natural analog noise sources exist , such as flicker noise and imperfections in the recording medium . other performance differences are specific to the systems under comparison , such as the ability for more transparent digital filter in digital systems and the distortion ( music ) and wow ( recording ) of analog systems .
