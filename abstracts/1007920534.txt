baking powder is a dry chemical leavening agent , a mixture of a carbonate or bicarbonate and a weak acid . the base and acid are prevented from reacting prematurely by the inclusion of a buffer such as cornstarch . baking powder is used to increase the volume and lighten the texture of baked goods . it works by releasing carbon dioxide gas into a batter or dough through an acidâ€“base reaction , causing bubbles in the wet mixture to expand and thus leavening the mixture . the first single-acting baking powder was developed by food manufacturer alfred bird in england in 1843 . the first double-acting baking powder was developed by eben norton horsford in the united states of america in the 1860s . baking powder is used instead of yeast for end-products where fermentation flavors would be undesirable , where the batter lacks the elastic structure to hold gas bubbles for more than a few minutes , and to speed the production of baked goods . because carbon dioxide is released at a faster rate through the acid-base reaction than through fermentation , breads made by chemical leavening are called quick breads . the introduction of baking powder was revolutionary in minimizing the time and labor required to make breadstuffs . it led to the creation of new types of cakes , cookies , biscuits , and other baked goods .
