the battle of neresheim ( 11 august 1796 ) saw a victory of republican french army under jean victor marie moreau over the army of the habsburg monarchy of archduke charles , duke of teschen . pursued by moreau 's army of rhin-et-moselle , charles launched an attack against the french . while the austrian left wing saw some success , the battle degenerated into a stalemate and the archduke withdrew further into the electorate of bavaria . neresheim is located in the state of baden-w√ºrttemberg in germany a distance of northeast of ulm . the action took place during the war of the first coalition , part of a larger conflict called the french revolutionary wars . in the rhine campaign of 1796 , two french armies successfully breached the rhine river to invade germany , moreau 's army in the south and jean-baptiste jourdan 's army of sambre-et-meuse in the north . the french armies operated independently while charles commanded both maximilian anton karl , count baillet de latour 's army of the upper rhine in the south and wilhelm von wartensleben 's army of the lower rhine in the north . charles hoped to concentrate superior strength against one of the two french armies . to keep his enemies separated , the archduke wished to lure moreau south of the danube river by crossing to the south bank . to allow his columns to cross the river safely , charles attacked the french , hoping to push them back . though he failed to defeat the french , the battle gave the archduke enough space to get his troops over the danube without interference . though he had a chance to join his army to jourdan 's in the north , moreau soon crossed to the south bank in pursuit .
