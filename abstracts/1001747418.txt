the hall–héroult process is the major industrial process for aluminium smelting . it involves dissolving aluminium oxide ( obtained most often from bauxite , aluminium 's chief ore , through the bayer process ) in molten cryolite , and electrolysis the molten salt bath , typically in a purpose-built cell . the hall–héroult process applied at industrial scale happens at 940–980 & nbsp ; °c and produces 99.5–99.8 % pure aluminium . recycled aluminum requires no electrolysis , thus it does not end up in this process . this process contributes to climate change through the emission of carbon dioxide in the electrolytic reaction .
