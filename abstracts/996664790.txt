the boll weevil ( anthonomus grandis ) is a beetle that feeds on cotton buds and flowers . thought to be native to central mexico , it migrated into the united states from mexico in the late 19th century and had infested all u.s . cotton-growing areas by the 1920s , devastating the industry and the people working in the american south . during the late 20th century , it became a serious pest in south america as well . since 1978 , the boll weevil eradication program in the u.s . allowed full-scale cultivation to resume in many regions .
