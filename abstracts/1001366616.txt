the copyright law of the european union is the copyright law applicable within the european union . copyright law is largely harmonized in the union , although country to country differences exist . the body of law was implemented in the eu through a number of directives , which the member states need to enact into their national law . the main copyright directives are the copyright term directive , the information society directive and the directive on copyright in the digital single market . copyright in the union is furthermore dependent on international conventions to which the european union is a member ( such as the trips agreement and conventions to which all member states are parties ( such as the berne convention ) ) .
