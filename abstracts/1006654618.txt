the word decadence , which at first meant simply '' decline '' in an abstract sense , is now most often used to refer to a perceived decay in standards , morals , dignity , religion , honor , discipline , or skill at governing among the members of the elite of a very large social structure , such as an empire or nation state . by extension , it may refer to a decline in art , literature , science , technology , and work ethics , or ( very loosely ) to libertinism behavior . usage of the term sometimes implies moral censure , or an acceptance of the idea , met with throughout the world since ancient times , that such declines are objectively observable and that they inevitably precede the destruction of the society in question ; for this reason , modern historians use it with caution . the word originated in medieval latin ( dēcadentia ) , appeared in 16th-century french , and entered english soon afterwards . it bore the neutral meaning of decay , decrease , or decline until the late 19th century , when the influence of new theories of social degeneration contributed to its modern meaning . in literature , the decadent movement—late nineteenth century fin de siècle writers who were associated with symbolism or the aesthetic movement—was first given its name by hostile critics . later it was triumphantly adopted by some of the writers themselves . the decadents praised artifice over nature and sophistication over simplicity , defying contemporary discourses of decline by embracing subjects and styles that their critics considered morbid and over-refined . some of these writers were influenced by the tradition of the gothic novel and by the poetry and fiction of edgar allan poe .
