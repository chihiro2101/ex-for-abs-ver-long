investigations concerning kupffer cells are hampered because in humans , kupffer cells are only accessible for immunohistochemical analysis from biopsies or autopsies . from rats and mice , they are difficult to isolate , and after purification , only approximately 5 & nbsp ; million cells can be obtained from one mouse . macrophages can express paracrine functions within organs that are specific to the function of that organ . in the testis , for example , macrophages have been shown to be able to interact with leydig cells by secreting 25-hydroxycholesterol , an oxysterol that can be converted to testosterone by neighbouring leydig cells . also , testicular macrophages may participate in creating an immune privileged environment in the testis , and in mediating infertility during inflammation of the testis . cardiac resident macrophages participate in electrical conduction via gap junction communication with cardiac myocytes . macrophages can be classified on basis of the fundamental function and activation . according to this grouping there are macrophage polarization m1 macrophages , wound-healing macrophages ( also known as macrophage polarization m2 macrophages ) , and regulatory macrophages ( mregs ) .
