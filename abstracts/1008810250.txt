an optical mouse is a computer mouse which uses a light source , typically a light-emitting diode ( led ) , and a light detector , such as an array of photodiodes , to detect movement relative to a surface . variations of the optical mouse have largely replaced the older mechanical mouse design , which uses moving parts to sense motion . the earliest optical mice detected movement on pre-printed mousepad surfaces . modern optical mice work on most opaque diffuse reflection surfaces like paper , but most of them do not work properly on specular reflection surfaces like polished stone or transparent surfaces like glass . optical mice that use dark field microscopy can function reliably even on such surfaces .
