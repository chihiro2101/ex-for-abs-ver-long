blindsight is the ability of people who are cortically blind due to lesions in their striate cortex , also known as the primary visual cortex or v1 , to respond to visual stimuli that they do not consciously see . the majority of studies on blindsight are conducted on patients who have the conscious blindness on only one side of their visual field . following the destruction of the striate cortex , patients are asked to detect , localize , and discriminate amongst visual stimuli that are presented to their blind side , often in a forced-response or guessing situation , even though they do not consciously recognize the visual stimulus . research shows that blind patients achieve a higher accuracy than would be expected from chance alone . type 1 blindsight is the term given to this ability to guess—at levels significantly above chance—aspects of a visual stimulus ( such as location or type of movement ) without any conscious awareness of any stimuli . type 2 blindsight occurs when patients claim to have a feeling that there has been a change within their blind area—e.g . movement—but that it was not a visual percept . blindsight challenges the common belief that perceptions must enter consciousness to affect our behavior ; showing that our behavior can be guided by sensory information of which we have no conscious awareness . it may be thought of as a converse of the form of anosognosia known as anton–babinski syndrome , in which there is full cortical blindness along with the confabulation of visual experience .
