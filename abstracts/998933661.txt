intentionality is the power of minds to be about something : to represent or to stand for things , properties and states of affairs . intentionality is primarily ascribed to mental states , like perceptions , beliefs or desires , which is why it has been regarded as the characteristic mark of the mental by many philosophers . a central issue for theories of intentionality has been the problem of intentional inexistence : to determine the ontological status of the entities which are the objects of intentional states . the earliest theory of intentionality is associated with anselm of canterbury 's ontological argument for the existence of god , and with his tenets distinguishing between objects that exist in the understanding and objects that exist in reality . the idea fell out of discussion with the end of the medieval scholastic period , but in recent times was resurrected by empirical psychologist franz brentano and later adopted by contemporary phenomenology ( philosophy ) edmund husserl . today , intentionality is a live concern among philosophers of mind and language . a common dispute is between naturalism about intentionality , the view that intentional properties are reducible to natural properties as studied by the natural sciences , and the phenomenal intentionality theory , the view that intentionality is grounded in consciousness .
