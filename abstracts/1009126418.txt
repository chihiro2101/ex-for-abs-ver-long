syntactic ambiguity , also called structural ambiguity , amphiboly or amphibology , is a situation where a sentence may be interpreted in more than one way due to ambiguous syntax . syntactic ambiguity arises not from the range of polysemy , but from the relationship between the words and clauses of a sentence , and the sentence structure underlying the word order therein . in other words , a sentence is syntactically ambiguous when a reader or listener can reasonably interpret one sentence as having more than one possible structure . in legal disputes , courts may be asked to interpret the meaning of syntactic ambiguities in statutes or contracts . in some instances , arguments asserting highly unlikely interpretations have been deemed frivolous . a set of possible parse trees for an ambiguous sentence is called a parse forest . billot , sylvie , and bernard lang .
