the red arrows , officially known as the royal air force aerobatic team , is the aerobatics display team of the royal air force based at raf scampton . the team was formed in late 1964 as an all-raf team , replacing a number of unofficial teams that had been sponsored by raf commands . the red arrows have a prominent place in british popular culture , with their aerobatic displays a fixture of british summer events . the badge of the red arrows shows the aircraft in their trademark diamond nine formation , with the motto Ã©clat , a french word meaning '' brilliance '' or '' excellence '' . initially , they were equipped with seven folland gnat trainers inherited from the raf yellowjacks display team . this aircraft was chosen because it was less expensive to operate than front-line fighters . in their first season , they flew at 65 shows across europe . in 1966 , the team was increased to nine members , enabling them to develop their diamond nine formation . in late 1979 , they switched to the bae hawk trainer . the red arrows have performed over 4,800 displays in 57 countries worldwide .
