electrical elements are conceptual abstractions representing idealized electrical components , such as resistors , capacitors , and inductors , used in the analysis of electrical networks . all electrical networks can be analyzed as multiple electrical elements interconnected by wires . where the elements roughly correspond to real components , the representation can be in the form of a schematic diagram or circuit diagram . this is called a lumped-element model . in other cases , infinitesimal elements are used to model the network , in a distributed-element model . these ideal electrical elements represent real , physical electronic component but they do not exist physically and they are assumed to have ideal properties , while actual electrical components have less than ideal properties , a degree of uncertainty in their values and some degree of nonlinearity . to model the nonideal behavior of a real circuit component may require a combination of multiple ideal electrical elements in order to approximate its function . for example , an inductor circuit element is assumed to have inductance but no resistance or capacitance , while a real inductor , a coil of wire , has some resistance in addition to its inductance . this may be modeled by an ideal inductance element in series with a resistance . circuit analysis using electric elements is useful for understanding many practical electrical networks using components . by analyzing the way a network is affected by its individual elements it is possible to estimate how a real network will behave .
