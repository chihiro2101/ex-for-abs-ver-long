cytokines are a broad and loose category of small proteins ( ~5–20 kda ) important in cell signaling . cytokines are peptides and can not cross the lipid bilayer of cells to enter the cytoplasm . cytokines have been shown to be involved in autocrine , paracrine and endocrine signaling as immunomodulation . their definite distinction from hormones is still part of ongoing research . cytokines include chemokines , interferons , interleukins , lymphokines , and tumour necrosis factors , but generally not hormones or growth factors ( despite some overlap in the terminology ) . cytokines are produced by a broad range of cells , including immune cells like macrophages , b cell , t cell and mast cells , as well as endothelium , fibroblasts , and various stromal cells ; a given cytokine may be produced by more than one type of cell . they act through cell surface receptors and are especially important in the immune system ; cytokines modulate the balance between humoral and cell-based immune responses , and they regulate the maturation , growth , and responsiveness of particular cell populations . some cytokines enhance or inhibit the action of other cytokines in complex ways . they are different from hormones , which are also important cell signaling molecules . hormones circulate in higher concentrations , and tend to be made by specific kinds of cells . cytokines are important in health and disease , specifically in host immune responses to infection , inflammation , trauma , sepsis , cancer , and reproduction . the word comes from greek : cyto , from greek '' κύτος '' kytos '' cavity , cell '' + kines , from greek '' κίνησις '' kinēsis '' movement '' .
