thumb shortstop , abbreviated ss , is the baseball positions between second and third base , which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions . historically the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order . today shortstops are often able to hit well and many are placed at the top of the lineup . in the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays , the shortstop is assigned the number 6 . more hit balls go to the shortstop than to any other position , as there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters , and most hitters have a tendency to pull hitter slightly . like a second baseman , a shortstop must be agile , for example when performing a 4-6-3 double play . also , like a third baseman , the shortstop fields balls hit to the left side of the infield , where a strong arm is needed to throw out a batter-runner before they reach the safety of first base .
