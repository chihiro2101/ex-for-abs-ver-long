the battle of dresden ( 26â€“27 august 1813 ) was a major engagement of the napoleonic wars . the battle took place around the city of dresden in modern-day germany . with the recent addition of austria , the sixth coalition felt emboldened in their quest to expel the french from central europe . despite being heavily outnumbered , french forces under napoleon scored a victory against the army of bohemia led by field marshal karl von schwarzenberg . however , napoleon 's victory did not lead to the collapse of the coalition , and the weather and the uncommitted russian reserves who formed an effective rear-guard precluded a major pursuit . three days after the battle , the allies surrounded and destroyed a french corps advancing into their line of withdrawal at the battle of kulm .
