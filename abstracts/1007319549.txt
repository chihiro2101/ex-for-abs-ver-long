ø ( or minuscule : ø ) is a vowel and a letter used in the danish , norwegian , faroese , and southern sami languages . it is mostly used as a representation of mid front rounded vowels , such as and , except for southern sami where it is used as an diphthong . the name of this letter is the same as the sound it represents ( see usage ) . though not its native name , among english-speaking typographers the symbol may be called a '' slashed o '' pullum , geoffrey k . , & william a . ladusaw . 1996 . phonetic symbol guide , 2nd ed . chicago : university of chicago press , p . 136 . or '' o with stroke '' . although these names suggest it is a ligature or a diacritical variant of the letter o , it is considered a separate letter in norwegian and danish , and it is alphabetized after '' z '' —thus z , æ , ø , and å . in other languages that do not have the letter as part of the regular alphabet , or in limited character sets such as ascii , ø may correctly be replaced with the digraph '' oe '' , although in practice it is often replaced with just an '' o '' , e.g . in email addresses . it is equivalent to the letter ö used in swedish ( and a number of other languages ) , and may also be replaced with ö , as was often the case with older typewriters in denmark and norway . ø ( lower case ) is also used in the international phonetic alphabet to represent a close-mid front rounded vowel .
