footrot flats is a comic strip by new zealand cartoonist murray ball . it ran from 1976 to 1994 in newspapers , though unpublished strips continued to appear in book form until 2000 . altogether there are 27 numbered books ( collecting the newspaper strips , with additional material ) , a further 8 books collecting the sunday newspaper strips , and 5 smaller 'pocket ' books of original material , plus various related publications . there was also a stage musical , an animated feature film called footrot flats : the dog 's tale , and even a theme park in auckland , new zealand . the strip reached its peak of popularity in the mid-1980s , with the books selling millions of copies in australasia . the comic 's protagonist is a border collie sheepdog , called '' dog '' , owned by wal footrot , who runs a sheep and cattle farm called footrot flats near the fictional rural town of raupo in new zealand . the comic depicts the trials and tribulations of wal , the dog and other characters , human and animal , that come into their lives . the dog 's thoughts are voiced in thought bubbles , though he is clearly '' just a dog '' , unlike the heavily anthropomorphised creatures of some other comics or animation . the humour draws on the foibles of the characters , which many farmers found easy to recognise around them . there was much '' humour in adversity '' , making fun of the daily struggle that permeates farming life . the depictions of the animals are quite realistic and detailed , with a dose of comic anthropomorphism superimposed without spoiling the farming realism .
