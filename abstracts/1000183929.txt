the matthew bible , also known as matthew 's version , was first published in 1537 by john rogers , under the pseudonym '' thomas matthew '' . it combined the new testament of william tyndale , and as much of the old testament as he had been able to translate before being captured and put to death . myles coverdale 's translations , chiefly from german and latin sources , completed the old testament and biblical apocrypha , except for the prayer of manasseh , which was rogers ' . it is thus a vital link in the main sequence of english bible translations .
