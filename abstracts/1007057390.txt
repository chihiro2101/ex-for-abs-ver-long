honour ( british english ) or honor ( american english ; see spelling differences ) is the idea of a bond between an individual and a society as a quality of a person that is both of social teaching and of personal ethos , that manifests itself as a code of conduct , and has various elements such as valour , chivalry , honesty , and compassion . it is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or institution such as a family , school , regiment or nation . accordingly , individuals ( or institutions ) are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific honour code , and the moral code of the society at large . samuel johnson , in his a dictionary of the english language ( 1755 ) , defined honour as having several senses , the first of which was '' nobility of soul , magnanimity , and a scorn of meanness '' . this sort of honour derives from the perceived virtuous conduct and personal integrity of the person endowed with it . on the other hand , johnson also defined honour in relationship to '' reputation '' and '' fame '' ; to '' privileges of rank or birth '' , and as '' respect '' of the kind which '' places an individual socially and determines his right to precedence '' . this sort of honour is often not so much a function of moral or ethical excellence , as it is a consequence of power . finally , with respect to sexuality , honour has traditionally been associated with ( or identical to ) '' chastity '' or '' virginity '' , or in case of married men and women , '' fidelity '' . some have argued that honour should be seen more as a rhetoric , or set of possible actions , than as a code .
