gene expression is the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product that enables it to produce protein as the end product . these products are often proteins , but in non-protein-coding genes such as transfer rna or small nuclear rna genes , the product is a functional rna . gene expression is summarized in the central dogma of molecular biology first formulated by francis crick in 1958 , further developed in his 1970 article , and expanded by the subsequent discoveries of reverse transcription and rna replication . the process of gene expression is used by all known life—eukaryotes ( including multicellular organisms ) , prokaryotes ( bacteria and archaea ) , and utilized by viruses—to generate the macromolecule machinery for life . in genetics , gene expression is the most fundamental level at which the genotype gives rise to the phenotype , i.e . observable trait . the genetic information stored in dna represents the genotype , whereas the phenotype results from the '' interpretation '' of that information . such phenotypes are often expressed by the synthesis of proteins that control the organism 's structure and development , or that act as enzymes catalyzing specific metabolic pathways . all steps in the gene expression process may be modulated ( regulated ) , including the transcription , rna splicing , translation , and post-translational modification of a protein . gene regulation gives control over the timing , location , and amount of a given gene product ( protein or ncrna ) present in a cell and can have a profound effect on the cellular structure and function . regulation of gene expression is the basis for cellular differentiation , development , morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism . gene regulation may therefore serve as a substrate for evolutionary change .
