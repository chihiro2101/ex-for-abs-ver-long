the business cycle , also known as the economic cycle or trade cycle , are the fluctuations of gross domestic product ( gdp ) around its long-term growth trend . the length of a business cycle is the period of time containing a single boom and contraction in sequence . these fluctuations typically involve shifts over time between periods of relatively rapid economic growth ( expansions or booms ) and periods of relative stagnation or decline ( contractions or recessions ) . business cycles are usually measured by considering the growth rate of real gross domestic product . despite the often-applied term cycles , these fluctuations in economic activity do not exhibit uniform or predictable periodicity . the common or popular usage boom-and-bust cycle refers to fluctuations in which the expansion is rapid and the contraction severe . the current view of mainstream economics is that business cycles are essentially the summation of purely random shocks to the economy and thus are not , in fact , cycles , despite appearing to be so . however , certain heterodox schools propose alternative theories suggesting that cycles do in fact exist due to endogenous causes .
