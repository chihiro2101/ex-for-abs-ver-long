an html editor is a program for editing html , the markup of a web page . although the html markup in a web page can be controlled with any text editor , specialized html editors can offer convenience and added functionality . for example , many html editors handle not only html , but also related technologies such as css , xml and javascript or ecmascript . in some cases they also manage communication with remote web servers via ftp and webdav , and version control systems such as subversion or git . many word processing , graphic design and page layout programs that are not dedicated to web design , such as microsoft word or quark xpress , also have the ability to function as html editors .
