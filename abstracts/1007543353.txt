the battle of wattignies ( 15–16 october 1793 ) saw a republican french army commanded by jean-baptiste jourdan attack a coalition army directed by prince josias of saxe-coburg-saalfeld . after two days of combat jourdan 's troops compelled the habsburg covering force led by françois sébastien charles joseph de croix , count of clerfayt to withdraw . the war of the first coalition victory allowed the french to raise the siege of maubeuge . at a time when failed generals were often executed or imprisoned , jourdan had to endure interference from lazare carnot from the committee of public safety . the village , renamed wattignies-la-victoire in honor of the important success , is located southeast of maubeuge . coburg 's main army encircled 25,000 french soldiers in maubeuge while about 22,000 austrians under clerfayt were formed in a semi-circle , covering the southern approaches to the fortress . on the first day , 45,000 french soldiers mounted a clumsy attack which was easily repulsed , except near the village of wattignies . on the second day , jourdan concentrated half his army at wattignies and after a tough fight , forced coburg to concede defeat . though the coalition army was better trained than the french , its units were spread out too thinly and the different nationalities failed to cooperate . soon the coalition army went into winter quarters , finishing a campaign that started with great promise and ended in disappointment . carnot rewrote history so that he and the political representatives got most of the credit for the triumph ; jourdan was dismissed in january 1794 .
