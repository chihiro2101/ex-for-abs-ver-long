saint philomena was a young consecrated virgin whose remains were discovered on may 24â€“25 , 1802 , in the catacomb of priscilla . three tiles enclosing the tomb bore an inscription , pax tecum filumena ( i.e . '' peace be unto you , philomena '' ) , that was taken to indicate that her name ( in the latin of the inscription ) was filumena , the english form of which is philomena . philomena is the patron saint of infants , babies , and youth . the remains were moved to mugnano del cardinale in 1805 . there , they became the focus of widespread devotion ; several miracles were credited to philomena 's intercession , including the healing of pauline jaricot in 1835 , which received wide publicity . john vianney attributed to her intercession the extraordinary cures that others attributed to himself . from 1837 to 1961 , celebration of her liturgy feast was approved for some places , but was never included in the general roman calendar for universal use . the 1920 typical edition of the roman missal included a mention of her , under august 11 , in the section headed missae pro aliquibus locis ( '' masses for some places '' ) , with an indication that the mass to be used in those places was one from the common of a virgin martyr , without any collect proper to the saint . 1920 typical edition of the roman missal , with feasts updated to the late 1920s , p . 214 : '' 11 august . st philomena . virgin and martyr . mass : loquebar from the common of virgins , 1 .
