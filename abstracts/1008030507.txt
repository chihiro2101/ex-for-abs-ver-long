pierce brothers westwood village memorial park & mortuary is a cemetery and mortuary located in the westwood village area of los angeles . it is located at 1218 glendon avenue in westwood , with an entrance from glendon avenue . the cemetery was established as sunset cemetery in 1905 , but had been used for burials since the 1880s . in 1926 the name was officially changed to westwood memorial park and was later changed again to pierce brothers westwood village memorial park & mortuary . although it is the resting place of some of the show business 's greatest names , it also contains the graves of many uncelebrated people . for example , when marilyn monroe died in 1962 , joe dimaggio , responsible for monroe 's arrangements , chose westwood not because of its celebrities but because it was the resting place of her mother 's friend , grace goddard , and goddard 's aunt , ana lower , both of whom had cared for monroe as a child . the studio for southern california history . retrieved february 21 , 2009 .
