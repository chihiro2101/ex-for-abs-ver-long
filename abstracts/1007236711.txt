a danish pastry , sometimes shortened to just danish ( especially in american english ) , is a multilayered , laminated sweet pastry in the viennoiserie tradition . the concept was brought to denmark by austrian bakers , and has since developed into a danish specialty . like other viennoiserie pastries , such as croissants , it is a variant of puff pastry made of laminated yeast-leavened dough that creates a layered texture . danish pastries were brought with immigrants to the united states , where they are often topped with a fruit or cream cheese filling , and are now popular around the world .
