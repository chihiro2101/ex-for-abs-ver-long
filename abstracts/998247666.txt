a united nations general assembly resolution is a decision or declaration voted on by all member states of the united nations in the general assembly . general assembly resolutions usually require a simple majority ( 50 percent of all votes plus one ) to pass . however , if the general assembly determines that the issue is an '' important question '' by a simple majority vote , then a two-thirds majority is required ; '' important questions '' are those that deal significantly with the maintenance of international peace and security , admission of new members to the united nations , suspension of the rights and privileges of membership , the expulsion of members , operation of the trusteeship system , or budgetary questions . although general assembly resolutions are generally non-binding towards member states , internal resolutions may be binding on the operation of the general assembly itself , for example with regard to budgetary and procedural matters .
