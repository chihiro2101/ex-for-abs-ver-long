a ski resort is a resort developed for skiing , snowboarding , and other winter sports . in europe , most ski resorts are towns or villages in or adjacent to a ski area â€“ a mountainous area with pistes ( ski trails ) and a ski lift system . in north america , it is more common for ski areas to exist well away from towns , so ski resorts usually are destination resorts , often purpose-built and self-contained , where skiing is the main activity .
