a lander is a spacecraft that descends towards , and comes to rest on , the surface of an astronomical body . in contrast to an impact probe , which makes a hard landing that damages or destroys the probe upon reaching the surface , a lander makes a soft landing after which the probe remains functional . for bodies with atmospheres , the landing occurs after atmospheric entry . in these cases , landers may employ parachutes to slow them down enough to maintain a low terminal velocity . in some cases , small landing rockets will be fired just before impact in order to reduce the lander 's velocity . landing may be accomplished by attitude control and set down on landing gear , with the possible addition of a post-landing attachment mechanism ( such as the mechanism used by philae ) for celestial bodies with low gravity . some missions ( for example , luna 9 and mars pathfinder ) used inflatable airbags to cushion the lander 's impact rather than utilizing more traditional landing gear . when a high velocity impact is intentionally planned in order to study the consequences of impact , the spacecraft is called an impactor . several terrestrial planet have been subject to lander or impactor exploration . among them are earth 's moon ; the planets venus , mars , and mercury ; saturn 's moon titan ; and asteroids and comets .
