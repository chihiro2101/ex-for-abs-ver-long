hemorrhoids are typically diagnosed by physical examination . a visual examination of the anus and surrounding area may diagnose external or prolapsed hemorrhoids . a rectal exam may be performed to detect possible rectal tumors , polyps , an enlarged prostate , or abscesses . this examination may not be possible without appropriate sedation because of pain , although most internal hemorrhoids are not associated with pain . visual confirmation of internal hemorrhoids may require anoscopy , insertion of a hollow tube device with a light attached at one end . the two types of hemorrhoids are external and internal . these are differentiated by their position with respect to the pectinate line . some persons may concurrently have symptomatic versions of both . if pain is present , the condition is more likely to be an anal fissure or an external hemorrhoid rather than an internal hemorrhoid .
