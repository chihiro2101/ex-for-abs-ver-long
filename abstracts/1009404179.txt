tejanos ; singular : tejano/a ; spanish for '' texan '' ) are the hispanic residents of the state of texas who are culturally descended from the original spanish-speaking settlers of tejas , coahuila , and other northern mexican states . they may be variously of criollo people or mestizo origin . alongside californios and neomexicanos , tejanos are part of the larger chicano/mexican-american/hispano community of the united states , who have lived in the american southwest since the 16th century . historically , the spanish term tejano has been used to identify various groups of people . during the spanish colonial era , the term was primarily applied to spanish settlers of the region now known as the state of texas , which was first part of new spain and after 1821 was part of mexico . after settlers entered from the united states and gained the independence of the republic of texas , the term was applied to mostly spanish-speaking texans , hispanicized germans , and other spanish-speaking residents . in practice , many members of traditionally tejano communities often have varying degrees of fluency in spanish , with some having virtually no spanish proficiency , though they are still considered culturally part of the community . since the early 20th century , tejano has been more broadly used to identify a texan mexican american . it is also a term used to identify natives , as opposed to newcomers , in the areas settled . latino people of texas identify as tejano if their ancestors were living there before the area was controlled by anglo americans .
