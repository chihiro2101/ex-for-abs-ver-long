the shetland sheepdog , often known as the sheltie , is a breed of herding dog that originated in the shetland islands of scotland . the original name was shetland collie , but this caused controversy among the rough collie breeders of the time , so the breed 's name was formally changed . this hard-working small dog is intelligent , vocal , excitable and willing to please . they are incredibly loyal to their owners to the point where they are often referred to as '' shadows '' due to their attachment to family . this breed was formally recognized by the kennel club ( uk ) in 1909 . like the shetland pony , shetland cattle and the shetland sheep , the shetland sheepdog is a hardy but diminutive breed developed to thrive amidst the harsh and meagre conditions of shetland islands . while the sheltie still excels at herding , today it is often raised as a farm dog and/or pet dog .
