the geneva bible is one of the most historically significant translations of the bible into english , preceding the king james version by 51 years . it was the primary bible of 16th-century english protestantism and was used by william shakespeare , oliver cromwell , john knox , john donne , and john bunyan , author of the pilgrim 's progress ( 1678 ) . . it was one of the bibles taken to america on the mayflower . ( pilgrim hall museum has collected several bibles of mayflower passengers . ) the geneva bible was used by many english dissenters , and it was still respected by oliver cromwell 's soldiers at the time of the english civil war , in the booklet '' cromwell 's soldiers ' pocket bible '' . this version of the bible is significant because , for the first time , a mechanically printed , mass-produced bible was made available directly to the general public which came with a variety of scriptural study guides and aids ( collectively called an apparatus ) , which included verse citations that allow the reader to cross-reference one verse with numerous relevant verses in the rest of the bible , introductions to each book of the bible that acted to summarize all of the material that each book would cover , maps , tables , woodcut and indices . because the language of the geneva bible was more forceful and vigorous , most readers strongly preferred this version to the great bible . in the words of cleland boyd mcafee , '' it drove the great bible off the field by sheer power of excellence '' . .
