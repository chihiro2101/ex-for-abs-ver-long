nasa accepted the proposal provided that the costs be kept under 30 million , excluding launcher and data analysis . due to cost overruns in the explorer program due to iras , work on constructing the satellite at goddard space flight center ( gsfc ) did not begin until 1981 . to save costs , the infrared detectors and liquid helium dewar on cobe would be similar to those used on iras . cobe was originally planned to be launched on a space shuttle mission sts-82-b in 1988 from vandenberg air force base , but the sts-51-l delayed this plan when the shuttles were grounded . nasa kept cobe 's engineers from going to other space agencies to launch cobe , but eventually , a redesigned cobe was placed into sun-synchronous orbit on november 18 , 1989 aboard a delta rocket . a team of american scientists announced , on april 23 , 1992 that they had found the primordial '' seeds '' ( cmbe anisotropy ) in data from cobe . the announcement was reported worldwide as a fundamental scientific discovery and ran on the front page of the new york times . the nobel prize in physics for 2006 was jointly awarded to john c . mather , nasa goddard space flight center , and george f . smoot , university of california , berkeley , '' for their discovery of the blackbody form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation .
