the opium wars were two wars waged between western powers and the qing dynasty in the mid-19th century . the first opium war , fought in 1839–1842 between great britain and the qing dynasty , was triggered by the qing ’ s crackdown on british opium smugglers . the second opium war was fought between britain and france coalition against the qing in 1856–1860 . in each war , the european force 's modern military technology led to an easy victory over the qing forces , with the consequence that the government was compelled to grant favorable tariffs , trade concessions , and territory to the europeans . the wars and the subsequently-imposed treaties weakened the qing dynasty and chinese governments , and forced china to open specified treaty ports ( especially shanghai ) that handled all trade with imperial powers . in addition china gave the sovereignty over hong kong to britain . the massive taiping rebellion and smaller dungan revolt had a large negative effect on the economy .
