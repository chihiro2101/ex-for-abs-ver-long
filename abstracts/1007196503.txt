pirate radio or a pirate radio station is a radio station that broadcasts without a valid license . in some cases radio stations are considered legal where the signal is transmitted , but illegal where the signals are received & mdash ; especially when the signals cross a national boundary . in other cases , a broadcast may be considered '' pirate '' due to the nature of its content , its transmission format ( especially a failure to transmit a station identification according to regulations ) , or the transmit power ( wattage ) of the station , even if the transmission is not technically illegal ( such as an amateur radio transmission ) . pirate radio is sometimes called bootleg radio ( a term especially associated with two-way radio ) , clandestine radio ( associated with heavily politically motivated operations ) or free radio .
