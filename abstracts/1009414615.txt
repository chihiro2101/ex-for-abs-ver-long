during the 13th century the geats ; ; ; , sometimes called goths , e.g . encarta ( on swedish history ) , translations from old norse , anglo-saxon or latin and the primary chronicle and some modern scholarly works on germanic tribes . were a north germanic tribe who inhabited ( '' land of the geats '' ) in modern southern sweden during the middle ages . they are one of the progenitor groups of modern swedes , along with swedes and gutes . the name of the geats also lives on in the swedish provinces of and , the western and eastern lands of the geats , and in many other toponyms . how the geats of sweden were related to the goths has been debated for centuries . there have also been some attempts by scholars to separate the gÄ“atas in beowulf from the people in mainland sweden and instead identify it with other scandinavian tribes , but these have not gotten widespread support .
