in linguistics , hyponymy ( from greek ὑπό , hupó , '' under '' , and ὄνυμα , ónuma , '' name '' ) is a semantics between a hyponym denoting a subtype and a hypernym or hyperonym denoting a supertype . in other words , the semantic field of the hyponym is included within that of the hypernym . in simpler terms , a hyponym is in a ontology components with its hypernym . for example : pigeon , crow , eagle , and seagull are all hyponyms of bird , their hypernym ; which itself is a hyponym of animal , its hypernym . hypernymy or hyperonymy ( from greek ὑπέρ , hupér , '' over '' , and ὄνυμα , ónuma , '' name '' ) is the converse of hyponymy . other names for hypernym include umbrella term and blanket term . a synonym of co-hyponym based on same tier ( and not hyponymic ) relation is allonym ( which means '' different name '' ) . a hyponym refers to a type . a meronym refers to a part . for example , a hyponym of tree is pine tree or oak tree ( a type of tree ) , but a meronym of tree is bark or leaf ( a part of tree ) .
