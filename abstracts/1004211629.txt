in computer architecture , cache coherence is the uniformity of shared resource data that ends up stored in multiple local caches . when clients in a system maintain caches of a common memory resource , problems may arise with incoherent data , which is particularly the case with cpus in a multiprocessing system . in the illustration on the right , consider both the clients have a cached copy of a particular memory block from a previous read . suppose the client on the bottom updates/changes that memory block , the client on the top could be left with an invalid cache of memory without any notification of the change . cache coherence is intended to manage such conflicts by maintaining a coherent view of the data values in multiple caches .
