in humanâ€“computer interaction and user interface design , cut , copy , and paste are related commands that offer an interprocess communication technique for transferring data through a computer 's user interface . the cut command removes the selected data from its original position , while the copy command creates a duplicate ; in both cases the selected data is kept in temporary storage ( the clipboard ) . the data from the clipboard is later inserted wherever a paste command is issued . the data remains available to any application supporting the feature , thus allowing easy data transfer between applications . the command names are an interface metaphor based on the physical procedure used in manuscript editing to create a page layout . this interaction technique has close associations with related techniques in graphical user interfaces ( guis ) that use pointing devices such as a computer mouse ( by drag and drop , for example ) . typically , clipboard support is provided by an operating system as part of its gui and widget toolkit . the capability to replicate information with ease , changing it between contexts and applications , involves privacy concerns because of the risks of disclosure when handling sensitive information . terms like cloning , copy forward , carry forward , or re-use refer to the dissemination of such information through documents , and may be subject to regulation by administrative body .
