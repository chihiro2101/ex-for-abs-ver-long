the network time protocol ( ntp ) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched , variable-latency data networks . in operation since before 1985 , ntp is one of the oldest internet protocols in current use . ntp was designed by david l . mills of the university of delaware . ntp is intended to synchronize all participating computers to within a few milliseconds of coordinated universal time ( utc ) . it uses the intersection algorithm , a modified version of marzullo 's algorithm , to select accurate time servers and is designed to mitigate the effects of variable network latency . ntp can usually maintain time to within tens of milliseconds over the public internet , and can achieve better than one millisecond accuracy in local area networks under ideal conditions . asymmetric routes and network congestion can cause errors of 100 & nbsp ; ms or more . the protocol is usually described in terms of a client-server model , but can as easily be used in peer-to-peer relationships where both peers consider the other to be a potential time source . implementations send and receive timestamps using the user datagram protocol ( udp ) on port number 123 . they can also use broadcasting or multicasting , where clients passively listen to time updates after an initial round-trip calibrating exchange . ntp supplies a warning of any impending leap second adjustment , but no information about local time zones or daylight saving time is transmitted . the current protocol is version 4 ( ntpv4 ) , which is a proposed standard as documented in . it is backward compatible with version 3 , specified in .
