right the oil drop experiment was performed by robert a . millikan and harvey fletcher in 1909 to measure the elementary charge ( the charge of the electron ) . the experiment took place in the ryerson physical laboratory at the university of chicago . millikan received the nobel prize in physics in 1923 . the experiment entailed observing tiny electrically charged droplets of oil located between two parallel metal surfaces , forming the plates of a capacitor . the plates were oriented horizontally , with one plate above the other . a mist of atomized oil drops was introduced through a small hole in the top plate and was ionized by an x-ray , making them negatively charged . first , with zero applied electric field , the velocity of a falling droplet was measured . at terminal velocity , the drag force equals the gravity force . as both forces depend on the radius in different ways , the radius of the droplet , and therefore the mass and gravitational force , could be determined ( using the known density of the oil ) . next , a voltage inducing an electric field was applied between the plates and adjusted until the drops were suspended in mechanical equilibrium , indicating that the electrical force and the gravitational force were in balance . using the known electric field , millikan and fletcher could determine the charge on the oil droplet . by repeating the experiment for many droplets , they confirmed that the charges were all small integer multiples of a certain base value , which was found to be , about 0.6 % difference from the currently accepted value of they proposed that this was the magnitude of the negative charge of a single electron .
