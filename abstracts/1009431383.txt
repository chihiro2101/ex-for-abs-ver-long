was an english poet and hymnodist . one of the most popular poets of his time , cowper changed the direction of 18th-century nature poetry by writing of everyday life and scenes of the english countryside . in many ways , he was one of the forerunners of romantic poetry . samuel taylor coleridge called him '' the best modern poet '' , whilst william wordsworth particularly admired his poem yardley-oak . after being institutionalised for insanity , cowper found refuge in a fervent evangelical christianity . he continued to suffer doubt and , after a dream in 1773 , believed that he was doomed to eternal damnation . he recovered and wrote more religious hymns . his religious sentiment and association with john newton ( who wrote the hymn '' amazing grace '' ) led to much of the poetry for which he is best remembered , and to the series of olney hymns . his poem '' light shining out of darkness '' gave english the phrase : '' god moves in a mysterious way/ his wonders to perform . '' he also wrote a number of anti-slavery poems and his friendship with newton , who was an avid anti-slavery campaigner , resulted in cowper being asked to write in support of the abolitionism . cowper wrote a poem called '' the negro 's complaint '' ( 1788 ) which rapidly became very famous , and was often quoted by martin luther king jr . during the 20th-century civil rights movement . . he also wrote several other less well known poems on slavery in the 1780s , many of which attacked the idea that slavery was economically viable . .
