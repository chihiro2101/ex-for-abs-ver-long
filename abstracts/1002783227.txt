the black knight is a fictional character who appears in a scene of the feature film monty python and the holy grail . as his name suggests , he is a knight dressed in black and behaves similarly to the standard character , a black knight . he guards a '' bridge '' ( in reality a short plank of wood ) over a small streamâ€”which could have been easily stepped over by king arthur but , for unknown reasons , he does not . although supremely skilled in swordplay , the black knight suffers from unchecked overconfidence and a staunch refusal ever to give up .
