exponential growth is a process that increases quantity over time . it occurs when the instantaneous rate of change ( that is , the derivative ) of a quantity with respect to time is proportional to the quantity itself . described as a function , a quantity undergoing exponential growth is an exponential function of time , that is , the variable representing time is the exponent ( in contrast to other types of growth , such as quadratic growth ) . if the constant of proportionality is negative , then the quantity decreases over time , and is said to be undergoing exponential decay instead . in the case of a discrete domain of definition with equal intervals , it is also called geometric growth or geometric decay since the function values form a geometric progression . the formula for exponential growth of a variable x at the growth rate r , as time t goes on in discrete intervals ( that is , at integer times & nbsp ; 0 , & nbsp ; 1 , & nbsp ; 2 , & nbsp ; 3 , & nbsp ; . ) , is : x_t x_0 ( 1+r ) ^t where x 0 is the value of x at time 0 . the growth of a bacterial colony is often used to illustrate it . one bacterium splits itself into two , each of which splits itself resulting in four , then eight , 16 , 32 , and so on . the rate of increase keeps increasing because it is proportional to the ever-increasing number of bacteria . growth like this is observed in real-life activity or phenomena , such as the spread of virus infection , the growth of debt due to compound interest , and the spread of viral videos . in real cases , initial exponential growth often does not last forever , instead slowing down eventually due to upper limits caused by external factors and turning into logistic curve .
