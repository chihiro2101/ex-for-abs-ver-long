glam metal , also known as hair metal or pop metal , is a subgenre of heavy metal , which features pop-influenced hooks and guitar riffs , and borrows heavily from the fashion and image of 1970s glam rock . early glam metal evolved directly from the glam rock movement of the 1970s , as visual elements taken from acts such as t . rex , the new york dolls , and david bowie ( and to a lesser extent , the punk and new wave movements taking place concurrently in new york city ) were fused with the decidedly more heavy metal leaning and theatrical acts such as alice cooper and kiss . the first examples of this fusion began appearing in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the united states , particularly on the los angeles sunset strip music scene , pioneered by bands such as mötley crüe , ratt , quiet riot , twisted sister , stryper , def leppard , bon jovi , and dokken . glam metal achieved huge commercial success from approximately 1981 to 1991 , bringing to prominence bands such as poison , skid row , cinderella and warrant . from a strictly visual perspective , glam metal is defined by flashy and tight-fitting clothing , makeup , and an overall androgynous aesthetic in which the traditional '' denim & leather '' aspect of heavy metal culture is replaced by spandex , lace , and heavy use of the color pink . glam metal suffered a decline in popularity in the early-mid 1990s , as the grunge and alternative phenomena revolutionized hard rock , and fans ' tastes moved toward a more natural and stripped-down aesthetic and a rejection of the glam metal visual style . during this period , many of the most successful acts of the genre 's 1980s pinnacle suddenly found themselves facing disbandment as their audiences moved in another direction . glam metal has experienced a resurgence since the late 1990s , with successful reunion tours of many popular acts from the genre 's 1980s heyday , as well as the emergence of new , predominantly european bands , including the darkness , crazy lixx , santa cruz , reckless love , the struts , and american band steel panther .
