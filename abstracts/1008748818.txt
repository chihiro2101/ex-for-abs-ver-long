biological control or biocontrol is a method of pest control such as insects , mites , weeds and phytopathology bioeffector . it relies on predation , parasitism , herbivory , or other natural mechanisms , but typically also involves an active human management role . it can be an important component of integrated pest management ( ipm ) programs . there are three basic strategies for biological pest control : classical ( importation ) , where a natural enemy of a pest is introduced in the hope of achieving control ; inductive ( augmentation ) , in which a large population of natural enemies are administered for quick pest control ; and inoculative ( conservation ) , in which measures are taken to maintain natural enemies through regular reestablishment . natural enemies of insect pests , also known as biological control agents , include predators , parasitoids , pathogens , and competitors . biological control agents of plant diseases are most often referred to as antagonists . biological control agents of weeds include seed predators , herbivores , and plant pathogens . biological control can have side-effects on biodiversity through attacks on non-target species by any of the above mechanisms , especially when a species is introduced without a thorough understanding of the possible consequences .
