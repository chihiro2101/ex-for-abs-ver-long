brugada syndrome ( brs ) is a genetic disorder in which the electrical activity within the heart is abnormal . it increases the risk of heart arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death . those affected may have episodes of passing out . the abnormal heart rhythms seen in those with brugada syndrome often occur at rest . they may be triggered by a fever . about a quarter of those with brugada syndrome have a family member who also has the condition . some cases may be due to a new genetic mutation or certain medications . the most commonly involved gene is scn5a which encodes the cardiac sodium channel . diagnosis is typically by electrocardiogram ( ecg ) , however , the abnormalities may not be consistently present . medications such as ajmaline may be used to reveal the ecg changes . similar ecg patterns may be seen in certain electrolyte imbalance or when the ischemia . there is no cure for brugada syndrome . those at higher risk of sudden cardiac death may be treated using an implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( icd ) . in those without symptoms the risk of death is much lower , and how to treat this group is less clear . isoproterenol may be used in the short term for those who have frequent life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms , while quinidine may be used longer term . testing people 's family members may be recommended . the condition affects between 1 and 30 per 10,000 people . it is more common in males than females and in those of asian descent . the onset of symptoms is usually in adulthood . it is named after the catalan cardiologists pedro and josep brugada who described the condition in 1992 . their brother ramon brugada was the first to describe one potential genetic cause in 1998 .
