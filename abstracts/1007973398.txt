mount waddington , once known as mystery mountain , is the highest peak in the coast mountains of british columbia , canada . although it is lower than mount fairweather and mount quincy adams , which straddle the united states border between alaska and british columbia , mount waddington is the highest peak that lies entirely within british columbia . it and the subrange which surround it , known as the waddington range , stand at the heart of the pacific ranges , a remote and extremely rugged set of mountains and river valleys . it is not as far north as its extreme arctic-like conditions might indicate , and mount waddington and its attendant peaks pose some of the most serious expedition mountaineering to be had in north america & mdash ; and some of the most extreme relief and spectacular mountain scenery . from waddington 's fang to sea level at the heads of bute and knight inlets is only a few miles ; across the gorges of the homathko and the klinaklini rivers stand mountains almost as high , and icefields even vaster and whiter , only a few aerial miles away , with a maw deeper than the grand canyon , comparable in relief to the himalayas ( to which the terrain of british columbia was compared by colonial-era travellers ) . mount waddington is the namesake of the mount waddington regional district , which takes in the seaward slope of the waddington range and the adjoining coastline and parts of northern vancouver island adjacent to queen charlotte strait .
