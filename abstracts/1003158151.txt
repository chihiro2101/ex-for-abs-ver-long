a knuckleball or knuckler is a baseball pitch thrown to minimize the spin of the ball in flight , causing an erratic , unpredictable motion . the air flow over a seam of the ball causes the ball to transition from laminar to turbulent flow . this transition adds a deflecting force to the baseball , making it difficult for batters to hit , but also difficult for pitchers to control and catchers to catch ; umpires are challenged as well , as the ball 's irregular motion through the air makes it harder to call balls and strikes . hoffman , benjamin .
