t-symmetry or time reversal symmetry is the theoretical symmetry ( physics ) under the transformation of time reversal , : t : t \mapsto -t . since the second law of thermodynamics states that entropy increases as time flows toward the future , in general , the macroscopic universe does not show symmetry under time reversal . in other words , time is said to be non-symmetric , or asymmetric , except for special equilibrium states when the second law of thermodynamics predicts the time symmetry to hold . however , quantum weak measurement are predicted to violate time symmetry even in equilibrium , contrary to their classical counterparts , although this has not yet been experimentally confirmed . time asymmetries generally are caused by one of three categories : intrinsic to the dynamic physical law ( e.g . , for the weak force ) due to the big bang ( e.g . , for the second law of thermodynamics ) due to measurements ( e.g . , for the noninvasive measurements )
