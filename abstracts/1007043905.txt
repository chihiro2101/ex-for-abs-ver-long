intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( icsi is an in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) procedure in which a single sperm cell is injected directly into the cytoplasm of an egg . this technique is used in order to prepare the gametes for the obtention of embryos that may be transferred to a maternal uterus . with this method , the acrosome reaction is skipped . there are several differences within classic ivf and icsi . however , the steps to be followed before and after insemination are the same . in terms of insemination , icsi needs one only sperm cell per oocyte , meanwhile ivf needs 50,000 - 100,000 . this is because the acrosome reaction has to take place and thousands of sperm cells have to be involved in ivf . once fertilized , the egg is transformed into a proembryo and it has to be transferred to the uterus to continue its development . the first human pregnancy generated by icsi was carried out in 1991 by gianpiero palermo and his team .
