a maypole is a tall wooden pole erected as a part of various european folk festivals , around which a maypole dance often takes place . the festivals may occur on midsummer ( june 20-26 ) or pentecost ( whitsun ) , although in some countries it is instead erected at midsummer . in some cases the maypole is a permanent feature that is only utilised during the festival , although in other cases it is erected specifically for the purpose before being taken down again . primarily found within the nations of germanic europe and the neighbouring areas which they have influenced , its origins remain unknown . it has often been speculated that the maypole originally had some importance in the germanic paganism of iron age and early medieval cultures , and that the tradition survived christianisation , albeit losing any original meaning that it had . it has been a recorded practice in many parts of europe throughout the medieval and early modern periods , although it became less popular in the 18th and 19th centuries . today , the tradition is still observed in some parts of europe and among european communities in the americas .
