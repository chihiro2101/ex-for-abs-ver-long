pepsin is an endopeptidase that breaks down proteins into smaller peptides . it is produced in the chief cells of the stomach lining and is one of the main digestive enzymes in the digestive systems of humans and many other animals , where it helps digest the proteins in food . pepsin is an aspartic protease , using a catalytic aspartate in its active site . it is one of three principal proteases in the human digestive system , the other two being chymotrypsin and trypsin . during the process of digestion , these enzymes , each of which is specialized in severing links between particular types of amino acids , collaborate to break down dietary proteins into their components , i.e . , peptides and amino acids , which can be readily small intestine absorption . the cleavage specificity of pepsin is broad , but some amino acids like tyrosine , phenylalanine and tryptophan increase the probability of cleavage . pepsin 's zymogen , pepsinogen , is released by the chief cells in the stomach wall , and upon mixing with the hydrochloric acid of the gastric acid , pepsinogen activates to become pepsin .
