edgar cayce ; 18 march 1877 & nbsp ; â€“ 3 january 1945 ) was an american clairvoyant who claimed , uniquely , to channel his own higher self . cayce 's channeling sessions happened in a trance state that he would induce with help from his friend al layne or his wife until later in life , when he became accustomed enough to do so on his own . during these sessions , cayce would answer questions on subjects as varied as healing , reincarnation , dreams , the afterlife , past-life , nutrition , atlantis and future events . as a devout christian and sunday school teacher , his channelling claims were a source of trouble for him because channelling was typically criticized by practitioners of his faith as being demonic . cayce , in contrast , believed that it was his subconscious exploring the dream realm , where he believed minds were eternity connected . cayce founded a nonprofit organization , the association for research and enlightenment , to store and facilitate the study of his channelings , as well as run a hospital . a biographer gave him the nickname the sleeping prophet . some consider him the true founder and a principal source of the most characteristic beliefs of the new age movement .
