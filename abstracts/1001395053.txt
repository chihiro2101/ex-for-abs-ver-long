an application server is a server that hosts applications . application server frameworks are software frameworks for building application servers . an application server framework provides both facilities to create web applications and a server environment to run them . an application server framework contains a comprehensive service layer model . it includes a set of components accessible to the software developer through a standard api defined for the platform itself . for web applications , these components usually run in the same environment as their web server ( s ) , and their main job is to support the construction of dynamic pages . however , many application servers do more than generate web pages : they implement services such as clustering , fail-over , and load-balancing , so developers can focus on implementing the business logic . in the case of java application servers , the server behaves like an extended jvm for running applications , transparently handling java persistence api on one side , and , often , javaserver pages on the other . other uses of the term may refer to the services that a server makes available or the computer hardware on which the services run .
