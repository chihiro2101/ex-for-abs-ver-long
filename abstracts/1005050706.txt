a distributed hash table ( dht ) is a distributed system that provides a lookup service similar to a hash table : key value pair are stored in a dht , and any participating node can efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given key . the main advantage of a dht is that nodes can be added or removed with minimum work around re-distributing keys . keys are unique identifiers which map to particular values , which in turn can be anything from addresses , to documents , to arbitrary data . responsibility for maintaining the mapping from keys to values is distributed among the nodes , in such a way that a change in the set of participants causes a minimal amount of disruption . this allows a dht to scale to extremely large numbers of nodes and to handle continual node arrivals , departures , and failures . dhts form an infrastructure that can be used to build more complex services , such as anycast , cooperative web cache , distributed file systems , domain name system , instant messaging , multicast , and also peer-to-peer file sharing and content distribution systems . notable distributed networks that use dhts include bittorrent 's distributed tracker , the coral content distribution network , the kad network , the storm botnet , the tox ( protocol ) , freenet , the yacy search engine , and the interplanetary file system .
