the battle of höchstädt was fought on 19 june 1800 on the north bank of the danube near höchstädt , and resulted in a french victory under general jean victor marie moreau against the austrians under baron pál kray . the austrians were subsequently forced back into the fortress town of ulm . instead of attacking the heavily fortified , walled city , which would result in massive losses of personnel and time , moreau dislodged kray 's supporting forces defending the danube passage further east . as a line of retreat eastward disappeared , kray quickly abandoned ulm , and withdrew into bavaria . this opened the danube pathway toward vienna . the danube passage connecting ulm , donauwörth , ingolstadt and regensburg had strategic importance in the ongoing competition for european hegemony between france and the holy roman empire ; the army that commanded the danube , especially its passage through württemberg and bavaria , could command access to the important cities of munich and the seat of habsburg authority : vienna . the end result of the battle was the opposite of what had occurred on those same fields almost 100 years earlier , when the armies of the grand alliance had faced the armies of france during the war of the spanish succession . at the second battle of höchstädt in 1704 , called the battle of blenheim by the english , the overwhelming allied victory ensured the safety of vienna from the franco-bavarian army , thus preventing the collapse of the grand alliance . france 's loss during that engagement opened the pathway into france for the allied english and austrian forces .
