the bmw 801 was a powerful german air-cooled 14-cylinder-radial aircraft engine built by bmw and used in a number of german luftwaffe aircraft of world war ii . production versions of the twin-row engine generated between 1,560 and 2,000 ps ( 1,540–1,970 & nbsp ; hp , or 1,150–1,470 kw ) . it was the most produced radial engine of germany in world war ii with more than 61,000 built . the 801 was originally intended to replace existing radial types in german transport and utility aircraft . at the time , it was widely agreed among european designers that an inline engine was a requirement for high performance designs due to its smaller frontal area and resulting lower drag . kurt tank successfully fitted a bmw 801 to a new fighter design he was working on , and as a result the 801 became best known as the power plant for the famous focke-wulf fw 190 . the bmw 801 radial also pioneered the use of what would today be designated an engine control unit : its kommandogerät engine management system took over the operation of several aviation engine management control parameters of the era , allowing proper operation of the engine with just one throttle lever . gunston ( 2006 ) , p . 28
