lou grant is a fictional character played by ed asner in two television series produced by mtm enterprises for cbs . the first was the mary tyler moore show ( 1970–1977 ) , a half-hour light-hearted situation comedy in which the character was the news director at fictional television station wjm-tv in minneapolis . a spinoff series , entitled lou grant ( 1977–1982 ) , was an hour-long serious dramatic series that frequently engaged in social commentary , featuring the character as city editor of the fictional los angeles tribune . although spin-offs are common on american television , lou grant remains one of a very few characters ( played by the same actor ) to have a leading role on both a popular comedy and a popular dramatic series ( e.g . trapper john mcintyre , played by two actors ) .
