choking occurs when breathing is impeded by a constricted or obstructed throat or windpipe . in some cases the air flow is completely blocked , in other cases some amount of air can pass to the lungs . insufficient oxygen being delivered to the body will result in oxygen deprivation . although oxygen stored in the blood and lungs can keep a person alive for several minutes after breathing stops , this sequence of events can lead to death . choking was the fourth most common cause of unintentional injury-related death in the us in 2011 . deaths from choking most often occur in the very young ( children under 2 years old ) and in the elderly ( adults over 75 years ) . obstruction of the airway can occur at the level of the pharynx or the trachea . foods that can adapt their shape to that of the pharynx ( such as bananas , marshmallows , or gelatinous candies ) can be a danger not just for children but for persons of any age . choking is one type of airway obstruction , which includes any blockage of the air-conducting passages , including blockage due to tumors , swelling of the airway tissues , and compression of the laryngopharynx , larynx or vertebrate trachea in strangulation .
