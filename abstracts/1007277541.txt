the holy roman empire was a highly decentralized state for most of its history , composed of hundreds of smaller states , most of which operated with some degree of independent sovereignty . although in the earlier part of the middle ages , under the salian and hohenstaufen emperors , it was relatively centralized , as time went on the emperor lost more and more power to the princes . the membership of the imperial diet in 1792 , late in the empire 's history but before the beginning of the french revolutionary wars , gives some insight as to the composition of the holy roman empire at that time .
