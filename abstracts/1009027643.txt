ebsen became famous as jed clampett , an easygoing backwoods mountaineer who strikes oil and moves with his family to beverly hills , california , in the long-running , fish-out-of-water cbs sitcom the beverly hillbillies . aside from the top-billed ebsen , principal cast members included irene ryan as jed 's mother-in-law , daisy moses , also known as granny ; max baer jr . as jed 's dimwitted nephew jethro bodine ; donna douglas as jed 's only child , the curvaceous , critter-loving elly may clampett ; raymond bailey as milburn drysdale , a bank president who oversees the clampett fortune ; and nancy kulp as jane hathaway , drysdale 's secretary . although scorned by critics , the beverly hillbillies attracted as many as 60 million viewers between 1962 and 1971 and was several times the highest-rated series on television . the show also spawned similar paul henning-produced rural sitcoms such as green acres and petticoat junction , which were eventually linked in crossover episode arcs . the beverly hillbillies was still earning good ratings when it was cancelled by cbs ( because programmers rural purge ) . one episode , '' the giant jack rabbit '' , was the highest-rated half-hour on television to that time and remains the most-watched half-hour sitcom episode . not all was harmonious among cast members on the beverly hillbillies set , especially between the politically conservative ebsen and the more liberal kulp . said douglas , '' they had a different view , so they had some heated discussions about that . they would go at it for weeks . '' in 1984 , kulp unsuccessfully ran for the u.s . house of representatives as a democrat from pennsylvania . to her dismay , ebsen supported her republican opponent , incumbent representative bud shuster , going so far as to tape an ad for shuster that labeled kulp as '' too liberal '' . ebsen claimed she was exploiting her celebrity status and did not know the issues .
