image : disqvisitiones-800.jpg thumb title page of the first edition of disquisitiones arithmeticae , one of the founding works of modern algebraic number theory . algebraic number theory is a branch of number theory that uses the techniques of abstract algebra to study the integers , rational numbers , and their generalizations . number-theoretic questions are expressed in terms of properties of algebraic objects such as algebraic number fields and their rings of integers , finite fields , and function fields . these properties , such as whether a ring admits unique factorization , the behavior of ideals , and the galois groups of fields , can resolve questions of primary importance in number theory , like the existence of solutions to diophantine equations .
