a barnacle is a type of arthropod constituting the infraclass cirripedia in the subphylum crustacea , and is hence related to crabs and lobsters . barnacles are exclusively marine , and tend to live in shallow and tidal waters , typically in erosive settings . they are sessile ( nonmobile ) and most are filter feeder , but those in superorder rhizocephala are parasitic . they have four nektonic ( active swimming ) larval stages . around 1,000 barnacle species are currently known . the name '' cirripedia '' is latin , meaning '' curl-footed '' . the study of barnacles is called cirripedology .
