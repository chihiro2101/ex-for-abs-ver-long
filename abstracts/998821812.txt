neurolinguistics is the study of the neuron mechanisms in the human brain that control the comprehension , production , and acquisition of language . as an interdisciplinary field , neurolinguistics draws methods and theories from fields such as neuroscience , linguistics , cognitive science , communication disorders and neuropsychology . researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds , bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives . much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in psycholinguistics and theoretical linguistics , and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language . neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language , and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories , using aphasiology , brain imaging , electrophysiology , and computer modeling .
