sir arthur edward drummond bliss ( 2 august 189127 march 1975 ) was an english composer and conductor . bliss 's musical training was cut short by the first world war , in which he served with distinction in the army . in the post-war years he quickly became known as an unconventional and modernist composer , but within the decade he began to display a more traditional and romantic side in his music . in the 1920s and 1930s he composed extensively not only for the concert hall , but also for films and ballet . in the second world war , bliss returned to england from the us to work for the bbc and became its director of music . after the war he resumed his work as a composer , and was appointed master of the queen 's music . in bliss 's later years , his work was respected but was thought old-fashioned , and it was eclipsed by the music of younger colleagues such as william walton and benjamin britten . since his death , his compositions have been well represented in recordings , and many of his better-known works remain in the repertoire of british orchestras .
