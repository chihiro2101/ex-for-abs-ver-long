high frequency ( hf ) is the itu designation for the range of radio frequency electromagnetic waves ( radio waves ) between 3 and 30 megahertz ( mhz ) . it is also known as the decameter band or decameter wave as its wavelengths range from one to ten decametre ( ten to one hundred meters ) . frequencies immediately below hf are denoted medium frequency ( mf ) , while the next band of higher frequencies is known as the very high frequency ( vhf ) band . the hf band is a major part of the shortwave band of frequencies , so communication at these frequencies is often called shortwave radio . because radio waves in this band can be reflected back to earth by the ionosphere layer in the atmosphere – & nbsp ; a method known as '' skip '' or '' skywave '' propagation & nbsp ; – these frequencies are suitable for long-distance communication across intercontinental distances and for mountainous terrains which prevent line-of-sight communications . the band is used by international shortwave broadcasting stations ( 3.95–25.82 & nbsp ; mhz ) , aviation communication , government time stations , weather stations , amateur radio and citizens band services , among other uses .
