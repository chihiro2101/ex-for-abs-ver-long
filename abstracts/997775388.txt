in computer science , dynamic recompilation ( sometimes abbreviated to dynarec or the pseudo-acronym drc ) is a feature of some emulators and virtual machines , where the system may compiler some part of a program during execution . by compiling during execution , the system can tailor the generated code to reflect the program 's run-time environment , and potentially produce more efficient code by exploiting information that is not available to a traditional static compiler .
