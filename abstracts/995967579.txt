the kingsway tramway subway is a cut-and-cover grade ii listed tunnel in central london , built by the london county council , and the only one of its kind in britain . the decision in 1898 to clear slum districts in the holborn area provided an opportunity to use the new streets for a tramway connecting the lines in the north and south . following the pattern of tramways in new york ( the murray hill tunnel ) and boston ( the mbta green line ) , it was decided to build this as an underground connection .
