chromatophores are cells that produce color , of which many types are pigment-containing cells , or groups of cells , found in a wide range of animals including amphibians , fish , reptiles , crustaceans and cephalopods . mammals and birds , in contrast , have a class of cells called melanocytes for coloration . chromatophores are largely responsible for generating skin and eye color in ectothermic animals and are generated in the neural crest during embryonic development . mature chromatophores are grouped into subclasses based on their colour ( more properly '' hue '' ) under white light : xanthophores ( yellow ) , erythrophores ( red ) , iridophores ( reflective / iridescent ) , leucophores ( white ) , melanophores ( black/brown ) , and cyanophores ( blue ) . while most chromatorphores contain pigments that absorb specific wavelengths of light , the color of leucophores and iridophores is produced by their respective scattering and optical interference properties . some species can rapidly change colour through mechanisms that translocate pigment and reorient reflective plates within chromatophores . this process , often used as a type of camouflage , is called physiological colour change or metachrosis . cephalopods such as the octopus have complex chromatophore organs controlled by muscles to achieve this , whereas vertebrates such as chameleons generate a similar effect by cell signaling . such signals can be hormones or neurotransmitters and may be initiated by changes in mood , temperature , stress or visible changes in the local environment . chromatophores are studied by scientists to understand human disease and as a tool in drug discovery .
