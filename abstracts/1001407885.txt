calf roping , also known as tie-down roping , is a rodeo event that features a calf and a rider mounted on a horse . the goal of this timed event is for the rider to catch the calf by throwing a loop of rope from a lasso around its neck , dismount from the horse , run to the calf , and restrain it by tying three legs together , in as short a time as possible . a variant on the sport , with fewer animal welfare controversies , is breakaway roping , where the calf is roped , but not tied .
