in mathematics , hilbert 's second problem was posed by david hilbert in 1900 as one of his 23 problems . it asks for a proof that the arithmetic is consistent & ndash ; free of any internal contradictions . hilbert stated that the axioms he considered for arithmetic were the ones given in , which include a second order completeness axiom . in the 1930s , kurt gödel and gerhard gentzen proved results that cast new light on the problem . some feel that gödel 's theorems give a negative solution to the problem , while others consider gentzen 's proof as a partial positive solution .
