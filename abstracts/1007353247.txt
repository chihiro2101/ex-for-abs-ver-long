in computing , open database connectivity ( odbc ) is a standard application programming interface ( api ) for accessing database management systems ( dbms ) . the designers of odbc aimed to make it independent of database systems and operating systems . an application written using odbc can be ported to other platforms , both on the client and server side , with few changes to the data access code . odbc accomplishes dbms independence by using an odbc driver as a translation layer between the application and the dbms . the application uses odbc functions through an odbc driver manager with which it is linked , and the driver passes the query to the dbms . an odbc driver can be thought of as analogous to a printer driver or other driver , providing a standard set of functions for the application to use , and implementing dbms-specific functionality . an application that can use odbc is referred to as '' odbc-compliant '' . any odbc-compliant application can access any dbms for which a driver is installed . drivers exist for all major dbmss , many other data sources like address book systems and microsoft excel , and even for text or comma-separated values ( csv ) files . odbc was originally developed by microsoft and simba technologies during the early 1990s , and became the basis for the call level interface ( cli ) standardized by sql access group in the unix and mainframe field . odbc retained several features that were removed as part of the cli effort . full odbc was later ported back to those platforms , and became a de facto standard considerably better known than cli . the cli remains similar to odbc , and applications can be ported from one platform to the other with few changes .
