saturday-morning cartoon '' is a colloquial term for the original animated series programming that was typically scheduled on saturday mornings in the united states on the '' big three '' television networks . the genre 's popularity had a broad peak from the mid-1960s through the mid-1990s ; after that point it declined , in the face of changing cultural norms , increased competition from formats available at all times , and heavier regulations . in the last two decades of the genre 's existence , saturday-morning cartoons were primarily created and aired to meet regulations on children 's television programming in the united states , or e/i . minor television networks , in addition to the non-commercial pbs in some markets , continue to air animated programming on saturday while partially meeting those mandates . in the united states , the generally accepted times for these and other children 's programs to air on saturday mornings were from 8:00 & nbsp ; a.m . to noon eastern time zone . until the late 1970s , american networks also had a schedule of children 's programming on sunday mornings , though most programs at this time were repeats of saturday-morning shows that were already out of production . in some markets , some shows were pre-empted in favor of syndicated or other types of local programming . saturday-morning cartoons were largely discontinued in canada by 2002 . in the united states , the cw continued to air non-e/i cartoons as late as 2014 ; among the '' big three '' traditional major networks , the last non-e/i cartoon ( kim possible ) last aired in 2006 . cable television networks have since then revived the practice of debuting their most popular animated programming on saturday mornings on a sporadic basis .
