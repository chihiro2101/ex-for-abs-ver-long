the battle of uclés ( 13 january 1809 ) saw an imperial french corps led by marshal claude perrin victor attack a spanish force under francisco javier venegas . the french easily crushed their outnumbered foes , capturing over half of the spanish infantry . uclés is located in the province of cuenca east of tarancón and southeast of madrid . the action occurred during what is called the peninsular war in english-speaking countries and the spanish war of independence in spain . the war was part of a larger struggle known as the napoleonic wars . emperor napoleon invaded spain with a huge army in late 1808 , scattered the spanish forces , and seized madrid . however , the appearance of a british army commanded by john moore caused the french emperor to order his army to pursue the british into northwest spain . with their enemies spread thin , the spanish armies began to revive . in late december 1808 , the army of the center led by pedro de alcántara álvarez de toledo , 13th duke of the infantado advanced slowly toward madrid , causing alarm among the scanty french forces guarding the capital . the cautious infantado sent his lieutenant venegas with a strong vanguard to annoy the french . after venegas won a minor action at tarancón , victor concentrated his corps and marched against him in mid-january 1809 . without instructions or support from infantado , venegas unwisely tried to hold a strong position at uclés . victor overwhelmed the spanish defenders with one division and herded many of them into the arms of his second division which had marched around their flank . gathering up venegas ' survivors , infantado led his crippled army into the mountains but not before losing much of his artillery . blamed for the fiasco , infantado was relieved of command . the next action in the area was the battle of ciudad real in march .
