in computing , protected mode , also called protected virtual address mode , is an operational mode of x86-compatible central processing units ( cpus ) . it allows system software to use features such as virtual memory , paging and safe multi-tasking designed to increase an operating system 's control over application software . when a processor that supports x86 protected mode is powered on , it begins executing instructions in real mode , in order to maintain backward compatibility with earlier x86 processors . protected mode may only be entered after the system software sets up one descriptor table and enables the protection enable ( pe ) bit in the control register 0 ( cr0 ) . protected mode was first added to the x86 architecture in 1982 , with the release of intel 's 80286 ( 286 ) processor , and later extended with the release of the 80386 ( 386 ) in 1985 . due to the enhancements added by protected mode , it has become widely adopted and has become the foundation for all subsequent enhancements to the x86 architecture , although many of those enhancements , such as added instructions and new registers , also brought benefits to the real mode .
