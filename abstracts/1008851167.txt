itv channel television , previously channel television , is a british television station which has served as the itv contractor for the channel islands since 1962 . it is based in jersey and broadcasts regional programme for insertion into the network itv schedule . until november 2011 , channel television was one of four itv companies independent from itv plc alongside the two stv regions in scotland and utv in northern ireland . the station has been owned by itv plc since 2012 and the licence was transferred to itv broadcasting limited in march 2017 . according to www.companieshouse.gov.uk , the previous two companies called '' channel television ltd '' were converted or closed on 30 july 2012 . the current legal company is '' channel television holdings ltd '' . unlike all other regional companies owned by itv plc , it is not listed on www.companieshouse.gov.uk as a '' dormant company '' . instead its nature of business is listed as '' television programme production activities '' and it is registered with the jersey companies registry as a live company . also unlike the other itv plc-owned companies , the franchise licence has not been transferred to itv broadcasting ltd but remains held by the channel television company itself . until the takeover by itv plc , channel television also had a responsibility to ensure independent productions for itv complied with the regulator ofcom 's broadcasting rules . until the regulations changed , ofcom could only impose a maximum fine of 5 % of the revenue of the company responsible for compliance , and as channel was by far the smallest itv contractor , this minimised the potential fines to which itv as a whole would be exposed . channel handled compliance for programmes including the x factor , midsomer murders and the british comedy awards . the station 's main competitor is the bbc , which operates an opt-out of the south west england news programme spotlight .
