a gentleman ( old french : gentilz hom , gentle + man ) is any man of good and courteous conduct . originally , gentleman was the lowest rank of the landed gentry of england , ranking below an esquire and above a yeoman ; by definition , the rank of gentleman comprised the younger sons of the younger sons of peers , and the younger sons of a baronet , a knight , and an esquire , in perpetual succession . as such , the connotation of the term gentleman captures the common denominator of gentility ( and often a armiger ) ; a right shared by the peerage and the gentry , the constituent classes of the british nobility . therefore , the english social category of gentleman corresponds to the french gentilhomme ( nobleman ) , which in great britain meant a member of the peerage of england . in that context , the historian maurice keen said that the social category of gentleman is '' the nearest , contemporary english equivalent of the noblesse of france . '' in the 14th century , the term gentlemen comprised the hereditary ruling class , which is whom the rebels of the peasants ' revolt ( 1381 ) meant when they repeated : in the 17th century , in titles of honour ( 1614 ) , the jurist john selden said that the title gentleman likewise speaks of '' our english use of it '' as convertible with nobilis ( nobility by rank or personal quality ) and describes the forms of a man 's elevation to the nobility in european monarchies . in the 19th century , james henry lawrence explained and discussed the concepts , particulars , and functions of social rank in a monarchy , in the book on the nobility of the british gentry , or the political ranks and dignities of the british empire , compared with those on the continent ( 1827 ) . lawrence , 1827 .
