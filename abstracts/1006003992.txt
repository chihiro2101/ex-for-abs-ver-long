a sonic boom is a sound associated with shock waves created when an object travels through the air faster than the speed of sound . sonic booms generate enormous amounts of sound energy , sounding similar to an explosion or a thunderclap to the human ear . the crack of a supersonic bullet passing overhead or the crack of a bullwhip are examples of a sonic boom in miniature . sonic booms due to large supersonic aircraft can be particularly loud and startling , tend to awaken people , and may cause minor damage to some structures . they led to prohibition of routine supersonic flight over land . although they can not be completely prevented , research suggests that with careful shaping of the vehicle , the nuisance due to the sonic booms may be reduced to the point that overland supersonic flight may become a feasible option . a sonic boom does not occur only at the moment an object crosses the speed of sound ; and neither is it heard in all directions emanating from the supersonic object . rather the boom is a continuous effect that occurs while the object is travelling at supersonic speeds . but it affects only observers that are positioned at a point that intersects a region in the shape of a geometrical cone behind the object . as the object moves , this conical region also moves behind it and when the cone passes over the observer , they will briefly experience the boom .
