an electrical connector is an electromechanical device used to join electrical conductors and create an electrical circuit . most electrical connectors have a genderi.e . the male component , called a plug , connects to the female component , or socket . the connection may be removable ( as for portable equipment ) , require a tool for assembly and removal , or serve as a permanent electrical joint between two points . an adapter can be used to join dissimilar connectors . thousands of configurations of connectors are manufactured for power , data , and audiovisual applications . electrical connectors can be divided into four basic categories , differentiated by their function : inline or cable connectors permanently attached to a cable , so it can be plugged into another terminal ( either a stationary instrument or another cable ) chassis or panel connectors permanently attached to a piece of equipment so users can connect a cable to a stationary device pcb mount connectors soldered to a printed circuit board , providing a point for cable or wire attachment . ( e.g . pin headers , screw terminals , board-to-board connectors ) splice or butt connectors ( primarily insulation displacement connectors ) that permanently join two lengths of wire or cable in computing , electrical connectors are considered a physical interface and constitute part of the physical layer in the osi model of networking .
