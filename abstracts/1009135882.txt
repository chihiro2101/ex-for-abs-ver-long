an engineering drawing is a type of technical drawing that is used to convey information about an object . a common use is to specify the geometry necessary for the construction of a component and is called a detail drawing . usually , a number of drawings are necessary to completely specify even a simple component . the drawings are linked together by a master drawing or assembly drawing which gives the drawing numbers of the subsequent detailed components , quantities required , construction materials and possibly 3d images that can be used to locate individual items . although mostly consisting of pictographic representations , abbreviations and symbols are used for brevity and additional textual explanations may also be provided to convey the necessary information . the process of producing engineering drawings is often referred to as technical drawing or drafting ( draughting ) . drawings typically contain multiple views of a component , although additional scratch views may be added of details for further explanation . only the information that is a requirement is typically specified . key information such as dimensions is usually only specified in one place on a drawing , avoiding redundancy and the possibility of inconsistency . suitable tolerances are given for critical dimensions to allow the component to be manufactured and function . more detailed production drawings may be produced based on the information given in an engineering drawing . drawings have an information box or title block containing who drew the drawing , who approved it , units of dimensions , meaning of views , the title of the drawing and the drawing number .
