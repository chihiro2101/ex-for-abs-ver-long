glass fiber ( or glass fibre ) is a material consisting of numerous extremely fine fibers of glass . glassmakers throughout history have experimented with glass fibers , but mass manufacture of glass fiber was only made possible with the invention of finer machine tooling . in 1893 , edward drummond libbey exhibited a dress at the world 's columbian exposition incorporating glass fibers with the diameter and texture of silk fibers . glass fibers can also occur naturally , as pele 's hair . glass wool , which is one product called '' fiberglass '' today , was invented in 1932â€“1933 by games slayter of owens-illinois , as a material to be used as thermal building insulation . slayter patent for glass wool . application 1933 , granted 1938 . it is marketed under the trade name fiberglas , which has become a genericized trademark . glass fiber when used as a thermal insulating material , is specially manufactured with a bonding agent to trap many small air cells , resulting in the characteristically air-filled low-density '' glass wool '' family of products . glass fiber has roughly comparable mechanical properties to other fibers such as polymers and carbon fiber . although not as rigid as carbon fiber , it is much cheaper and significantly less brittle when used in composites . glass fibers are therefore used as a reinforcing agent for many polymer products ; to form a very strong and relatively lightweight fiber-reinforced plastic ( frp ) composite material called glass-reinforced plastic ( grp ) , also popularly known as '' fiberglass '' . unlike glass wool , grp contains little or no air or gas , is more dense , and thus is a poor thermal insulator compared to glass wool ; it is instead used structurally due to its strength and relatively low weight .
