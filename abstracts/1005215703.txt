a genetic chimerism or chimera ( /kaɪˈmɪərə/ or /kɪˈmɪərə/ , also spelled chimaera or chimæra ) is a single organism composed of cells with more than one distinct genotype . in animals , this means an individual derived from two or more zygotes , which can include possessing blood cells of different blood types , subtle variations in form ( phenotype ) and , if the zygotes were of differing sexes , then even the possession of both female and male sex organs ( this is just one of many different phenomena that may result in intersexuality ) . animal chimeras are produced by the merger of multiple fertilized eggs . in plant chimeras , however , the distinct types of tissue may originate from the same zygote , and the difference is often due to mutation during ordinary cell division . normally , genetic chimerism is not visible on casual inspection ; however , it has been detected in the course of proving parentage . another way that chimerism can occur in animals is by organ transplantation , giving one individual tissues that developed from a different genome . for example , transplantation of bone marrow often determines the recipient 's ensuing blood type .
