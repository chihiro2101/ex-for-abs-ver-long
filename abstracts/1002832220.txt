the magnificat ( latin for '' my soul magnifies the lord '' ) is a canticle , also known as the song of mary , the canticle of mary and , in the byzantine tradition , the ode of the theotokos . it is traditionally incorporated into the liturgical services of the catholic church and of the eastern orthodox churches . its name comes from the incipit of the latin version of the text . the text of the canticle is taken from the gospel of luke where it is spoken by mary upon the occasion of her visitation to her cousin elizabeth . in the narrative , after mary greets elizabeth , who is pregnant with john the baptist , the latter moves within elizabeth 's womb . elizabeth praises mary for her faith ( using words partially reflected in the hail mary ) , and mary responds with what is now known as the magnificat . the magnificat is one of the eight most ancient christian hymns and perhaps the earliest marian hymn . the history and use of hymns and hymn-tunes by david r breed 2009 page 17 favourite hymns by marjorie reeves 2006 page 3-5 within the whole of christianity , the canticle is most frequently recited within the liturgy of the hours . in western christianity , the magnificat is most often sung or recited during the main evening prayer service : vespers in the catholic and lutheran churches , and evening prayer ( or evensong ) in anglicanism . in eastern christianity , the magnificat is always sung at matins . the magnificat may also be sung during worship services , especially in the advent season during which these verses are traditionally read .
