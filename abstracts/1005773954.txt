rosetta began a descent with a 208-second thruster burn executed on 29 september 2016 at approximately 20:50 & nbsp ; utc . its trajectory targeted a site in the ma'at region near an area of dust- and gas-producing active pits . impact on the comet 's surface occurred 14.5 hours after its descent manoeuvre ; the final data packet from rosetta was transmitted at 10:39:28.895 & nbsp ; utc ( scet ) by the osiris instrument and was received at the european space operations centre in darmstadt , germany , at 11:19:36.541 & nbsp ; utc . note : times in the left column are spacecraft event time , while the right column is earth received time . all times are in utc . the spacecraft 's estimated speed at the time of impact was , and its touchdown location , named sais by the operations team after the rosetta stone 's original temple home , is believed to be only off-target . the final complete image transmitted by the spacecraft of the comet was taken by its osiris instrument at an altitude of about 10 seconds before impact , showing an area across . rosetta computer included commands to send it into safe mode upon detecting that it had hit the comet 's surface , turning off its radio transmitter and rendering it inert in accordance with international telecommunication union rules . on 28 september 2017 , a previously unrecovered image taken by the spacecraft was reported . this image was recovered from three data packets discovered on a server after completion of the mission . while blurry due to data loss , it shows an area of the comet 's surface approximately one square meter in size taken from an altitude of , and represents rosetta closest image of the surface .
