lens flare refers to a phenomenon wherein light is scattered or flared in a lens system , often in response to a bright light , producing a sometimes undesirable artifact within the image . this happens through light scattered by the imaging mechanism itself , for example through internal reflection and forward scatter from material imperfections in the lens . lenses with large numbers of elements such as zooms tend to exhibit greater lens flare , as they contain a relatively large number of interfaces at which internal scattering may occur . these mechanisms differ from the focused image generation mechanism , which depends on rays from the refraction of light from the subject itself . flare manifests itself in two ways : as visible artifacts and as glare across the image . the glare makes the image look '' washed out '' by reducing contrast and colorfulness ( adding light to dark image regions , and adding white to saturated regions , reducing their saturation ) . visible artifacts , usually in the shape of the aperture made by the iris diaphragm , are formed when light follows a pathway through the lens that contains one or more reflections from the lens surfaces . flare is particularly caused by very bright light sources . most commonly , this occurs when shooting toward the sun ( when the sun is in frame or the lens is pointed sunward ) , and is reduced by using a lens hood or other shade . for good-quality optical systems , and for most images ( which do not have a bright light shining into the lens ) , flare is a secondary effect that is widely distributed across the image and thus not visible , although it does reduce contrast .
