a sheepdog trial ( also herding event , stock dog trial or simply dog trial ) is a competitive dog sport in which herding dogs move sheep around a field , fences , gates , or enclosures as directed by their handlers . such events are particularly associated with hill farming areas , where sheep range widely on largely fence land . these trials take place in the united kingdom , ireland , south africa , chile , canada , the usa , australia , new zealand and other farming nations . some venues allow only dogs of known herding breeds to compete ; others allow any dog that has been trained to work stock .
