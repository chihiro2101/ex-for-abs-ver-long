theobald of bec ( c . 1090 & nbsp ; â€“ 18 & nbsp ; april 1161 ) was a norman archbishop of canterbury from 1139 to 1161 . his exact birth date is unknown . some time in the late 11th or early 12th century theobald became a monk at the abbey of bec , rising to the position of abbot in 1137 . king stephen of england chose him to be archbishop of canterbury in 1138 . canterbury 's claim to primacy over the welsh ecclesiastics was resolved during theobald 's term of office when pope eugene iii decided in 1148 in canterbury 's favour . theobald faced challenges to his authority from a subordinate bishop , henry of blois , bishop of winchester and king stephen 's younger brother , and his relationship with king stephen was turbulent . on one occasion stephen forbade him from attending a papal council , but theobald defied the king , which resulted in the confiscation of his property and temporary exile . theobald 's relations with his cathedral clergy and the monastic houses in his archdiocese were also difficult . serving during the disorders of stephen 's reign , theobald succeeded in forcing peace on the king by refusing to consecrate stephen 's son and heir , eustace . after eustace 's death in 1153 , stephen recognised his rival henry of anjou as his heir , and later theobald was named regent of the kingdom after stephen 's death . after a long illness , theobald died in 1161 , following which unsuccessful efforts were made to have him canonised as a saint . theobald was the patron of his successor thomas becket , and a number of other future bishops and archbishops served as his clerks . during his time as archbishop theobald augmented the rights of his see , or bishopric . historians of his time and later were divided on his character and he is often overlooked in the historical record , mainly because of the fame of his successor .
