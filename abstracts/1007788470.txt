image : nuremberg chronicles - omens ( clir ) . jpg thumb examples of omens from the nuremberg chronicle ( 1493 ) : natural phenomena and unnatural births . an omen ( also called portent or presage ) is a phenomenon that is believed to prediction , often signifying the advent of change . it was commonly believed in ancient times , and still believed by some today , that omens bring divine messages from the gods . these omens include natural phenomena , for example an eclipse , abnormal births of animals ( especially humans ) and behaviour of the sacrificial lamb on its way to the slaughter . they had specialists , the diviners , to interpret these omens . they would also use an artificial method , for example , a clay model of a sheep liver , to communicate with their gods in times of crisis . they would expect a binary answer , either yes or no answer , favourable or unfavourable . they did these to predict what would happen in the future and to take action to avoid disaster . though the word '' omen '' is usually devoid of reference to the change 's nature , hence being possibly either '' good '' or '' bad , '' the term is more often used in a foreboding sense , as with the word '' ominous '' . the origin of the word is unknown , although it may be connected with the latin word audire , meaning '' to hear .
