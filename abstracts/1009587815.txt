a hovercraft , also known as an air-cushion vehicle or acv , is an amphibious craft capable of travelling over land , water , mud , ice , and other surfaces . hovercraft use blowers to produce a large volume of air below the hull , or air cushion , that is slightly above atmospheric pressure . the pressure difference between the higher pressure air below the hull and lower pressure ambient air above it produces lift , which causes the hull to float above the running surface . for stability reasons , the air is typically blown through slots or holes around the outside of a disk- or oval-shaped platform , giving most hovercraft a characteristic rounded-rectangle shape . the first practical design for hovercraft was derived from a british invention in the 1950s to 1960s . they are now used throughout the world as specialised transports in disaster relief , coastguard , military and survey applications , as well as for sport or passenger service . very large versions have been used to transport hundreds of people and vehicles across the english channel , whilst others have military applications used to transport tanks , soldiers and large equipment in hostile environments and terrain . decline in public demand meant that as of 2018 , the only public hovercraft service in the world still in operation serves between the isle of wight and southsea in the uk . although now a generic term for the type of craft , the name hovercraft itself was a trademark owned by saunders-roe ( later british hovercraft corporation ( bhc ) , then westland ) , hence other manufacturers ' use of alternative names to describe the vehicles . the standard plural of hovercraft is hovercraft ( in the same manner that aircraft is both singular and plural ) .
