six of the eight classes contain only one or two genera each . polytrichopsida includes 23 genera , and bryopsida includes the majority of moss diversity with over 95 % of moss species belonging to this class . the sphagnopsida , the peat-mosses , comprise the two living genera ambuchanania and sphagnum , as well as fossil taxa . however , the genus sphagnum is a diverse , widespread , and economically important one . these large mosses form extensive acidic bogs in peat swamps . the leaves of sphagnum have large dead cells alternating with living photosynthetic cells . the dead cells help to store water . aside from this character , the unique branching , thallose ( flat and expanded ) protonema , and explosively rupturing sporangium place it apart from other mosses . andreaeopsida and andreaeobryopsida are distinguished by the biseriate ( two rows of cells ) rhizoids , multiseriate ( many rows of cells ) protonema , and sporangium that splits along longitudinal lines . most mosses have capsules that open at the top . polytrichopsida have leaves with sets of parallel lamellae , flaps of chloroplast-containing cells that look like the fins on a heat sink . these carry out photosynthesis and may help to conserve moisture by partially enclosing the gas exchange surfaces . the polytrichopsida differ from other mosses in other details of their development and anatomy too , and can also become larger than most other mosses , with e.g . , polytrichum commune forming cushions up to high . the tallest land moss , a member of the polytrichidae is probably dawsonia superba , a native to new zealand and other parts of australasia .
