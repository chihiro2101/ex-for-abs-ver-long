atwood goes on to describe her book as not a critique of religion , but a critique of the use of religion as a '' front for tyranny . '' yet others have argued that the handmaid 's tale critiques typical notions of feminism , as atwood 's novel appears to subvert the traditional '' women helping women '' ideals of the movement and turn toward the possibility of '' the matriarchy network . and a new form of misogyny : women 's hatred of women '' . scholars have analyzed and made connections to patriarchal oppression in the handmaid 's tale and oppression of women today . aisha matthews tackles the effects of institutional structures that oppress woman and womanhood and connects those to the themes present in the handmaid 's tale . she first asserts that structures and social frameworks , such as the patriarchy and societal role of traditional christian values , are inherently detrimental to the liberation of womanhood . she then makes the connection to the relationship between offred , serena joy , and their commander , explaining that through this '' perversion of traditional marriage , the biblical story of rachel , jacob , and bilhah is taken too literally .
