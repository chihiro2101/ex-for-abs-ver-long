while eliot was in europe , he was again presented with the opportunity to enter the world of active business . the merrimack company , one of the largest textile mills in the united states , tendered him an invitation to become its superintendent . in spite of the urgings of his friends and the attractiveness of what for the time was the enormous salary of 5000 ( plus a good house , rent free ) , eliot , after giving considerable thought to the offer , turned it down . one of his biographers speculated that he surely realized by this time that he had a strong taste for organizing and administration . this post would have given it scope . he must have felt , even if dimly , that if science interested him , it was not because he was first and last a lover of her laws and generalizations , not only because the clarity and precision of science was congenial , but because science answered the questions of practical men and conferred knowledge and power upon those who would perform the labors of their generation . during nearly two years in europe he had found himself as much fascinated by what he could learn concerning the methods by which science could be made to help industry as by what he discovered about the organization of institutions of learning . he was thinking much about what his own young country needed , and his hopes for the united states took account of industry and commerce as well as the field of academic endeavor . to be the chief executive officer of a particular business offered only a limited range of influence ; but to stand at the intersection of the realm of production and the realm of knowledge offered considerably more .
