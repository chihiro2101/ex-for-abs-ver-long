guttural speech sounds are those with a primary place of articulation near the back of the oral cavity . in some definitions , this is restricted to pharyngeal consonants , but in others includes some velar and uvular consonants . guttural sounds are typically consonants , but some vowels ' articulations may also be considered guttural in nature . although the term has historically been used by phoneticians , and is occasionally used by phonologists today , its technical use is now limited , and it is more common in popular use as an imprecise term for sounds produced relatively far back in the vocal tract . the term does , however , continue to be used by some phonologists to denote laryngeal consonants ( including uvulars ) , as well as murmured , pharyngealized , glottalized , and strident vowels .
