amlaíb mac sitric ( c . 927980 ; old norse : óláfr sigtryggsson ) , commonly called amlaíb cuarán , in old norse : óláfr kváran , was a 10th-century norse-gael who was king of northumbria and dublin . his byname , cuarán , is usually translated as '' sandal '' . his name appears in a variety of anglicized forms , including olaf cuaran and olaf sihtricson , particularly in relation to his short-lived rule in york . in old english he was anlaf . to irish speakers he may also have been amlaíb mac ua ímair or amlaíb ua ímair but others shared these names . likewise , his norse nickname , '' olaf the red '' was applied to several norse rulers in ireland and the isles . he was the last of the uí ímair to play a major part in the politics of the british isles . amlaíb was twice , perhaps three times , ruler of northumbria and twice ruler of dublin and its dependencies . his reign over these territories spanned some forty years . he was a renowned warrior and a ruthless pillager of churches , but ended his days in retirement at iona abbey . born when the uí ímair ruled over large areas of the british isles , by his death the kingdom of dublin was a minor power in irish politics . at the same time , dublin became a major centre of trade in atlantic europe and mastery over the city and its wealth became the supreme prize for ambitious irish kings . in death amlaíb was the prototype for the middle english romance character havelok the dane . in life he was a patron of irish poets and scandinavian skalds who wrote verses praising their paymaster . amlaíb was married at least twice , and had many children who married into irish and scandinavian royal families . his descendants were kings in the isle of man and the hebrides until the 13th century .
