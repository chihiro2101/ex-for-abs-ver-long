the carte du ciel ( literally , 'map of the sky ' ) and the astrographic catalogue ( or astrographic chart ) were two distinct but connected components of a massive international astronomical project , initiated in the late 19th century , to catalogue and map the positions of millions of stars as faint as 11th or 12th magnitude . twenty observatories from around the world participated in exposing and measuring more than 22,000 ( glass ) photographic plates in an enormous observing programme extending over several decades . despite , or because of , its vast scale , the project was only ever partially successful & ndash ; the carte du ciel component was never completed , and for almost half a century the astrographic catalogue part was largely ignored . however , the appearance of the hipparcos catalogue in 1997 has led to an important development in the use of this historical plate material .
