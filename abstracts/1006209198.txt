historically , jämtland and härjedalen belonged to norway until 1645 , and are thus often considered outside of the historical norrland . administratively , sweden is not divided into provinces but into counties ( län ) . although norrland is defined in terms of the historical provinces and not the counties , it roughly comprises the modern counties of gävleborg , jämtland , norrbotten , västerbotten and västernorrland . sometimes , norrland is subdivided into northern norrland ( norra norrland ) and southern norrland ( södra norrland ) . the northern part of the region typically covers the historical provinces of norrbotten , västerbotten and lappland ( the modern counties of norrbotten and västerbotten ) , while the southern part covers the remainder of the region .
