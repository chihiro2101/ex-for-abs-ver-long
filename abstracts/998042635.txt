in mathematics , division by zero is division where the divisor ( denominator ) is zero . such a division can be formally expressed as where a is the dividend ( numerator ) . in ordinary arithmetic , the expression has no meaning , as there is no number which , when multiplied by 0 , gives a ( assuming a & nbsp ; â‰  & nbsp ; 0 ) , and so division by zero is undefined . since any number multiplied by zero is zero , the expression is also undefined ; when it is the form of a limit , it is an indeterminate form . historically , one of the earliest recorded references to the mathematical impossibility of assigning a value to is contained in george berkeley 's criticism of infinitesimal calculus in 1734 in the analyst ( '' ghosts of departed quantities '' ) . . there are mathematical structures in which is defined for some a such as in the riemann sphere and the projectively extended real line ; however , such structures do not satisfy every ordinary rule of arithmetic ( the field axioms ) . in computer , a program error may result from an attempt to divide by zero . depending on the programming environment and the type of number ( e.g . floating point , integer ) being divided by zero , it may generate extended real number line by the ieee 754 floating point standard , generate an exception , generate an error message , cause the program to terminate , result in a special nan value , or a crash .
