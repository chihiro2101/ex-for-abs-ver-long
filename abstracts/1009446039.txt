a sex position is a position of the body that people use for sexual intercourse or other sexual activities . sexual acts are generally described by the positions the participants adopt in order to perform those acts . though sexual intercourse generally involves penetration of the body of one person by another , sex positions commonly involve penetrative or non-penetrative sexual activities . three categories of sexual intercourse are commonly practiced : vaginal intercourse ( involving vaginal penetration ) , anal sex , and oral sex ( especially mouth-on-genital stimulation ) . sex acts may also involve other forms of genital stimulation , such as solo or mutual masturbation , which may involve rubbing or penetration by fingering ( sexual act ) or by a device ( sex toy ) , such as a dildo or vibrator . the act may also involve anilingus . there are numerous sex positions that participants may adopt in any of these types of sexual intercourse or acts ; some authors have argued that the number of sex positions is essentially limitless .
