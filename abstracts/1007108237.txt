the cocoanut grove fire in boston , massachusetts , united states on november 28 , 1942 , was the deadliest nightclub fire in history , and second-deadliest single-building fire in american history , claiming 492 lives . the '' grove '' was one of boston 's most popular nightspots , attracting many celebrity visitors . it was owned by barnet '' barney '' welansky , closely connected to the mafia and to mayor maurice j . tobin . fire regulations had not been observed : some exit-doors had been locked to prevent unauthorised entry , and the elaborate palm-tree d√©cor contained flammable materials . the air-conditioning also used flammable gas , because freon was in short supply . as it was the first thanksgiving weekend of world war ii , the club was filled to more than twice its legal capacity . the fire started when a young couple removed a lightbulb for privacy , and a busboy was told to replace it , lighting a match to see better in the dimly-lit zone . although he had apparently extinguished the match , the draperies ignited and flames and smoke spread rapidly through all areas of the club . blame , however , was directed at welansky for violation of standards ; he served nearly four years in jail , before being released , only weeks from death . the local hospitals were especially well prepared to treat the casualties , as they had been rehearsing emergency drills in response to possible attacks on the east coast . the crisis demonstrated the value of the new blood banks , and it stimulated important advances in the treatment of burn victims . following the tragedy , many new fire-safety laws were enacted for public establishments , including the banning of flammable decorations and a provision that emergency exits must be kept open and that revolving doors can not be the sole egress outlet .
