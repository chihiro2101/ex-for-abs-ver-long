the basic laws of sweden are the four fundamental laws of the sweden that regulate the politics of sweden , acting in a similar manner to the constitutions of most countries . these are the instrument of government , the freedom of the press act , the fundamental law on freedom of expression and the act of succession . together , they constitute a basic framework that stands above other laws and regulation , and also define which agreements are themselves above normal swedish law . the parliament act is usually considered to be halfway between a fundamental law and a normal law , with certain main chapters afforded similar protections as the fundamental laws while other additional chapters require only a simple parliamentary majority . to amend or to revise a fundamental law , the riksdag needs to approve the changes twice in two successive terms with qualified majorities , with a general election having been held in between . the first vote can be replaced with a referendum . sweden is one of five countries ( new zealand , saudi arabia , israel and the uk ) that functions according to an uncodified constitution .
