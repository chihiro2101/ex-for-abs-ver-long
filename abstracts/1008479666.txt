the hurdy-gurdy is a string instrument that produces sound by a hand-crank-turned , rosined wheel rubbing against the strings . the wheel functions much like a violin bow , and single notes played on the instrument sound similar to those of a violin . melodies are played on a keyboard that presses tangents & mdash ; small wedges , typically made of wood & mdash ; against one or more of the strings to change their pitch . like most other acoustic stringed instruments , it has a sound board and hollow cavity to make the vibration of the strings audible . most hurdy-gurdies have multiple drone strings , which give a constant pitch accompaniment to the melody , resulting in a sound similar to that of bagpipes . for this reason , the hurdy-gurdy is often used interchangeably or along with bagpipes , particularly in occitan , aragon , cajun music and contemporary asturian , cantabric , galician , hungarian and slavic folk music . many folk music festivals in europe feature music groups with hurdy-gurdy players . the most famous has been held since 1976 at saint-chartier in the indre département in central france . in 2009 , it relocated nearby to the château d'ars at la châtre , where it continues to take place during the week nearest july 14 ( bastille day ) . la châtre 2016 retrieved 30 may 2016
