in music , a single is a type of release , typically a song recording of fewer tracks than an lp record or an album . this can be released for sale to the public in a variety of formats . in most cases , a single is a song that is released separately from an album , although it usually also appears on an album . typically , these are the songs from albums that are released separately for promotional uses such as music download , or video release . in other cases a recording released as a single may not appear on an album . despite being referred to as a single , in the era of music downloads , singles can include up to as many as three tracks . the biggest digital music distributor , itunes store , accepts as many as three tracks less than ten minutes each as a single . any more than three tracks on a musical release or thirty minutes in total running time is an extended play ( ep ) or , if over six tracks long , an album . historically , when mainstream music was purchased via vinyl records , singles would be released double-sided . that is , they were released with an a-side and b-side , on which two singles would be released , one on each side .
