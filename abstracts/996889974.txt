john smith ( 13 september 1938 – 12 may 1994 ) was a british labour politician who served as leader of the opposition and leader of the labour party from july 1992 until his death from a heart attack in may 1994 . smith first entered parliament in 1970 and , after junior ministerial roles as minister of state for energy ( 1975–1976 ) and minister of state for the privy council office ( 1976–1978 ) , he entered the cabinet towards the end of james callaghan 's tenure as prime minister , serving as secretary of state for business , innovation and skills ( 1978–1979 ) . during labour 's time in opposition to margaret thatcher conservative government , he rose through the shadow cabinet , serving as shadow secretary of state for trade ( 1979–1982 ) , shadow secretary of state for energy ( 1982–1983 ) , shadow secretary of state for employment ( 1983–1984 ) , shadow secretary of state for trade and industry ( 1984–1987 ) and shadow chancellor of the exchequer ( 1987–1992 ) . after labour leader neil kinnock resigned following the party 's surprise loss in the 1992 general election to new conservative leader john major , smith was elected his successor in july 1992 . he continued kinnock 's moves to reform labour , abolishing the trade union block vote at labour party conferences and replacing it with '' one member , one vote '' at the 1993 party conference . however , his overall cautious approach to reform , which was dubbed '' one more heave '' , sought to avoid controversy and win the next election by capitalising on the unpopularity of the conservative government . this frustrated many modernisers like tony blair and gordon brown and after smith 's sudden death in may 1994 , he was succeeded as leader by blair , who undertook the subsequent re-branding of labour as new labour , winning the 1997 general election in a landslide .
