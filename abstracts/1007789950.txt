the patricians ( from were originally a group of ruling class families in ancient rome . the distinction was highly significant in the roman kingdom , and the early republic , but its relevance waned after the conflict of the orders ( 494 bc to 287 bc ) . by the time of the late republic and empire , membership in the patriciate was of only nominal significance . the social structure of ancient rome revolved around the distinction between the patricians and the plebeians . the status of patricians gave them more political power than the plebeians . the relationship between the patricians and the plebeians eventually caused the conflict of the orders . this time period resulted in changing the social structure of ancient rome . after the western empire fell , the term '' patrician '' continued as a high honorary title in the byzantine empire . in the holy roman empire and in many italian city-states , medieval patrician classes were once again formally defined groups of leading grand burgher families , especially in venice and genoa . subsequently '' patrician '' became a vague term used to refer to aristocrats and the higher bourgeoisie in many countries . the legacy of the roman patrician and plebeian distinction lives on in modern society .
