in 1936 a constitutional crisis in the british empire arose when king-emperor edward viii proposed to marry wallis simpson , an american socialite who was divorced from her first husband and was pursuing the divorce of her second . the marriage was opposed by the governments of the united kingdom and the dominions of the british commonwealth . religious , legal , political , and moral objections were raised . as the british monarch , edward was the nominal head of the church of england , which did not allow divorced people to remarry in church if their ex-spouses were still alive . wallis 's first divorce ( in the united states on the grounds of '' emotional incompatibility '' ) was not recognised by the church of england and , if challenged in the english courts , might not have been recognised under english law . at that time , the church and english law considered adultery to be the only grounds for divorce . consequently , under this argument , her second marriage , as well as her marriage to edward , would be considered bigamous and invalid . bradford , p . 241 .
