there were only 752 convictions of police for mistreatment during these 10 years . pau perez , an advisor to the national mechanism for the prevention of torture notes that of the torture allegations made against police 50 % were from people belonging to social movements and 40 % were from immigrantsindicating these are the two groups who suffer most from police brutality . amnesty international and acodi ( acción contra la discriminación ) have both called out spain for racial profiling and ethnic discrimination . acodi documented 612 cases of racial discrimination in a single year , emphasising that many of these did not lead to official complaints because victims feared police retaliation or believed their complaints would be ignored . this belief is not unfounded ; in 2005 , beauty solomon , an african american immigrant working as a prostitute , filed two criminal complaints against spanish policemen for repeated harassment and physical assault . despite eyewitness testimony and medical reports confirming her injuries the spanish courts dismissed her claims on the grounds of insufficient evidence . solomon then took her case to the european court of human rights , who unanimously ruled in her favour that spain had violated article 3 ( prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment ) and article 14 ( prohibition of discrimination ) of the european convention of human rights . they also condemned spain for failing to investigate both solomon 's assault and other racist and sexist acts of violence by police officers . under spanish law , the police have the right to check the identity of anyone in a public space when there is a security concern . however , african and latin american immigrants are most frequently targeted , often without a legitimate security concern . '' people who do not 'look spanish ' can be stopped by police as often as four times a day , '' said izza leghtas , an amnesty international researcher .
