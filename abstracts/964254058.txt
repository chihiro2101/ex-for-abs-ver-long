grokster ltd . was a privately owned software company based in nevis , west indies that created the grokster peer-to-peer file-sharing client in 2001 that used the fasttrack protocol . grokster ltd . was rendered extinct in late 2005 by the united states supreme court 's decision in mgm studios , inc . v . grokster , ltd . the court ruled against grokster 's peer-to-peer file sharing program for computers running the microsoft windows operating system , effectively forcing the company to cease operations . the product was similar in look and feel to kazaa , marketed by sharman networks , and morpheus , which was distributed by streamcast . grokster , along with morpheus and kazaa , are considered second-generation peer-to-peer file sharing programs . unlike their predecessor napster , these file sharing programs allowed users to trade files directly between one another , without these transactions passing through a centralized server . because napster maintained this fraction of control over the transaction of files through its server , it was ruled illegal because it should have exercised its power over the server to stop the sharing of copyright infringing files . grokster and this second generation of peer-to-peer file sharing programs sought to avoid this legal obstacle .
