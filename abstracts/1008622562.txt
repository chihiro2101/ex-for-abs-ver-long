hurdling is the act of running and jumping over an obstacle at speed . the standard sprint or short hurdle race is 110 meters for men and 100 meters for women . the standard number of steps to the first hurdle should be 8 . the standard long hurdle race is 400 meters for both men and women . each of these races is run over ten hurdles and they are all olympic events . the men 's 200 meters low hurdles event was on the olympic athletics programme for the 1900 and 1904 summer olympics . these low hurdles events were widely participated in the early part of the 20th century , particularly in north america . however , beyond these two olympic outings , they never gained a consistent place at international competitions and became increasingly rare after the 1960s . this 10-hurdle race continues to be run in places such as norway . other distances are run , particularly indoors but occasionally outdoors . the sprint hurdle race indoors is usually 60 meters for both men and women , although races 55 meters or 50 meters long are sometimes run , especially in the united states . a 60-meter indoor race is run over 5 hurdles . a shorter race may occasionally have only 4 hurdles . outdoors , a long hurdle race is sometimes shortened to 300 meters for younger participants , who run over 8 hurdles . for example , high school and middle school athletes in california and pennsylvania run the 300 meter hurdles instead of running the 400 meter hurdles , like the majority of state competitors run today . the distance the hurdles are spaced is identical to the beginning of a standard 400 meter race which would have 10 hurdles . there are also 200 meter races for middle school and younger divisions over 5 hurdles ( spaced in the same position as the last 5 hurdles of a standard 400 meter race ) .
