jumping the shark is an idiom used to describe the moment of a misguided attempt at generating new publicity for something once , but no longer , widely popular ; the attempt serves instead to highlight the irrelevance of what it intends to promote . this is especially applicable to television series or other entertainment outlets . the phrase derives from a 1977 episode of the sitcom happy days ( 19741984 ) , in which the character fonzie jumps over a shark while on water-skis . this gimmick strayed absurdly outside the original storyline of the sitcom . the idiom '' jumping the shark '' is pejorative , most commonly used in reference to unsuccessful gimmicks for promoting something . it is similar to '' past its peak '' , but it more specifically suggests an unwillingness to acknowledge the fact . originally , the phrase was used to describe an episode of a television comedy with a gimmick or unlikely occurrence desperately attempting to keep viewers ' interest . moments labeled as '' jumping the shark '' are considered indications that writers have exhausted their focus , that the show has strayed irretrievably from an older and better formula , or that the series as a whole is declining in quality . the usage of '' jump the shark '' has subsequently broadened beyond television , indicating the moment when a brand , design , franchise , or creative effort 's evolution declines , or when it changes notably in style into something unwelcome .
