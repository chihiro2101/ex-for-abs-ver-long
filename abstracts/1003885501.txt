a corvette is a small warship . it is traditionally the smallest class of vessel considered to be a proper ( or '' rated '' ) warship . the warship class above the corvette is that of the frigate , while the class below was historically that of the sloop-of-war . the modern types of ship below a corvette are patrol vessel , missile boat and fast attack craft . in modern terms , a corvette is typically between 500 tons and 2,000 tons , although recent designs may approach 3,000 tons , which might instead be considered a small frigate . the word '' corvette '' is first found in middle french , a diminutive of the dutch word corf , meaning a '' basket '' , from the latin corbis . the rank '' corvette captain '' , equivalent in many navies to '' lieutenant commander '' , derives from the name of this type of ship . the rank is the most junior of three '' captain '' ranks in several european ( e.g . , france , spain , italy , croatia ) and south american ( e.g . , argentina , chile , brazil ) navies , because a corvette , as the smallest class of rated warship , was traditionally the smallest class of vessel entitled to a commander of a '' captain '' rank .
