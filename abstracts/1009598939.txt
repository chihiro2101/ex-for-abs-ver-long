the navagraha are said to be forces that capture or eclipse the mind and the decision making of human beings , thus the term graha . when the grahas are active in their daśās or periodicities they are said to be particularly empowered to direct the affairs of people and events . rahu and ketu correspond to the points where the moon crosses the ecliptic plane ( known as the ascending and descending nodes of the moon ) . classically known in indian and western astrology as the '' head and tail of the dragon '' , these planets are represented as a serpent-bodied demon beheaded by the sudarshan chakra of vishnu after attempting to swallow the sun . they are primarily used to calculate the dates of eclipses . they are described as '' shadow planets '' because they are not visible in the night sky . rahu has an orbital cycle of 18 years , ketu has an orbital cycle of 7 years and they are always retrograde in motion and 180 degrees from each other .
