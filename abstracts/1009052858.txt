abortion in ireland is regulated by the health ( regulation of termination of pregnancy ) act 2018 . abortion is permitted in ireland during the pregnancy first trimester , and later in cases where the pregnant woman 's life or health is at risk , or in the cases of a fatal foetal abnormality . abortion services commenced on 1 january 2019 following its legalisation by the aforementioned act , which became law on 20 december 2018 . this law followed a 36th constitutional amendment approved by a referendum in may 2018 , which replaced the 8th amendment which had given the life of the unborn foetus the same value as that of its mother with a clause permitting the oireachtas ( parliament ) to legislate for the termination of pregnancies . the constitutional amendment was signed into law on 18 september 2018 . abortion had been prohibited in ireland by the uk offences against the person act 1861 . the eighth amendment was added to the constitution by referendum in 1983 after concerns that laws prohibiting abortion could be found to be unconstitutional based on a right to privacy . in 1992 , the supreme court held in the x case that a thirteen-year-old girl who had become pregnant as a result of rape could be permitted to obtain an abortion in the state because there was a risk to her life from suicide . there were unsuccessful referendums in 1992 and in 2002 that aimed to further amend the constitution so as to preclude this part of the decision in future cases . between 1 january 2014 and 31 december 2018 , abortion in ireland was regulated by the protection of life during pregnancy act 2013 , under which abortion was illegal unless it occurred as the result of a medical intervention performed to save the life of the woman . irish abortion law received worldwide attention on the death of savita halappanavar in 2012 , who had been denied an abortion while suffering a septic miscarriage . this increased calls to repeal the eighth amendment . the constitutional and legislative provisions were discussed at a citizens ' assembly in 2016â€“17 , and at an oireachtas committee in 2017 , both of which recommended substantial reform and framed the debate of the referendum in may 2018 .
