metamathematics is the study of mathematics itself using mathematical methods . this study produces metatheory , which are mathematical theories about other mathematical theories . emphasis on metamathematics ( and perhaps the creation of the term itself ) owes itself to david hilbert 's attempt to secure the foundations of mathematics in the early part of the 20th century . metamathematics provides '' a rigorous mathematical technique for investigating a great variety of foundation problems for mathematics and logic '' ( kleene 1952 , p . & nbsp ; 59 ) . an important feature of metamathematics is its emphasis on differentiating between reasoning from inside a system and from outside a system . an informal illustration of this is categorizing the proposition '' 2+2 4 '' as belonging to mathematics while categorizing the proposition '' ' 2+2 4 ' is valid '' as belonging to metamathematics .
