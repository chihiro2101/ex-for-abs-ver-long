a radiosonde is a battery-powered telemetry instrument carried into the atmosphere usually by a weather balloon that measures various atmospheric sounding and transmits them by radio to a ground receiver . modern radiosondes measure or calculate the following variables : altitude , pressure , temperature , relative humidity , wind ( both wind speed and wind direction ) , cosmic ray readings at high altitude and geographical position ( latitude/longitude ) . radiosondes measuring ozone concentration are known as ozonesondes . radiosondes may operate at a radio frequency of 403 mhz or 1680 & nbsp ; mhz . a radiosonde whose position is tracked as it ascends to give wind speed and direction information is called a rawinsonde ( '' radar wind -sonde '' ) . most radiosondes have radar reflectors and are technically rawinsondes . a radiosonde that is dropped from an airplane and falls , rather than being carried by a balloon is called a dropsonde . radiosondes are an essential source of meteorological data , and hundreds are launched all over the world daily .
