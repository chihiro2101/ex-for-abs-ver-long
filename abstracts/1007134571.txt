image : topologist 's sine curve.svg thumb 420px the topologist 's sine curve , a useful example in point-set topology . it is connected but not path-connected . in mathematics , general topology is the branch of topology that deals with the basic set theory definitions and constructions used in topology . it is the foundation of most other branches of topology , including differential topology , geometric topology , and algebraic topology . another name for general topology is point-set topology . the fundamental concepts in point-set topology are continuity , compactness , and connectedness : continuous functions , intuitively , take nearby points to nearby points . compact sets are those that can be covered by finitely many sets of arbitrarily small size . connected sets are sets that can not be divided into two pieces that are far apart . the words 'nearby ' , 'arbitrarily small ' , and 'far apart ' can all be made precise by using the concept of open sets . if we change the definition of 'open set ' , we change what continuous functions , compact sets , and connected sets are . each choice of definition for 'open set ' is called a topology . a set with a topology is called a topological space . metric spaces are an important class of topological spaces where a real , non-negative distance , also called a metric , can be defined on pairs of points in the set . having a metric simplifies many proofs , and many of the most common topological spaces are metric spaces .
