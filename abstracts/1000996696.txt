in algebraic geometry , a calabi & ndash ; yau manifold , also known as a calabi & ndash ; yau space , is a particular type of manifold which has properties , such as ricci flatness , yielding applications in theoretical physics . particularly in superstring theory , the extra dimensions of spacetime are sometimes conjectured to take the form of a 6-dimensional calabi & ndash ; yau manifold , which led to the idea of mirror symmetry . their name was coined by , after who first conjectured that such surfaces might exist , and who proved the calabi conjecture . calabi & ndash ; yau manifolds are complex manifolds that are generalizations of k3 surfaces in any number of complex dimensions ( i.e . any even number of real dimensions ) . they were originally defined as compact k√§hler manifolds with a vanishing first chern class and a ricci-flat metric , though many other similar but inequivalent definitions are sometimes used .
