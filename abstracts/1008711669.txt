needlepoint is a type of canvas work , a form of counted thread embroidery in which yarn is stitched through a stiff even-weave . traditionally needlepoint designs completely cover the canvas . although needlepoint may be worked in a variety of stitches , many needlepoint designs use only a simple tent stitch and rely upon color changes in the yarn to construct the pattern . needlepoint is the oldest form of canvas work . the degree of detail in needlepoint depends on the thread count of the underlying mesh fabric . due to the inherent lack of suppleness of needlepoint , common uses include eyeglass cases , holiday ornaments , pillows , purses , upholstery , and wall hangings .
