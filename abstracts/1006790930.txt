in logic and mathematics , necessity and sufficiency are terms used to describe a conditional or implicational relationship between two statements . for example , in the conditional statement : '' if p then q '' , q is necessary for p , because the truth of p guarantees the truth of q ( equivalently , it is impossible to have p without q ) . similarly , p is sufficient for q , because p being true always implies that q is true , but p not being true does not always imply that q is not true . in general , a necessary condition is one which must be present in order for another condition to occur , while a sufficient condition is one which produces the said condition . the assertion that a statement is a '' necessary and sufficient '' condition of another means that the former statement is true if and only if the latter is true . that is , the two statements must be either simultaneously true , or simultaneously false . in ordinary english , '' necessary '' and '' sufficient '' indicate relations between conditions or states of affairs , not statements . for example , being a male is a necessary condition for being a brother , but it is not sufficientâ€”while being a male sibling is a necessary and sufficient condition for being a brother .
