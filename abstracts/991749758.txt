in molecular biology , molecular chaperones are proteins that assist the conformational folding or unfolding and the assembly or disassembly of other macromolecular structures . chaperones are present when the macromolecules perform their normal biological functions and have correctly completed the processes of folding and/or assembly . the chaperones are concerned primarily with protein folding . the first protein to be called a chaperone assists the assembly of nucleosomes from folded histones and dna and such assembly chaperones , especially in the nucleus , are concerned with the assembly of folded subunits into oligomeric structures . one major function of chaperones is to prevent both newly synthesised polypeptide chains and assembled subunits from aggregating into nonfunctional structures . it is for this reason that many chaperones , but by no means all , are heat shock proteins because the tendency to aggregate increases as proteins are denatured by stress . in this case , chaperones do not convey any additional steric information required for proteins to fold . however , some highly specific 'steric chaperones ' do convey unique structural ( steric ) information onto proteins , which can not be folded spontaneously . such proteins violate anfinsen 's dogma , requiring protein dynamics to fold correctly . various approaches have been applied to study the structure , dynamics and functioning of chaperones . bulk biochemical measurements have informed us on the protein folding efficiency , and prevention of aggregation when chaperones are present during protein folding . recent advances in single-molecule analysis chaperone action at the single-molecule level have brought insights into structural heterogeneity of chaperones , folding intermediates and affinity of chaperones for unstructured and structured protein chains .
