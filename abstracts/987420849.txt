the czochralski method , also czochralski technique or czochralski process , is a method of crystal growth used to obtain single crystals of semiconductors ( e.g . silicon , germanium and gallium arsenide ) , metals ( e.g . palladium , platinum , silver , gold ) , salts and synthetic gemstones . the method is named after polish scientist jan czochralski , paweł tomaszewski , '' jan czochralski i jego metoda . jan czochralski and his method '' ( in polish and english ) , oficyna wydawnicza atut , wrocław–kcynia 2003 , who invented the method in 1915 while investigating the crystallization rates of metals . j . czochralski ( 1918 ) '' ein neues verfahren zur messung der kristallisationsgeschwindigkeit der metalle '' a new method for the measurement of the crystallization rate of metals , zeitschrift für physikalische chemie , 92 : 219–221 . he made this discovery by accident : instead of dipping his pen into his inkwell , he dipped it in molten tin , and drew a tin filament , which later proved to be a single crystal . the most important application may be the growth of large cylindrical ingots , or boules , of single crystal silicon used in the electronics industry to make semiconductor devices like integrated circuits . other semiconductors , such as gallium arsenide , can also be grown by this method , although lower defect densities in this case can be obtained using variants of the bridgman–stockbarger method . the method is not limited to production of metal or metalloid crystals . for example , it is used to manufacture very high-purity crystals of salts , including material with controlled isotopic composition , for use in particle physics experiments , with tight controls ( part per billion measurements ) on confounding metal ions and water absorbed during manufacture .
