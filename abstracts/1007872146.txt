a ballistic missile submarine is a submarine capable of deploying submarine-launched ballistic missiles ( slbms ) with nuclear warheads . the united states navy 's hull classification symbols for ballistic missile submarines are ssb and ssbn â€“ the ss denotes submarine ( or submersible ship ) , the b denotes ballistic missile , and the n denotes that the submarine is nuclear powered . these submarines became a major weapon system in the cold war because of their deterrence theory capability . they can fire missiles thousands of kilometers from their targets , and acoustic quieting makes them difficult to detect ( see acoustic signature ) , thus making them a survivable deterrent in the event of a first strike and a key element of the mutual assured destruction policy of nuclear deterrence . the deployment of ssbns is dominated by the united states and russia ( following the collapse of the soviet union ) . smaller numbers are in service with france , the united kingdom , china , and india .
