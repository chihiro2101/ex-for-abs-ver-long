the balafon is a gourd-resonated xylophone , a type of struck idiophone . it is closely associated with the neighbouring mandé , senoufo and gur peoples of west africa , particularly the guinean branch of the mandinka ethnic group , but is now found across west africa from guinea to mali . its common name , balafon , is likely a european coinage combining its mandinka name bala with the word fôn 'to speak ' or the greek root phono .
