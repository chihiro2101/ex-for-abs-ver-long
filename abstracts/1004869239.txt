a spectral line is a dark or bright line in an otherwise uniform and continuous spectrum , resulting from emission or absorption of light in a narrow frequency range , compared with the nearby frequencies . spectral lines are often used to identify atoms and molecules . these '' fingerprints '' can be compared to the previously collected '' fingerprints '' of atoms and molecules , and are thus used to identify the atomic and molecular components of stars and planets , which would otherwise be impossible .
