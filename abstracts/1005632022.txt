fantômas is a fictional character created by french writers marcel allain ( 1885–1969 ) and pierre souvestre ( 1874–1914 ) . one of the most popular characters in the history of french crime fiction , fantômas was created in 1911 and appeared in a total of 32 volumes written by the two collaborators , then a subsequent 11 volumes written by allain alone after souvestre 's death . the character was also the basis of various film , television , and comic book adaptations . in the history of crime fiction , he represents a transition from gothic novel villains of the 19th century to modern-day serial killers . the books and movies that came out in quick succession anticipate current production methods of hollywood , in two respects : first , the authors distributed the writing among themselves ; their '' working method was to draw up the general plot between them and then go off and write alternate chapters independently of each other , meeting up to tie the two halves of the story together in the final chapter . '' this approach allowed the authors to produce almost one novel per month . second , the movie rights to the books were immediately snapped up . such a system ensured that the film studio could produce sequels reliably . the popular depiction of fantômas as wearing a blue mask , black gloves , and using technological devices did not originate in the novels , but is a result of the popularity of the trilogy of fantômas movies directed by andré hunebelle in the 1960s . the trilogy , which started in 1964 with fantômas , departed considerably from the novels by giving the story a more comedic tone as preceded by the first two pink panther films , and by making fantômas ( played by jean marais ) more of a james bond enemy by likewise borrowing from the first two bond films . despite these discrepancies , the blue-masked fantômas is arguably the one that is most easily remembered .
