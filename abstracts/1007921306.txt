an apostrophe ( ʼ ) is used to mark ejective consonants ( e.g . chʼ , tłʼ ) as well as mid-word or final glottal stops . however , initial glottal stops are usually not marked . the voiceless glottal fricative is normally written as h , but appears as x after the consonants s , z , and digraphs ending in h to avoid phonological ambiguity . the voiced velar fricative is written as y before i and e ( where it is palatalized , as w before o ( where it is labialized , and as gh before a . navajo represents nasalized vowels with an ogonek ( ˛ ) , sometimes described as a reverse cedilla ; and represents the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative with a barred l ( capital ł , lowercase ł ) . the ogonek is placed centrally under a vowel , but it was imported from polish and lithuanian , which do not use it under certain vowels such as o or any vowels with accent marks . for example , in proper navajo writing , the ogonek below lowercase a is written centered below the letter , whereas fonts for a with ogonek intended for polish and lithuanian such as those used in common web browsers render the ogonek connected to the bottom right of the letter . no unicode font has been developed to properly accommodate navajo typography . google is working to correct this oversight with noto fonts . the first navajo-capable typewriter was developed in preparation for a navajo newspaper and dictionary created in the 1940s . the advent of early computers in the 1960s necessitated special fonts to input navajo text , and the first navajo font was created in the 1970s . navajo virtual keyboards were made available for ios devices in november 2012 and android devices in august 2013 .
