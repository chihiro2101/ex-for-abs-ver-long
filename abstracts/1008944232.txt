a table of inductance for short solenoids of various diameter to length ratios has been calculated by dellinger , whittmore , and ould . this , and the inductance of more complicated shapes , can be derived from maxwell 's equations . for rigid air-core coils , inductance is a function of coil geometry and number of turns , and is independent of current . similar analysis applies to a solenoid with a magnetic core , but only if the length of the coil is much greater than the product of the relative permeability of the magnetic core and the diameter . that limits the simple analysis to low-permeability cores , or extremely long thin solenoids . the presence of a core can be taken into account in the above equations by replacing the magnetic constant μ 0 with μ or μ 0 μ r , where μ represents permeability and μ r relative permeability . note that since the permeability of ferromagnetic materials changes with applied magnetic flux , the inductance of a coil with a ferromagnetic core will generally vary with current .
