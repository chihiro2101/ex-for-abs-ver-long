thumb the battle of salamanca ( in french and spanish known as the battle of arapiles ) on 22july 1812 was a battle in which an anglo-portuguese army under the duke of wellington defeated marshal auguste marmont 's french forces at arapiles , south of salamanca , spain , during the peninsular war . a spanish division was also present but took no part in the battle . the battle involved a succession of flanking maneuver in oblique order , initiated by the british heavy cavalry brigade and pakenham 's 3rd division and continued by the cavalry and the 4th , 5th and 6th divisions . these attacks resulted in a rout of the french left wing . marmont and his deputy commander , general bonet , received shrapnel wounds in the first few minutes of firing . confusion amongst the french command may have been decisive in creating an opportunity , which wellington seized . general bertrand clausel , third in seniority , assumed command and ordered a counter-attack by the french reserve toward the depleted allied centre . the move proved partly successful but with wellington having sent his reinforcements to the centre , the anglo-portuguese forces prevailed . allied losses numbered 3,129 british and 2,038 portuguese dead or wounded . the spanish troops took no part in the battle as they were positioned to block french escape routes and suffered just six casualties . the french suffered about 13,000 dead , wounded and captured . as a consequence of wellington 's victory , his army was able to advance to and liberate madrid for two months , before retreating to portugal . the french were forced to abandon andalusia permanently while the loss of madrid irreparably damaged king joseph 's afrancesado .
