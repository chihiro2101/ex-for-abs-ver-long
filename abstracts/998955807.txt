thumb thumb spherical geometry is the geometry of the two-dimensional surface of a sphere . in this context the word '' sphere '' refers only to the 2-dimensional surface and other terms like '' ball '' or '' solid sphere '' are used for the surface together with its 3-dimensional interior . long studied for its practical applications to navigation and astronomy , spherical geometry bears many similarities and relationships to , and important differences from , euclidean plane geometry . the sphere has for the most part been studied as a part of 3-dimensional euclidean geometry ( often called solid geometry ) , the surface thought of as placed inside an ambient 3-d space . it can also be analyzed by '' intrinsic '' methods that only involve the surface itself , and do not refer to , or even assume the existence of , any surrounding space outside or inside the sphere . because a sphere and a plane differ geometrically , ( intrinsic ) spherical geometry has some features of a non-euclidean geometry and is sometimes described as being one . however , spherical geometry was not considered a full-fledged non-euclidean geometry sufficient to resolve the ancient problem of whether the parallel postulate is a logical consequence of the rest of euclid 's axioms of plane geometry . the solution was found instead in hyperbolic geometry .
