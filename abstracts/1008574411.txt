a woofer or bass speaker is a technical term for a loudspeaker driver designed to produce bass ( sound ) sounds , typically from 50 hz up to 1000 hz . the name is from the onomatopoeia english word for a dog 's bark , '' woof '' ( in contrast to the name used for loudspeakers designed to reproduce high-frequency sounds , tweeter ) . the most common design for a woofer is the electrodynamic driver , which typically uses a stiff paper cone , driven by a voice coil surrounded by a magnetic field . the voice coil is attached by adhesives to the back of the loudspeaker cone . the voice coil and the magnet form a linear electric motor . when current flows through the voice coil , the coil moves in relation to the frame according to fleming 's left hand rule for motors , causing the coil to push or pull on the driver cone in a piston-like way . the resulting motion of the cone creates sound waves , as it moves in and out . at ordinary sound pressure levels ( spl ) , most humans can hear down to about 20 & nbsp ; hz . woofers are generally used to cover the lowest octaves of a loudspeaker 's frequency range . in two-way loudspeaker systems , the drivers handling the lower frequencies are also obliged to cover a substantial part of the midrange , often as high as 2000 to 5000 & nbsp ; hz ; such drivers are commonly termed mid woofers . since the 1990s , a type of woofer ( termed subwoofer ) , which is designed for very low frequencies only , has come to be commonly used in home cinema systems and pa systems to augment the bass response ; they usually handle the very lowest two or three octaves ( i.e . , from as low as 20 to 80 or 120 & nbsp ; hz ) .
