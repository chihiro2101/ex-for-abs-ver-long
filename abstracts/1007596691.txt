common law marriage , also known as non-ceremonial marriage , marriage , informal marriage , or marriage by habit and repute , is a legal framework where a couple may be considered married without having formally registered their relation as a civil or religion marriage . the original concept of a '' common-law marriage '' is one considered valid by both partners but not formally recorded with a state or religious registry , nor celebrated in a formal civil or religious service . in effect , the act of the couple representing themselves to others as being married and organizing their relation as if they were married , means they are married . the term common-law marriage ( or similar ) has wider informal use , often to denote relations that are not legally recognized as marriages . it is often used colloquially or by the media to refer to cohabitation , regardless of any legal rights or religious implications involved . this can create confusion in regard to the term and to the legal rights of unmarried partners ( in addition to the actual status of the couple referred to ) .
