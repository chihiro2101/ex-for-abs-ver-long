as a child star , coogan earned an estimated 3 to 4 million ( 44 to 59 million in 2020 dollars ) . when he turned 21 in october 1935 , his fortune was believed to be well intact . his assets had been conservatively managed by his father , who had died in the car accident five months earlier . however , coogan found that the entire amount had been spent by his mother and stepfather , arthur bernstein , on fur coats , diamonds and other jewelry , and expensive cars . bernstein had been a financial advisor for the family and married coogan 's mother in late 1936 . coogan 's mother and stepfather claimed jackie enjoyed himself and simply thought he was playing before the camera . she insisted , '' no promises were ever made to give jackie anything '' , and claimed he '' was a bad boy '' . coogan sued them in 1938 , but after his legal expenses , he received just 126,000 of the 250,000 remaining of his earnings . when he fell on hard times and asked charlie chaplin for assistance , chaplin handed him 1,000 without hesitating . the legal battle focused attention on child actors and resulted in the 1939 enactment of the california child actor 's bill , often referred to as the '' coogan law '' or the '' coogan act '' . it required that a child actor 's employer set aside 15 % of the earnings in a trust ( called a coogan account ) , and specified the actor 's schooling , work hours , and time off .
