a critical mass is the smallest amount of fissile material needed for a sustained nuclear chain reaction . the critical mass of a fissionable material depends upon its nuclear properties ( specifically , its nuclear fission cross-section ) , density , shape , enrichment , purity , temperature , and surroundings . the concept is important in nuclear weapon design .
