the dormant commerce clause , or negative commerce clause , in american constitutional law , is a legal doctrine that courts in the united states have inferred from the commerce clause in article i of the us constitution . williams , norman . '' why congress may not overrule the dormant commerce clause '' , 53 ucla l . rev . 153 ( 2005 ) . the primary focus of the doctrine is barring state protectionism . the dormant commerce clause is used to prohibit state legislation that discriminates against interstate or international commerce . courts first determine whether a state regulation discriminates on its face against interstate commerce or whether it has the purpose or effect of discriminating against interstate commerce . for example , it is lawful for michigan to require food labels that specifically identify certain animal parts , if they are present in the product , because the state law applies to food produced in michigan as well as food imported from other states and foreign countries ; the state law would violate the commerce clause if it applied only to imported food or if it was otherwise found to favor domestic over imported products . likewise , california law requires milk sold to contain a certain percentage of milk solids that federal law does not require , which is allowed under the dormant commerce clause doctrine because california 's stricter requirements apply equally to california-produced milk and imported milk and so does not discriminate against or inappropriately burden interstate commerce . california department of food and agriculture â€“ milk standards '' the doctrine was initially envisioned by chief justice john marshall in the 1820s .
