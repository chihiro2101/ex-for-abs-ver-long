htms chakri naruebet ( cvh-911 ) , meaning 'sovereign of the chakri dynasty ' , the thai monarchy 's ruling family ) is the flagship of the royal thai navy ( rtn ) , and thailand 's first and only aircraft carrier , although the rtn refers to her as an '' offshore patrol helicopter carrier '' . pike ( ed . ) , chakri naruebet chakri naruebet , thailand , naval-technology.com based on the spanish navy 's design and constructed by spanish shipbuilder baz√°n , chakri naruebet was ordered in 1992 , laid down in 1994 , launched in 1996 , and commissioned into the rtn in 1997 . the ship is the smallest functioning aircraft carrier in the world . the aircraft carrier was designed to operate an air group of v/stol fighter aircraft and helicopters , and is fitted with an aircraft ski-jump . initial intentions were to operate a mixed air group of ex-spanish av-8s matador aircraft and sikorsky sh-60 seahawk helicopters . however , by 1999 it was reported that only one matador was operational due to parts , training , and fiscal limitations , although three matadors were spotted on the ship during a show of force after the 29 january 2003 phnom penh riots in cambodia . her entire harrier v/stol jet fleet was removed from service in 2006 . although chakri naruebet was intended for patrols and force projection in thai waters , a lack of funding brought on by the 1997 asian financial crisis meant the carrier has spent most of her career docked at the sattahip naval base . chakri naruebet has been deployed on several disaster relief operations , including in the aftermath of the 2004 indian ocean earthquake and tsunami , and in response to separate flooding incidents in late-2010 and early-2011 . other than disaster relief , the carrier 's few other departures from port are for a single training day per month , and transportation of the royal family of thailand , leading to claims by some naval commentators that the ship is merely an oversized royal yacht .
