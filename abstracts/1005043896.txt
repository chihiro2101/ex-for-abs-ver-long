analog recording is a technique used for the recording of analog signals which , among many possibilities , allows analog audio for later playback . analog audio recording began with mechanical systems such as the phonautograph and phonograph . later , electronic techniques such as wire and tape recorder were developed . analog recording methods store analog signals directly in or on the media . the signal may be stored as a physical texture on a phonograph record , or a fluctuation in the field strength of a magnetic recording . this is different from digital recording where an analog signal is sampled and quantized to produce a digital signal which is represented and stored as discrete numbers .
