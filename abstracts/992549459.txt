forging is a manufacturing process involving the shaping of metal using localized compressive forces . the blows are delivered with a hammer ( often a power hammer ) or a die . forging is often classified according to the temperature at which it is performed : cold forging ( a type of cold working ) , warm forging , or hot forging ( a type of hot working ) . for the latter two , the metal is heated , usually in a forge . forged parts can range in weight from less than a kilogram to hundreds of metric tons . degarmo , p . 389 forging has been done by smiths for millennia ; the traditional products were kitchenware , hardware , hand tools , edged weapons , cymbals , and jewellery . since the industrial revolution , forged parts are widely used in mechanisms and machines wherever a component requires high strength ; such forgings usually require further processing ( such as machining ) to achieve a finished part . today , forging is a major worldwide industry .
