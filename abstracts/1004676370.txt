a recumbent bicycle is a bicycle that places the rider in a laid-back reclining position . most recumbent riders choose this type of design for ergonomic reasons : the rider 's weight is distributed comfortably over a larger area , supported by back and buttocks . on a traditional upright bicycle , the body weight rests entirely on a small portion of the sitting bones , the feet , and the hands . most recumbent models also have an aerodynamic advantage ; the reclined , legs-forward position of the rider 's body presents a smaller frontal profile . a recumbent holds the world speed record for a bicycle , and they were banned from racing under the union cycliste internationale ( uci ) in 1934 , and now race under the banner of the world human powered vehicle association ( whpva ) and international human powered vehicle association ( ihpva ) . recumbents are available in a wide range of configurations , including : long to short wheelbase ; large , small , or a mix of wheel sizes ; overseat , underseat , or no-hands steering ; and rear wheel or front wheel drive . a variant with three wheels is a recumbent tricycle .
