a canterbury tale is a 1944 british film by powell and pressburger starring eric portman , sheila sim , dennis price and sgt . john sweet ; esmond knight provided narration and played two small roles . for the post-war american release , raymond massey narrated and kim hunter was added to the film . the film was made in black and white , and was the first of two collaborations between powell and pressburger and cinematographer erwin hillier . much of the film 's visual style is a mixture of british realism and hillier 's german expressionism style that is harnessed through a neo-romantic sense of the english landscape . the concept that 'the past always haunts the present ' in the english landscape was already part of english literary culture , e.g . in works by rudyard kipling such as puck of pook 's hill , and would become a notable trope for british novelists and film-makers from the 1960s . a canterbury tale takes its title from the canterbury tales of geoffrey chaucer and loosely uses chaucer 's theme of '' eccentric characters on a religious pilgrimage '' to highlight the wartime experiences of the citizens of kent and encourage wartime anglo-american friendship and understanding . anglo-american relations were also explored in powell and pressburger 's previous film the life and death of colonel blimp and in more detail in their subsequent film a matter of life and death .
