an ecotax ( short for ecological taxation ) is a tax levied on activities which are considered to be harmful to the environment and is intended to promote environmentally friendly activities via economic incentives . such a policy can complement or avert the need for regulatory ( command and control ) approaches . often , an ecotax policy proposal may attempt to maintain overall tax revenue by proportionately reducing other taxes ( e.g . taxes on human labor and renewable resources ) ; such proposals are known as a green tax shift towards ecological taxation . ecotaxes address the failure of free markets to consider environmental impacts . ecotaxes are examples of pigouvian taxes , which are taxes that attempt to make the private parties involved feel the social burden of their actions . an example might be philosopher thomas pogge 's proposed global resources dividend .
