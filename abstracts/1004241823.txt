a spaceport or cosmodrome is a site for launching ( or receiving ) spacecraft , by analogy to seaport for ships or airport for aircraft . the word spaceport , and even more so cosmodrome , has traditionally been used for sites capable of launching spacecraft into orbit around earth or on interplanetary trajectories . however , rocket launch sites for purely sub-orbital flights are sometimes called spaceports , as in recent years new and proposed sites for suborbital human flights have been frequently referred to or named 'spaceports ' . space stations and proposed future bases on the moon are sometimes called spaceports , in particular if intended as a base for further journeys . the term rocket launch site is used for any facility from which rockets are launched . it may contain one or more launch pads or suitable sites to mount a transportable launch pad . it is typically surrounded by a large safety area , often called a rocket range or missile range . the range includes the area over which launched rockets are expected to fly , and within which some components of the rockets may land . tracking stations are sometimes located in the range to assess the progress of the launches . merritt island spaceflight tracking and data network station major spaceports often include more than one launch complex , which can be rocket launch sites adapted for different types of launch vehicles . ( these sites can be well-separated for safety reasons . ) for launch vehicles with liquid propellant , suitable storage facilities and , in some cases , production facilities are necessary . on-site processing facilities for solid propellants are also common . a spaceport may also include runways for takeoff and landing of aircraft to support spaceport operations , or to enable support of hthl or htvl winged launch vehicles .
