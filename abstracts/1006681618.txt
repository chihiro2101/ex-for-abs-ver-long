sumner is a coastal seaside suburb of christchurch , new zealand and was surveyed and named in 1849 in honour of john bird sumner , the then newly appointed archbishop of canterbury and president of the canterbury association . originally a separate borough , it was amalgamated with the city of christchurch as communications improved and the economies of scale made small town boroughs uneconomic to operate .
