santa clara county v . southern pacific railroad company , 118 u.s . 394 ( 1886 ) , is a corporate law case of the united states supreme court concerning taxation of railroad properties . the case is most notable for a headnote stating that the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment grants constitutional protections to corporations . the case arose when several railroads refused to follow a california state law that gave less favorable tax treatment to some assets owned by corporations as compared to assets owned by individuals . the court 's opinions in earlier cases such as dartmouth college v . woodward had recognized that corporations were entitled to some of the protections of the constitution . associate justice john marshall harlan 's majority opinion held for the railroads , but his opinion did not address the equal protection clause . however , a headnote written by the reporter of decisions and approved by chief justice morrison waite stated that the supreme court justices unanimously believed that the equal protection clause did grant constitutional protections to corporations . the headnote marked the first occasion on which the supreme court indicated that the equal protection clause granted constitutional protections to corporations as well as to natural persons .
