the irish oath of allegiance was a controversial provision in the anglo-irish treaty of 1921 , which irish tds ( members of the lower house of the irish parliament ) and senators were required to swear before taking their seats in dáil éireann ( chamber of deputies ) and seanad éireann ( irish senate ) before the constitution ( removal of oath ) act 1933 was passed on 3 may 1933 . the controversy surrounding the oath was one of the principal issues that led to the irish civil war of 1922–23 between supporters and opponents of the treaty .
