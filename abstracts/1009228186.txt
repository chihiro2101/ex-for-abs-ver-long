television wales and the west ident ( transdiffusion broadcasting system / electromusications ) , accessed 19 august 2006 royal television society , accessed 19 august 2006 ( tww ) was the british itv ( tv network ) ( commercial television ) contractor for the franchise area serving south wales and west of england ( franchise awarded 26 october 1956 , started transmissions on 14 january 1958 , the eighth franchise to launch ) until 1968 . for the first six years , tww 's service was provided from a single vhf transmitter serving both south east wales and the west of england . the later acquisition of teledu cymru in 1964 enabled tww to extend its coverage across most of wales and to provide separate services for the welsh and english parts of the resulting 'dual region ' franchise . after losing their franchise to harlech , tww ended their service early in protest long before harlech was ready to take over . this forced the independent television authority to organise an emergency transitional service run by harlech but using tww 's staff , leftover programming , and some assets .
