at the time of construction , norwood tunnel was the second longest canal tunnel in britain , exceeded only by another of brindley 's tunnels , that at harecastle on the trent and mersey canal . the canal was a typical brindley contour canal , following the contours to avoid costly cuttings and embankments , which resulted in a less than direct route in places . in late 1775 , the company had decided to build a branch , which left the canal between renishaw and staveley , and ran generally southwards for about to the turnpike road at norbriggs . this may have been to help with transport to chesterfield , until the main line was completed , but in 1777 , the company leased norbriggs colliery . henshall supervised its operation , and transport of coal to the branch canal was improved by the provision of a '' newcastle rail road '' in 1778 , which used wooden rails . the company pulled out of running the mine in 1797 , when they advertised it to be let . water supply was initially by a reservoir at pebley , which was later supplemented by reservoirs at harthill , woodall and killamarsh . near worksop , a private branch was built to serve the lady lee quarry , which ran for about , while at netherthorpe , a branch connected to the east inkersall tramroad , which served pits near the adelphi canal . a gasworks was later built at the junction , and while the 1877 ordnance survey map shows a short stub of the branch , connecting to the seymour and speedwell branch railway , by 1898 a railway siding had replaced it , leaving just a basin at the junction to serve the gasworks . ordnance survey , 1:2,500 map , 1877 and 1898 another private branch was built in 1840 , which crossed the norbriggs road at netherthorpe to serve the speedwell colliery . it was built by the barrows , who also owned staveley ironworks , but by 1860 had been replaced by a railway . by 1789 , the company had spent a total of £152,400 , raised through shares and by mortgages . income for the year was £8,320 , and after interest payments had been met , that left a net profit of £2,780 , enabling them to make their first dividend payment of one per cent . 74,312 tons of traffic were carried that year , of which 42,380 tons were coal , with the rest consisting of lead , iron , stone , corn , lime , timber and sundries . dividends had risen to five per cent by 1795 , were eight per cent the following year , and were six or seven percent until at least 1836 . there were several suggestions for links to the river don navigation or the sheffield canal , the first in 1792 as part of the scheme to build a canal to sheffield , and subsequently in 1824 , as part of the grand commercial canal , and in 1852 , when a sheffield and chesterfield junction canal was proposed , but none of them moved past the planning stage .
