the first law of thermodynamics is a version of the law of conservation of energy , adapted for thermodynamic processes , distinguishing two kinds of transfer of energy , as heat and as thermodynamic work , and relating them to a function of a body 's state , called internal energy . the law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant ; energy can be transformed from one form to another , but can be neither created nor destroyed . for a thermodynamic process without transfer of matter , the first law is often formulated the sign convention ( q is heat supplied to the system but w is work done by the system ) is that of rudolf clausius , and it will be followed below . : \delta u q - w , where denotes the change in the internal energy of a closed system , denotes the quantity of energy supplied to the system as heat , and denotes the amount of thermodynamic work done by the system on its surroundings . an equivalent statement is that perpetual motion machines of the first kind are impossible . for processes that include transfer of matter , a further statement is needed : 'with due account of the respective reference states of the systems , when two systems , which may be of different chemical compositions , initially separated only by an impermeable wall , and otherwise isolated , are combined into a new system by the thermodynamic operation of removal of the wall , then : u_0 u_1 + u_2 , where denotes the internal energy of the combined system , and and denote the internal energies of the respective separated systems .
