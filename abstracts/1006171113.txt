harz national park is a nature reserve in the german federal states of lower saxony and saxony-anhalt . it comprises portions of the western harz mountain range , extending from herzberg and bad lauterberg at the southern edge to bad harzburg and ilsenburg on the northern slopes . 95 % of the area is covered with forests , mainly with spruce and beech woods , including several bogs , granite rocks and creeks . the park is part of the natura 2000 network of the european union . in its current form , the park was created on january 1 , 2006 by the merger of the harz national park in lower saxony , established in 1994 , and the upper harz national park in saxony-anhalt , established in 1990 . as the former inner german border ran through the harz , large parts of the range were prohibited areas , that apart from the fortifications had remained completely unaffected for decades . today the park covers parts of the districts of goslar , g√∂ttingen and harz . rare animals of the harz national park include the white-throated dipper , the black stork , peregrine falcon , the european wildcat and especially the eurasian lynx . the last lynx in the harz mountains had been shot in 1818 , but in 1999 a project for reintroducing was established . since 2002 several wild lynxes gave birth . an attempt to return the capercaillie ( auerhuhn ) however did not succeed .
