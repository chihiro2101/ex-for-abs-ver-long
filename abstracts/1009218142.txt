bogomilism ( bulgarian and ; / богумилство ) was a christian gnosticism or dualist sect founded in the first bulgarian empire by the priest bogomil during the reign of tsar peter i in the 10th century . it most probably arose in what is today the macedonia ( region ) . the bogomils called for a return to what they considered to be early spiritual teaching , rejecting the ecclesiology , and their primary political tendencies were resistance to the state and church authorities . this helped the movement spread quickly in the balkans , gradually expanding throughout the byzantine empire and later reaching kievan rus ' , bosnia ( bosnian church ) , dalmatia , serbia , italy , and france ( cathars ) . the bogomils were dualists or gnostics in that they believed in a world within the body and a world outside the body . they did not use the christian cross , nor build churches , as they revered their gifted form and considered their body to be the temple . this gave rise to many forms of practice to cleanse oneself through purging , fasting , celebrating and dancing .
