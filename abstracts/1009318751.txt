the efficient-market hypothesis ( emh ) is a hypothesis in financial economics that states that asset prices reflect all available information . a direct implication is that it is impossible to '' beat the market '' consistently on a risk-adjusted basis since market prices should only react to new information . because the emh is formulated in terms of risk adjustment , it only makes testable predictions when coupled with a particular model of risk . as a result , research in financial economics since at least the 1990s has focused on market anomaly , that is , deviations from specific models of risk . the idea that financial market returns are difficult to predict goes back to bachelier ( 1900 ) , mandelbrot ( 1963 ) , and samuelson ( 1965 ) , but is closely associated with eugene fama , in part due to his influential 1970 review of the theoretical and empirical research ( fama 1970 ) . the emh provides the basic logic for modern risk-based theories of asset prices , and frameworks such as consumption-based asset pricing and intermediary asset pricing can be thought of as the combination of a model of risk with the emh .
