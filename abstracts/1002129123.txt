opendoc is a defunct multi-platform software componentry framework standard created by apple in the 1990s for compound documents , intended as an alternative to microsoft 's object linking and embedding ( ole ) . as part of the aim alliance between apple , ibm , and motorola , opendoc is one of apple 's earliest experiments with open standards and collaborative development methods with other companieseffectively starting an industry consortium . active development was discontinued in march 1997 . the core idea of opendoc is to create small , reusable components , responsible for a specific task , such as text editing , bitmap editing , or browsing an ftp server . opendoc provides a framework in which these components can run together , and a document format for storing the data created by each component . these documents can then be opened on other machines , where the opendoc frameworks substitute suitable components for each part , even if they are from different vendors . in this way users can '' build up '' their documents from parts . since there is no main application and the only visible interface is the document itself , the system is known as document-centered . at its inception , it was envisioned that opendoc would allow , for example , smaller , third-party developers to enter the then-competitive office suite software market , able to build one good editor instead of having to provide a complete suite .
