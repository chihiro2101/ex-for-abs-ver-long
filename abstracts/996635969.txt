interlibrary loan ( abbreviated ill , and sometimes called interloan , interlending , document delivery , document supply , or interlibrary services , abbreviated ils ) is a service whereby a patron of one library can borrow books , dvds , music , etc . and/or receive photocopies of documents that are owned by another library . the user makes a request with their home library ; which , acting as an intermediary , identifies libraries with the desired item , places the request , receives the item , makes it available to the user , as well as arranges for its return . the lending library usually sets a due date and overdue fees of the material borrowed . although books and journal articles are the most frequently requested items , some libraries will lend audio recordings , video recordings , maps , sheet music , and microforms of all kinds . in some cases , nominal fees accompany the interlibrary loan services . the term document delivery may also be used for a related service , namely the supply of journal articles and other copies on a personalized basis , whether these come from other libraries or direct from the publishers . the end user is usually responsible for any fees , such as costs for postage or photocopying . commercial document delivery services will borrow on behalf of any customer willing to pay for their rates .
