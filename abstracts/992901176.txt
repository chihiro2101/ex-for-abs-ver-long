force spectroscopy is a set of techniques for the study of the interactions and the binding forces between individual molecules . these methods can be used to measure the mechanical properties of single polymer molecules or proteins , or individual chemical bonds . the name '' force spectroscopy '' , although widely used in the scientific community , is somewhat misleading , because there is no true matter-radiation interaction . techniques that can be used to perform force spectroscopy include atomic force microscopy , optical tweezers , magnetic tweezers , acoustic force spectroscopy , microneedles , and biomembranes . force spectroscopy measures the behavior of a molecule under stretching or torsional mechanical force . in this way a great deal has been learned in recent years about the mechanochemical coupling in the enzymes responsible for muscle contraction , transport in the cell , energy generation ( f1-atpase ) , dna replication and transcription ( polymerases ) , dna unknotting and unwinding ( topoisomerases and helicases ) . as a single-molecule technique , as opposed to typical ensemble spectroscopies , it allows a researcher to determine properties of the particular molecule under study . in particular , rare events such as conformational change , which are masked in an ensemble , may be observed .
