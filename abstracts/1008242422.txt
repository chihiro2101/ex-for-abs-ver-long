a primality test is an algorithm for determining whether an input number is prime . among other fields of mathematics , it is used for cryptography . unlike integer factorization , primality tests do not generally give prime factors , only stating whether the input number is prime or not . factorization is thought to be a computationally difficult problem , whereas primality testing is comparatively easy ( its running time is polynomial in the size of the input ) . some primality tests prove that a number is prime , while others like millerâ€“rabin prove that a number is composite . therefore , the latter might more accurately be called compositeness tests instead of primality tests .
