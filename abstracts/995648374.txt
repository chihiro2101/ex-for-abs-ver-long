a machine tool is a machine for handling or machining metal or other rigid materials , usually by cutting , boring , grinding , shearing , or other forms of deformation . machine tools employ some sort of tool that does the cutting or shaping . all machine tools have some means of constraining the workpiece and provide a guided movement of the parts of the machine . thus the relative movement between the workpiece and the cutting tool ( which is called the toolpath ) is controlled or constrained by the machine to at least some extent , rather than being entirely '' offhand '' or '' freehand '' . it is a power driven metal cutting machine which assists in managing the needed relative motion between cutting tool and the job that changes the size and shape of the job material . define metal cutting , mechanicalsite.com , retrieved 2019-05-04 . the precise definition of the term machine tool varies among users , as discussed below . while all machine tools are '' machines that help people to make things '' , not all factory machines are machine tools . today machine tools are typically powered other than by human muscle ( e.g . , electrically , hydraulically , or via line shaft ) , used to make manufactured parts ( components ) in various ways that include cutting or certain other kinds of deformation . with their inherent precision , machine tools enabled the economical production of interchangeable parts .
