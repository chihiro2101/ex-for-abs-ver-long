die another day is a 2002 spy film and the twentieth film in the james bond series produced by eon productions . it was produced by michael g . wilson and barbara broccoli , and directed by lee tamahori . it is the fourth and final film to star pierce brosnan as mi6 agent james bond ; it was also the last film to have john cleese as q , and samantha bond as miss moneypenny . halle berry co-stars as nsa agent jinx johnson , the bond girl . the plot follows bond as he attempts to locate a mole in british intelligence who betrayed him and a britons billionaire who is later revealed to be connected to a north korean operative that he seemingly killed . die another day marked the james bond franchise 's 40th anniversary ; consequently , the film includes references to each of the preceding films . the film received mixed reviews ; some critics praised tamahori 's direction , but many disliked its over-reliance on cgi , product placement and its unoriginal plot , as well as the villain . nevertheless , die another day was the highest-grossing james bond film up to that time unadjusted for inflation .
