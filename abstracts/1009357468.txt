biology , an adult is an organism that has reached sexual maturity . in human context , the term adult has meanings associated with social and law concepts . in contrast to a '' minor '' , a legal adult is a person who has attained the age of majority and is therefore regarded as independent , self-sufficient , and responsible . the typical age of attaining legal adulthood is 18 , although definition may vary by legal rights , country , and psychological development . human adulthood encompasses adult development . definitions of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory ; a person may be biologically an adult , and have adult behavior but still be treated as a child if they are under the legal age of majority . conversely , one may legally be an adult but possess none of the maturity and responsibility that may define an adult character . in different cultures there are events that relate passing from being a child to becoming an adult or coming of age . this often encompasses the passing a series of tests to demonstrate that a person is prepared for adulthood , or reaching a specified age , sometimes in conjunction with demonstrating preparation . most modern societies determine legal adulthood based on reaching a legally specified age without requiring a demonstration of physical maturity or preparation for adulthood .
