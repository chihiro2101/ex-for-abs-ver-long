forkhead box protein p2 ( foxp2 ) is a protein that , in humans , is encoded by the foxp2 gene . foxp2 is a member of the forkhead box family of transcription factors , proteins that regulate gene expression by binding to dna . it is expressed in the brain , heart , lungs and digestive system . foxp2 is found in many vertebrates , where it plays an important role in mimicry in birds ( such as birdsong ) and echolocation in bats . foxp2 is also required for the proper development of speech and language in humans . in humans , mutations in foxp2 cause the severe speech and language disorder developmental verbal dyspraxia . studies of the gene in mice and songbirds indicate that it is necessary for vocal imitation and the related motor learning . outside the brain , foxp2 has also been implicated in development of other tissues such as the lung and digestive system . initially identified in 1998 as the genetic cause of a speech disorder in a british family designated the ke family , foxp2 was the first gene discovered to be associated with speech and language and was subsequently dubbed '' the language gene '' . however , other genes are necessary for human language development , and a 2018 analysis confirmed that there was no evidence of recent positive evolutionary selection of foxp2 in humans .
