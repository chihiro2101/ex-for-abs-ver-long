a boot , plural boots , is a type of specific footwear . most boots mainly cover the foot and the ankle , while some also cover some part of the lower calf . some boots extend up the leg , sometimes as far as the knee or even the hip . most boots have a heel that is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the sole , even if the two are made of one piece . traditionally made of leather or rubber , modern boots are made from a variety of materials . boots are worn both for their functionality & ndash ; protecting the foot and leg from water , extreme cold , mud or hazards ( e.g . , work boots may protect wearers from chemicals or use a steel toe ) or providing additional ankle support for strenuous activities with added traction requirements ( e.g . , hiking ) , or may have hobnails on their undersides to protect against wear and to get better grip ; and for reasons of style and fashion . in some cases , the wearing of boots may be required by laws or regulations , such as the regulations in some jurisdictions requiring workers on construction sites to wear steel-toed safety boots . some uniforms include boots as the regulated footwear . boots are recommended as well for motorcycle riders . high-top athletic shoes are generally not considered boots , even though they do cover the ankle , primarily due to the absence of a distinct heel . in britain football ( soccer ) cleats are also called boots .
