in physiology , an action potential ( ap ) occurs when the membrane potential of a specific cell location rapidly rises and falls : this depolarization then causes adjacent locations to similarly depolarize . action potentials occur in several types of animal cells , called excitable cells , which include neurons , myocyte , endocrine cells and in some plant cells . in neurons , action potentials play a central role in cell–cell interaction by providing for—or with regard to saltatory conduction , assisting—the propagation of signals along the neuron 's axon toward axon terminal situated at the ends of an axon ; these signals can then connect with other neurons at synapses , or to motor cells or glands . in other types of cells , their main function is to activate intracellular processes . in muscle cells , for example , an action potential is the first step in the chain of events leading to contraction . in beta cells of the pancreas , they provoke release of insulin . action potentials in neurons are also known as '' nerve impulses '' or '' spikes '' , and the temporal sequence of action potentials generated by a neuron is called its '' spike train '' . a neuron that emits an action potential , or nerve impulse , is often said to '' fire '' . action potentials are generated by special types of voltage-gated ion channels embedded in a cell 's plasma membrane . these channels are shut when the membrane potential is near the ( negative ) resting potential of the cell , but they rapidly begin to open if the membrane potential increases to a precisely defined threshold voltage , depolarising the transmembrane potential . when the channels open , they allow an inward flow of sodium ions , which changes the electrochemical gradient , which in turn produces a further rise in the membrane potential towards zero . this then causes more channels to open , producing a greater electric current across the cell membrane and so on . the process proceeds explosively until all of the available ion channels are open , resulting in a large upswing in the membrane potential . the rapid influx of sodium ions causes the polarity of the plasma membrane to reverse , and the ion channels then rapidly inactivate . as the sodium channels close , sodium ions can no longer enter the neuron , and they are then actively transported back out of the plasma membrane . potassium channels are then activated , and there is an outward current of potassium ions , returning the electrochemical gradient to the resting state . after an action potential has occurred , there is a transient negative shift , called the afterhyperpolarization . in animal cells , there are two primary types of action potentials . one type is generated by voltage-gated sodium channels , the other by voltage-gated calcium channels . sodium-based action potentials usually last for under one millisecond , but calcium-based action potentials may last for 100 milliseconds or longer . in some types of neurons , slow calcium spikes provide the driving force for a long burst of rapidly emitted sodium spikes . in cardiac muscle cells , on the other hand , an initial fast sodium spike provides a '' primer '' to provoke the rapid onset of a calcium spike , which then produces muscle contraction .
