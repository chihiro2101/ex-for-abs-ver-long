a stratovolcano , also known as a composite volcano , is a conical volcano built up by many layers ( strata ) of hardened lava and tephra . unlike shield volcanoes , stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile with a summit crater and periodic intervals of explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions , although some have collapsed summit craters called calderas . the lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far , due to high viscosity . the magma forming this lava is often felsic , having high-to-intermediate levels of silica ( as in rhyolite , dacite , or andesite ) , with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma . extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon , but have travelled as far as . stratovolcanoes are sometimes called '' composite volcanoes '' because of their composite stratified structure built up from sequential outpourings of erupted materials . they are among the most common types of volcanoes , in contrast to the less common shield volcanoes . two famous examples of stratovolcanoes are krakatoa in indonesia , known for its 1883 eruption of krakatoa , and vesuvius in italy , whose catastrophic eruption in ad 79 buried the roman cities of pompeii and herculaneum . both eruptions claimed thousands of lives . in modern times , mount st . helens and mount pinatubo have erupted catastrophically , but fortunately with fewer deaths . the possible existence of stratovolcanoes on other terrestrial bodies of the solar system has not been conclusively demonstrated . one possible exception is the existence of some isolated massifs on mars , for example the zephyria tholus .
