christian identity ( also known as identity christianity ) is an interpretation of christianity which advocates the belief that only germanic , anglo-saxon , celtic , nordic , aryan people and people of kindred blood are the descendants of abraham , isaac , and jacob and are therefore the descendants of the ancient israelites . independently practiced by individuals , local church , and some prison gangs , it is not an organized religion , nor is it affiliated with specific christian denominations . its theology is a racial interpretation of christianity . christian identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by authors who regarded europeans as the '' chosen people '' and jews as the cursed offspring of cain , the '' serpent hybrid '' or serpent seed ( a belief which is known as the two-seedline doctrine ) . white supremacist sects and gangs later adopted many of these teachings . christian identity promotes the idea that all non-whites ( people who are not of wholly european descent ) will either be genocide or slavery in order to serve the white race in the new heavenly kingdom on earth under the reign of jesus christ . its doctrine states that only '' adamic '' ( white ) people can achieve salvation and enter paradise . many of its adherents are millennialism . it is considered racism , anti-semitic , and white supremacy by the southern poverty law center .
