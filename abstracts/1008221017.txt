the mandarin orange ( citrus reticulata ) , also known as the mandarin or mandarine , is a small citrus tree fruit . treated as a member of a distinct species of orange , it is usually eaten plain or in fruit salads . the tangerine is a group of orange-coloured citrus fruit consisting of hybrids of mandarin orange with some pomelo contribution . mandarins are smaller and oblate , unlike the spherical common oranges ( which are a mandarin-pomelo hybrid ) . the taste is considered less sour , as well as sweeter and stronger . a ripe mandarin is firm to slightly soft , heavy for its size , and pebbly-skinned . the peel is thin , loose , with little white mesocarp , so they are usually easier to peel and to split into segments . hybrids usually have these traits to a lesser degree . the mandarin is tender and is damaged easily by cold . it can be grown in tropical and subtropical areas . according to genetic studies , the mandarin was one of the original citrus species ; through breeding or natural hybridization , it is the ancestor of many hybrid citrus cultivars . with the citron and pomelo , it is the ancestor of the most commercially important hybrids ( such as sweet and sour oranges , grapefruit , and many lemons and limes ) . the mandarin has also been hybridized with other citrus species , such as the desert lime and the kumquat . though the ancestral mandarin was bitter , most commercial mandarin strains derive from hybridization with pomelo , which give them a sweet fruit .
