a pedestrian crossing ( primarily british english ) or crosswalk ( primarily american english ) is a place designated for pedestrians to cross a road , street or avenue . the term '' pedestrian crossing '' is also used in some international treaties that pertain to road traffic and road signs , such as the vienna convention on road traffic and the vienna convention on road signs and signals . marked pedestrian crossings are often found at intersections , but may also be at other points on busy roads that would otherwise be too unsafe to cross without assistance due to vehicle numbers , speed or road widths . they are also commonly installed where large numbers of pedestrians are attempting to cross ( such as in shopping areas ) or where vulnerable road users ( such as school children ) regularly cross . rules govern usage of the pedestrian crossings to ensure safety ; for example , in some areas , the pedestrian must be more than halfway across the crosswalk before the driver proceeds . in general , there are two types of intersections including signalized and unsignalised intersections . signalised pedestrian crossings clearly separate when each type of traffic ( pedestrians or road vehicles ) can use the crossing . unsignalised crossings generally assist pedestrians , and usually prioritise pedestrians , depending on the locality . pelican crossing use signals to keep pedestrians together where they can be seen by motorists , and where they can cross most safety across the flow of vehicle traffic , whereas zebra crossings are uncontrolled and more appropriate for lower people flows . what appears to be just pedestrian crossings can also be created largely as a traffic calming technique , especially when combined with other features like pedestrian priority , refuge islands , or raised surfaces .
