the welsh marches is an imprecisely defined area along the border between england and wales in the united kingdom . the precise meaning of the term has varied at different periods . the english term welsh march ( in latin language marchia walliae ) often rendered marcia wallie in documents . was originally used in the middle ages to denote the marches between england and the principality of wales , in which marcher lords had specific rights , exercised to some extent independently of the king of england . in modern usage , '' the marches '' is often used to describe those english counties which lie along the border with wales , particularly shropshire and herefordshire , and sometimes adjoining areas of wales . however , at one time the marches included all of the historic counties of cheshire , shropshire , herefordshire , worcestershire and gloucestershire . in this context the word march means a border region or frontier , and is cognate with the verb '' to march , '' both ultimately derived from proto-indo-european mereg- , '' edge '' or '' boundary '' .
