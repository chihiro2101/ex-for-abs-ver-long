a virtual economy ( or sometimes synthetic economy ) is an emergent economy existing in a virtual world , usually exchanging virtual goods in the context of an online game , particularly in massively multiplayer online games ( mmos ) . people enter these virtual economies for recreation and entertainment rather than necessity , which means that virtual economies lack the aspects of a real economy that are not considered to be '' fun '' ( for instance , avatars in a virtual economy often do not need to buy food in order to survive , and usually do not have any biological needs at all ) . however , some people do interact with virtual economies for '' real '' economic benefit . despite primarily dealing with in-game currencies , this term also encompasses the selling of virtual currency for real money .
