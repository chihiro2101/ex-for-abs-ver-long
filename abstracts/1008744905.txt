tobacco mosaic virus ( tmv ) is a positive-sense single-stranded rna virus species in the genus tobamovirus that infects a wide range of plants , especially tobacco and other members of the family solanaceae . the infection causes characteristic patterns , such as '' mosaic '' -like mottling and discoloration on the leaf ( hence the name ) . tmv was the first virus to be discovered . although it was known from the late 19th century that a non-bacterial infectious disease was damaging tobacco crops , it was not until 1930 that the infectious agent was determined to be a virus . it is the first pathogen identified as a virus .
