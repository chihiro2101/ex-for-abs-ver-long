ethnic minorities in china are the non-han chinese population in the people 's republic of china ( prc ) . the prc officially recognizes 55 minority group groups within china in addition to the han majority . as of 2010 , the combined population of officially-recognized minority groups comprised 8.49 % of the population of mainland china . in addition to these officially-recognized ethnic minority groups , there are chinese nationals who privately classify themselves as members of unrecognized ethnic groups , such as the very small chinese jewish , tuvan , and ili turki communities , as well as the much larger oirat and japanese communities . in chinese , 'ethnic minority ' has translated to ( , 'ethnic group ' ) over minzu . the chinese model for identifying and categorizing ethnic minorities established at the founding of the prc followed the soviet model , drawing inspiration from joseph stalin 's 1953 'four commons ' criteria to identify ethnic groups : '' ( 1 ) a distinct language ; ( 2 ) a recognized indigenous homeland or common territory ; ( 3 ) a common economic life ; and ( 4 ) a strong sense of identity and distinctive customs , including dress , religion and foods . '' the categorization of 55 minority groups was a major step forward from denial of the existence of different ethnic groups in china which had been the policy of sun yat-sen 's nationalist government that came to power in 1911 , which also engaged in the common use of derogatory names to refer to minorities ( a practice officially abolished in 1951 ) . however , the communist party 's categorization was also rampantly criticized since it reduced the number of recognized ethnic groups by eightfold , and today the wei shibie menzu ( literally 'undistinguished ethnic groups ' ) total more than 730,000 people . these groups include geija , khmu , kucong , mang , deng , sherpas , bajia , yi and youtai ( jewish ) .
