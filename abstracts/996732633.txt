the pentium pro is a sixth-generation x86 microprocessor developed and manufactured by intel and introduced on november 1 , 1995 . it introduced the p6 microarchitecture ( sometimes referred to as i686 ) and was originally intended to replace the original pentium in a full range of applications . while the pentium and pentium mmx had 3.1 and 4.5 & nbsp ; million transistors , respectively , the pentium pro contained 5.5 & nbsp ; million transistors . later , it was reduced to a more narrow role as a server and high-end desktop processor and was used in supercomputers like asci red , the first computer to reach the teraflops performance mark . the pentium pro was capable of both dual- and quad-processor configurations . it only came in one form factor , the relatively large rectangular socket 8 . the pentium pro was succeeded by the pentium ii xeon in 1998 .
