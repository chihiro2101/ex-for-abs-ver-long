jugurtha or jugurthen ( libyco-berber yugurten or yugarten , c . 160 & ndash ; 104 bc ) was a king of numidia . when the numidian king micipsa , who had adopted jugurtha , died in 118 bc , jugurtha and his two adoptive brothers , hiempsal and adherbal , succeeded him . jugurtha arranged to have hiempsal killed and , after a civil war , defeated and killed adherbal in 112 bc . the death of adherbal , which was against the wishes of rome , along with the growing popular anger in rome at jugurtha 's success in bribing roman senators ( and thus avoiding roman retribution for his crimes ) , led to the jugurthine war between rome and numidia which , after a number of battles in numidia between roman and numidian forces , eventually led to jugurtha 's capture in 106 bc and his being paraded through rome as part of gaius marius ' roman triumph . he was then thrown into the tullianum prison where he died of strangulation or starvation in 104 bc . he was survived by his son , oxyntas .
