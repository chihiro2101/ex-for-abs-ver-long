a ship prefix is a combination of letters , usually , abbreviations , used in front of the name of a civilian or naval ship that has historically served numerous purposes , such as identifying the vessel 's mode of propulsion , purpose , or ownership/nationality . in the modern environment , prefixes are used inconsistently in civilian service , however , in government service , the vessels prefix is seldom missing due to government regulations dictating a certain prefix be present . today the common practice is to use a single prefix for all warships of a nation 's navy , and other prefixes for auxiliaries and ships of allied services , such as coast guards . for example , the modern navy of japan adopts the prefix '' js '' â€“ japanese ship . however , not all navies used prefixes ; this includes the significant navies of china , france ( though france has a nato designation for its naval prefix , which is fs ( french ship ) ) , russia and spain , which like france uses the nato designation sps ( spanish ship ) if needed .
