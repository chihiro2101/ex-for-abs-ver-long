heat transfer is a discipline of thermal engineering that concerns the generation , use , conversion , and exchange of thermal energy ( heat ) between physical systems . heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms , such as thermal conduction , thermal convection , thermal radiation , and transfer of energy by phase changes . engineers also consider the transfer of mass of differing chemical species , either cold or hot , to achieve heat transfer . while these mechanisms have distinct characteristics , they often occur simultaneously in the same system . heat conduction , also called diffusion , is the direct microscopic exchange of kinetic energy of particles through the boundary between two systems . when an object is at a different temperature from another body or its surroundings , heat flows so that the body and the surroundings reach the same temperature , at which point they are in thermal equilibrium . such spontaneous heat transfer always occurs from a region of high temperature to another region of lower temperature , as described in the second law of thermodynamics . heat convection occurs when bulk flow of a fluid ( gas or liquid ) carries heat along with the flow of matter in the fluid . the flow of fluid may be forced by external processes , or sometimes ( in gravitational fields ) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid ( for example in a fire plume ) , thus influencing its own transfer . the latter process is often called '' natural convection '' . all convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion , as well . another form of convection is forced convection . in this case the fluid is forced to flow by use of a pump , fan or other mechanical means . thermal radiation occurs through a vacuum or any transparent medium ( solid or fluid or gas ) . it is the transfer of energy by means of photons in electromagnetic waves governed by the same laws .
