a belt is a flexible band or strap , typically made of leather or heavy cloth and worn around the waist or above the hips , that is usually of less circumference than the hips underneath . belts are used to secure or hold up clothing , like trousers or other articles of clothing , in a manner similar to suspenders and garters . some trousers come with belt loops around the waist , which the belt goes through . belts can have many uses , but they are often used as a fashion accessory , with many colours , styles , and finishes . in heavy metal subculture , bullet belts and studded belts are worn . pouches to carry objects such as coin purses , holsters , scabbards , inr≈çs , etc . have been attached to belts in lieu of pockets . belts are often secured with some type of metal buckle , which vary from simple one-color finishes to elaborately decorated belt plates with embossed or bas-relief images or multicolored logos . while belts can be adjusted to suit the circumference of a person 's waist , belts are sold in different lengths due to the variety in waist sizes . belts are generally designed for men 's or women 's fashion use , although some casual belts are unisex . due to the size constraints of belt loops , any belt designed for use with belt loops can not be too wide . for women 's belts designed to be worn over a dress , however , belts can be wider , with some wide belts called '' waist cinchers '' overlapping with corsets in their appearance and function .
