the greek revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in northern europe and the united states . it revived the style of ancient greek architecture , in particular the greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . a product of hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from roman architecture . the term was first used by charles robert cockerell in a lecture he gave as professor of architecture to the royal academy of arts , london in 1842 . j . turner ( ed . ) , encyclopedia of american art before 1914 , new york , p . 198 . . with a newfound access to greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the doric and ionic orders . in each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of france and italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . this was especially the case in britain , germany and the united states , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . the taste for all things greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called neo-grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of thomas hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as neoclassical , empire , russian empire , and regency architecture in britain . greek revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the american civil war ( 1860s ) and even later in scotland .
