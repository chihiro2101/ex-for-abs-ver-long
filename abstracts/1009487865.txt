the calendar of saints is the traditional christian method of organizing a liturgical year by associating each day with one or more saints and referring to the day as the feast day or feast of said saint . the word '' feast '' in this context does not mean '' a large meal , typically a celebratory one '' , but instead '' an annual religious celebration , a day dedicated to a particular saint '' . the system arose from the early christian custom of commemorating each martyr annually on the date of their death , or birth into heaven , a date therefore referred to in latin as the martyr 's dies natalis ( 'day of birth ' ) . in the eastern orthodox church , a calendar of saints is called a menologion . '' menologion '' may also mean a set of icons on which saints are depicted in the order of the dates of their feasts , often made in two panels .
