a spelling reform is a deliberate , often authoritatively sanctioned or mandated change to spelling rules . proposals for such reform are fairly common , and over the years , many languages have undergone such reforms . recent high-profile examples are the german orthography reform of 1996 and the on-off portuguese spelling reform of 1990 , which is still being ratified . there are various goals which may drive such reforms : facilitating literacy and international communication , making etymology clearer , or for aesthetic or political reasons . opposition is often based upon concern that old literature will become inaccessible , the presumed suppression of regional accents , the need to learn the new spellings , making etymology less clear , or simple conservatism based on concern over unforeseen effects . reforms which mainly eliminate needless difficulties ought to take account of such arguments . reform efforts are further hampered by habit and , for many languages , a lack of language academy to set new spelling standards . spelling reform may also be associated with wider discussion about the official script , as well as language planning and language reform . orthographic reform may be reverted . this happened in romanian .
