the enteric nervous system ( ens ) or intrinsic nervous system is one of the main divisions of the autonomic nervous system ( ans ) and consists of a mesh-like system of neurons that governs the function of the gastrointestinal tract . it is capable of acting independently of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems , although it may be influenced by them . the ens is also called the second brain . it is derived from neural crest cells . the enteric nervous system is capable of operating independently of the brain and spinal cord , but does rely on innervation from the autonomic nervous system via the vagus nerve and prevertebral ganglia in healthy subjects . however , studies have shown that the system is operable with a severed vagus nerve . the neurons of the enteric nervous system control the motor functions of the system , in addition to the secretion of gastrointestinal enzymes . these neurons communicate through many neurotransmitters similar to the cns , including acetylcholine , dopamine , and serotonin . the large presence of serotonin and dopamine in the gut are key areas of research for neurogastroenterologists .
