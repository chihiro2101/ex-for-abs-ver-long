image : cantilever examples.svg right thumb 200px a schematic image of three types of cantilever . the top example has a full moment connection ( like a horizontal flagpole bolted to the side of a building ) . the middle example is created by an extension of a simple supported beam ( such as the way a springboard is anchored and extends over the edge of a swimming pool ) . the bottom example is created by adding a robin boundary condition to the beam element , which essentially adds an elastic spring to the end board . the middle and bottom example may be considered structurally equivalent , depending on the effective stiffness of the spring and beam element a cantilever is a rigid structural element that extends horizontally and is supported at only one end . typically it extends from a flat vertical surface such as a wall , to which it must be firmly attached . like other structural elements , a cantilever can be formed as a beam , plate , truss , or slab . when subjected to a structural load at its far , unsupported end , the cantilever carries the load to the support where it applies a shear stress and a bending moment . cantilever construction allows overhanging structures without additional support .
