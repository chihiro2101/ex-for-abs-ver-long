in organic chemistry , the diels–alder reaction is a chemical reaction between a conjugated diene and a substituted alkene , commonly termed the dienophile , to form a substituted cyclohexene derivative . it is the prototypical example of a pericyclic reaction with a concerted reaction . more specifically , it is classified as a thermally-allowed 4+2 cycloaddition with woodward–hoffmann rules π 4 s + π 2 s . it was first described by otto diels and kurt alder in 1928 . for the discovery of this reaction , they were awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in 1950 . through the simultaneous construction of two new carbon–carbon bonds , the diels–alder reaction provides a reliable way to form six-membered rings with good control over the regio- and stereochemical outcomes . consequently , it has served as a powerful and widely applied tool for the introduction of chemical complexity in the synthesis of natural products and new materials . the underlying concept has also been applied to π-systems involving heteroatoms , such as carbonyls and imines , which furnish the corresponding heterocycles ; this variant is known as the hetero-diels–alder reaction . the reaction has also been generalized to other ring sizes , although none of these generalizations have matched the formation of six-membered rings in terms of scope or versatility . because of the negative values of δh° and δs° for a typical diels–alder reaction , the microscopic reverse of a diels–alder reaction becomes favorable at high temperatures , although this is of synthetic importance for only a limited range of diels-alder adducts , generally with some special structural features ; this reverse reaction is known as the retro-diels–alder reaction .
