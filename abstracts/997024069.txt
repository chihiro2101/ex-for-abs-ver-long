in astrology , an aspect is an angle the planets make to each other in the horoscope , also to the ascendant , midheaven , descendant , imum coeli , and other points of astrological interest . aspects are measured by the angular distance in degrees and minutes of ecliptic between two points , as viewed from earth . according to astrological tradition , they indicate the timing of transitions and developmental changes in the lives of people and affairs relative to the earth . as an example , if an astrologer creates a horoscope that shows the apparent positions of the celestial bodies at the time of a person 's birth ( a natal chart ) , and the angular distance between mars and venus is 92째 of arc , the chart is said to have the aspect '' venus square mars '' with an orb of 2째 ( i.e . , it is 2째 away from being an exact square ; a square being a 90째 aspect ) . the more exact an aspect , the stronger or more dominant it is said to be in shaping character or manifesting change .
