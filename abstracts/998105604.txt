dorothy clutterbuck ( 19 january 1880 â€“ 12 january 1951 ) , was a wealthy englishwoman who was named by gerald gardner as a leading member of the new forest coven , a group of pagan wicca into which gardner claimed to have been initiated in 1939 . she has therefore become a figure of some significance in the history of wicca . clutterbuck was a practising anglican christian , and never identified herself as a witch . researchers have debated whether the surviving evidence of her own writings indicates that she had any unconventional religious leanings at all .
