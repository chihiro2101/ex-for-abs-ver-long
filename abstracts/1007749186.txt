a parliamentary system or parliamentary democracy is a system of democracy government of a state ( or subordinate entity ) where the executive derives its democratic legitimacy from its ability to command the confidence of the legislature , typically a parliament , and is also held accountable to that parliament . in a parliamentary system , the head of state is usually a person distinct from the head of government . this is in contrast to a presidential system , where the head of state often is also the head of government and , most importantly , where the executive does not derive its democratic legitimacy from the legislature . countries with parliamentary democracies may be constitutional monarchy , where a monarch is the head of state while the head of government is almost always a member of parliament ( such as denmark , norway , japan , malaysia , sweden and the united kingdom ) , or parliamentary republics , where a mostly ceremonial president is the head of state while the head of government is regularly from the legislature ( such as ireland , germany , india , italy and singapore ) . in a few parliamentary republics , such as botswana , kiribati and south africa , among some others , the head of government is also head of state , but is elected by and is answerable to parliament . in bicameral parliaments , the head of government is generally , though not always , a member of the lower house . parliamentarianism is the dominant form of government in europe , with 32 of its 50 sovereign states being parliamentarian . it is also common in the caribbean , being the form of government of 10 of its 13 island states , and in oceania . elsewhere in the world , parliamentary countries are less common , but they are distributed through all continents , most often in former colonies of the british empire that subscribe to a particular brand of parliamentarianism known as the westminster system .
