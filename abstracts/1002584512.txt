in class-based programming , the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of object creation without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created . this is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes , or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor .
