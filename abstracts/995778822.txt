makossa is a noted cameroonian popular urban musical style . like much other late 20th century music of sub-saharan africa , it uses strong electric bass rhythms and prominent brass . in the 1980s makossa had a wave of mainstream success across africa and to a lesser extent abroad . makossa , which means '' ( i ) dance '' in the douala language , section '' cultural-based terms '' ( last line ) originated from a douala dance called the kossa . emmanuel nelle eyoum started using the refrain kossa kossa in his songs with his group '' los calvinos '' . the style began to take shape in the 1950s though the first recordings were not seen until a decade later . there were artists such as eboa lotin , misse ngoh and especially manu dibango , who popularised makossa throughout the world with his song '' soul makossa '' in 1972 . the chant from the song , mamako , mamasa , maka makossa , was later used by michael jackson in '' wan na be startin ' somethin ' '' in 1983 . many other performers followed suit . the 2010 world cup also brought makossa to the international stage as shakira sampled the golden sounds popular song '' zamina mina ( zangalewa ) '' . makassi is a lighter style of makossa .
