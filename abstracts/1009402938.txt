much of the subscribed funds came from lancashire , where great profits were being made in the cotton industries . the construction of the line was the subject of much opposition by landowners , who organised a campaign in the early 1830s to prevent the l & br from driving a line across their estates . turbulent public meetings were held in towns in west hertfordshire to protest against the project , including one held at the king 's arms public house in berkhamsted . another was held in watford which was attended by wealthy and influential peerage who had property interests on the planned route of the line : the earl of essex was keen to protect his cassiobury park from invasion by the '' iron horse '' , as was the earl of clarendon , who owned the grove estate . the anatomist sir astley cooper was also in attendance , intent on preventing the new railway from cutting across his gadebridge estate . on 22 june 1832 , lord brownlow of ashridge voiced his opposition in the house of lords to '' the forcing of the proposed railway through the land and property of so great a proportion of dissentient landowners . '' the l & br company 's first application for an act of parliament to construct the line was rejected in 1832 , due to pressure from landowners and road and canal interests . the railway route proposals through hertfordshire were modified ; a second act was approved in may 1833 , and the line received royal assent . construction began in november of that year . the line would follow the river bulbourne instead of the river gade , skirting around the edge of hemel hempstead to protect sir astley cooper 's interests ; for this reason , hemel hempstead railway station is located outside the town centre , at boxmoor .
