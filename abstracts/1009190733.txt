urban secession is a city 's secession from its surrounding region to form a new political unit . this new unit is usually a subdivision of the same country as its surroundings . many cities around the world form a separate local government unit . the most common reason is that the population of the city is too large for the city to be subsumed into a larger local government unit . however , in a few cases , full sovereignty may be attained , in which case the unit is usually called a city-state . it is an extreme form of urban autonomy , which can be expressed in less formal terms or by ordinary legislation such as a city charter .
