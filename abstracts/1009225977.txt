the protectorate was the period during the commonwealth ( or , to monarchists , the interregnum ) when england and wales , scotland , ireland , and the english overseas possessions were governed by a lord protector as a republic . the protectorate began in 1653 when , following the dissolution of the rump parliament and then barebone 's parliament , oliver cromwell was appointed lord protector of the commonwealth under the terms of the instrument of government . in 1659 , the protectorate parliament was dissolved by the committee of safety as richard cromwell , who had succeeded his father as lord protector , was unable to keep control of the parliament and the army . this marked the end of the protectorate and the start of a second period of rule by the rump parliament as the legislature and the council of state as the executive .
