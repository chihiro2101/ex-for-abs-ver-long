in printing , anilox is a method used to provide a measured amount of ink to a flexography ( flexo ) printing plate . an anilox roll is a hard cylinder , usually constructed of a steel or aluminum core which is coated by an industrial ceramic whose surface is engraved with millions of very fine dimples , known as anilox cells . in the printing process , the anilox roll is coated in a precise layer of ink that is then transferred to the raised portions of the printing plate . the number , size , and geometry of the anilox cells vary and will determine the amount of ink that the anilox roll delivers to the plate .
