the historicity of the joseph narrative can not be demonstrated . according to researches on the historicity of the old testament , the descent of abraham into egypt as recorded in genesis 12:10-20 should correspond to the early years of the 2nd millennium bce , which is before the time the hyksos ruled in egypt , but would coincide with the semitic parties known to have visited the egyptians circa 1900 bce , as documented in the painting of a west-asiatic procession of the tomb of khnumhotep ii at beni hasan . it might be possible to associate abraham to such known semitic visitors to egypt , as they would have been ethnically connected . the period of joseph and jacob in egypt ( genesis 39:50 ) , where they were in favour at the egyptian court and joseph held high administrative positions next to the ruler of the land , would correspond to the time the hyksos ruled in egypt , during the fifteenth dynasty . the time of moses and the migration to canaan related in the exodus could also correspond to the expulsion of the hyksos from egypt . hermann gunkel , hugo gressmann and gerhard von rad identified the story of joseph as a literary composition , in the genre of romance , or the novella . as a novella , it is read as reworking legends and myths , in particular the motifs of his reburial in canaan , associated with the egyptian god osiris . others compare the burial of his bones at shechem , with the disposal of dionysus 's bones at delphi . for schenke , the tradition of joseph 's burial at shechem is understood as a secondary , israelitic historical interpretation woven around a more ancient canaanite shrine in that area . the reworked legends and folklore were probably inserted into the developing textual tradition of the bible between the 8th and 6th centuries bce . most scholars place its composition in a genre that flourished in the persian period of the exile .
