knx is an open standard ( see en 50090 , iso/iec 14543 ) for commercial and domestic building automation . knx devices can manage lighting , blinds and shutters , hvac , security systems , energy management , audio video , white goods , displays , remote control , etc . knx evolved from three earlier standards ; the european home systems protocol ( ehs ) , batibus , and the european installation bus ( eib or instabus ) . it can use twisted pair ( in a tree , line or star topology ) , powerline , rf , or ip links . on this network , the devices form distributed computing and tight interaction is possible . this is implemented via interworking models with standardised datapoint types and objects , modelling logical device channels .
