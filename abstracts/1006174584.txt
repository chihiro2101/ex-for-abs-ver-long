a backpack—also called knapsack , rucksack , rucksac , pack , sackpack , booksack , bookbag or backsack—is , in its simplest frameless form , a cloth sack carried on one 's back and secured with two straps that go over the shoulders , but it can have an external frame , internal frame , and there are bodypacks . backpacks are commonly used by hiking and students , and are often preferred to handbags for carrying heavy loads or carrying any sort of equipment , because of the limited capacity to carry heavy weights for long periods of time in the hands . large backpacks , used to carry loads over , as well as smaller sports backpacks ( e.g . running , cycling , hiking and hydration ) , usually offload the largest part ( up to about 90 % ) of their weight onto padded hip belts , leaving the shoulder straps mainly for stabilising the load . this improves the potential to carry heavy loads , as the hips are stronger than the shoulders , and also increases agility and balance , since the load rides nearer the wearer 's own center of mass .
