the desmostylia ( from greek δεσμά desma , '' bundle '' , and στῦλος stylos , '' pillar '' ) are an extinct order of aquatic mammals that existed from the early oligocene ( rupelian ) to the late miocene ( tortonian ) . desmostylians are the only known extinct order of marine mammals the desmostylia , together with sirenia and proboscidea ( and possibly embrithopoda ) , have traditionally been assigned to the afrotherian clade tethytheria , a group named after the paleoocean tethys around which they originally evolved . the relationship between the desmostylia and the other orders within the tethytheria has been disputed ; if the common ancestor of all tethytheres was semiaquatic , the proboscidea became secondarily terrestrial ; alternatively , the desmostylia and sirenia could have evolved independently into aquatic mammals . the assignment of desmostylia to afrotheria has always been problematic from a biogeographic standpoint , given that africa was the locus of the early evolution of the afrotheria while the desmostylia have only been found along the pacific rim . that assignment has been seriously undermined by a 2014 cladistic analysis that places anthracobunids and desmostylians , two major groups of putative non-african afrotheres , close to each other within the laurasiatherian order perissodactyla . however , a posterior study shows that , while anthracobunids are definite perissodactyls , desmostylians share the same number of characteristics necessary for either paenungulata or perissodactyla , making their former assessment as afrotheres a possibility .
