the mineral bastnäsite ( or bastnaesite ) is one of a family of three carbonate-fluoride minerals , which includes bastnäsite- ( ce ) with a formula of ( ce , la ) co 3 f , bastnäsite- ( la ) with a formula of ( la , ce ) co 3 f , and bastnäsite- ( y ) with a formula of ( y , ce ) co 3 f . some of the bastnäsites contain oh & minus ; instead of f & minus ; and receive the name of hydroxylbastnasite . most bastnäsite is bastnäsite- ( ce ) , and cerium is by far the most common of the rare earths in this class of minerals . bastnäsite and the phosphate mineral monazite are the two largest sources of cerium and other rare-earth elements . bastnäsite was first described by the swedish chemist wilhelm hisinger in 1838 . it is named for the bastnäs mine near riddarhyttan , västmanland , sweden . bastnäsite also occurs as very high-quality specimens at the zagi mountains , pakistan . bastnäsite occurs in alkali granite and syenite and in associated pegmatites . it also occurs in carbonatites and in associated fenites and other metasomatism . bastnasite . mineral galleries . retrieved on 2011-10-14 .
