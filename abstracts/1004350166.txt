philip iii arrhidaeus ; c . 359 bc & ndash ; 25 december , 317 bc ) reigned as king of macedonia from after 11 june 323 bc until his death . he was a son of king philip ii of macedon by philinna of larissa , and thus an elder half-brother of alexander the great . named arrhidaeus at birth , he assumed the name philip when he ascended to the throne . as arrhidaeus grew older it became apparent that he had mild learning difficulties . plutarch was of the view that he became disabled by means of an attempt on his life by philip ii 's wife , queen olympias , who wanted to eliminate a possible rival to her son , alexander , through the employment of pharmaka ( drugs/spells ) ; however , most modern authorities doubt the truth of this claim . alexander was fond of arrhidaeus and took him on his campaigns , both to protect his life and to prevent his use as a pawn in any prospective challenge for the throne . after alexander 's death in babylon in 323 bc , the macedonian army in asia proclaimed arrhidaeus as king ; however , he served merely as a figurehead and as the pawn of a series of powerful generals .
