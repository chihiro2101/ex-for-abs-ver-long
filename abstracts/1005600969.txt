this is a list of entities that have issued postage stamps at some point since stamps were introduced in 1840 . the list includes any kind of governmental entity or officially approved organisation that has issued distinctive types of stamp . these include post offices in foreign countries and postal services organised by military occupations , international organisations , colonies , provinces , city-states and some revolutionary movements . the list includes members of the universal postal union that are also listed at postal organisations . many of these entities are historic and some were very short-lived indeed . philatelists and stamp collecting often refer to the entities that no longer issue stamps as dead countries . the dates are the generally agreed-upon dates of first and last stamp issues . '' date of issue '' is taken to mean the date when a particular type or variation was issued but its usage would often continue for many years . for example , although an entity may have issued its last stamp in 1951 , actual usage may have continued until 1960 : in that case , 1951 is the last stamp issue date . besides the period of which stamps were issued in the name of a particular entity , the list under that entity also bears any other name in which stamps had been issued for territory , name of any other entity which had had its stamps used in that territory , or new names which had subsequently replaced the name of that entity , together with their respective periods .
