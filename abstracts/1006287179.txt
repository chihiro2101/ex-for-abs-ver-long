the common lisp object system ( clos ) is the facility for object-oriented programming which is part of ansi common lisp . clos is a powerful dynamic object system which differs radically from the oop facilities found in more static languages such as c++ or java . clos was inspired by earlier lisp object systems such as mit flavors and commonloops , although it is more general than either . originally proposed as an add-on , clos was adopted as part of the ansi standard for common lisp and has been adapted into other lisp dialects such as eulisp or emacs lisp . '' clos is a standard . multiple vendors supply clos . clos ( or parts of it ) is being used to add object-orientation to other lisp dialects such as eulisp or emacs lisp . '' p . 110 of veitch 1998
