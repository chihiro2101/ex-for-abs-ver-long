from this comes the catchphrase : '' do n't immanentize the eschaton ! '' , which simply means : '' do not try to make that which belongs to the afterlife happen here and now '' or '' do n't try to create heaven on earth . '' when voegelin uses the term gnosis negatively , it is to reflect the word as found in the manichaeism and valentinianism of antiquity . as it is later then immanentized ( or manifest ) in modernity in the wake of joachim of fiore and in the various ideological movements outlined in his works . voegelin also builds on the term '' gnosticism '' as it is defined by hans jonas in his the gnostic religion , in reference to heidegger 's gnosticism , which is to have an understanding and control over reality that makes mankind as powerful as the role of god in reality . voegelin was arguing from a hellenistic position that good gnosis is derived from pistis ( faith ) and that the pagan tradition made a false distinction between faith and noesis . furthermore , the dualist perspective was the very essence of gnosticism via the misuse of noema and caused a destructive division between the internal and external world in human consciousness . to reconcile the internal ( subjective ) and external ( objective ) world of consciousness was the restoration of order . voegelin , eric , the ecumenic age , order & history , vol . 4 , esp . introduction & chap . 5 . .
