the west lothian question , also known as the english question , is a political issue in the united kingdom . it concerns the question of whether mps from northern ireland , scotland and wales , sitting in the house of commons should be able to vote on matters that affect only england , while mps from england are unable to vote on matters that have been devolved to the northern ireland assembly , the scottish parliament and the welsh parliament . the term west lothian question was coined by enoch powell mp in 1977 after tam dalyell , the labour mp for the scottish constituency of west lothian , raised the matter repeatedly in house of commons debates on devolution . in 2011 the uk government set up the commission on the consequences of devolution for the house of commons , chaired by sir william mckay , former clerk of the house of commons , to examine the question . the commission published a report in 2013 which proposed various procedural changes , including the recommendation that legislation which affects only england should require the support of a majority of mps representing english constituencies . this recommendation was known as english votes for english laws . following the election of a conservative majority government in the 2015 general election , new parliamentary procedures and a legislative grand committee were enacted to bring it into effect .
