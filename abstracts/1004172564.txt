the roland tr-808 rhythm composer , commonly known as the 808 , is a drum machine manufactured by the roland corporation between 1980 and 1983 . it was one of the first drum machines to allow users to program rhythms instead of using preset patterns . unlike its nearest competitor at the time , the more expensive linn lm-1 , the 808 generates sounds using analog synthesis rather than playing samples . launched when electronic music had yet to become mainstream , the 808 received mixed reviews for its unrealistic drum sounds and was a commercial failure . after building approximately 12,000 units , roland discontinued the 808 after its semiconductors became impossible to restock . it was succeeded by the tr-909 in 1983 . over the course of the 1980s , the 808 attracted a cult following among underground musicians for its affordability on the used market , ease of use , and idiosyncratic sounds , particularly its deep , '' booming '' bass drum . it became a cornerstone of the emerging electronic , dance , and hip hop genres , popularized by early hits such as '' sexual healing '' by marvin gaye and '' planet rock '' by afrika bambaataa and the soulsonic force . the 808 was eventually used on more hit records than any other drum machine . its particular popularity in hip hop has made it one of the most influential inventions in popular music , comparable to the fender stratocaster 's impact on rock . its sounds are included with music software and modern drum machines , and it has inspired numerous clones .
