the phaistos disc ( also spelled phaistos disk , phaestos disc ) is a disk of fired clay from the minoan palace of phaistos on the island of crete , possibly dating to the middle or late minoan bronze age ( second millennium b.c . ) . the disk is about 15 & nbsp ; cm ( 5.9 & nbsp ; in ) in diameter and covered on both sides with a spiral of stamped symbols . its purpose and its original place of manufacture remain disputed . it is now on display at the archaeological museum of heraklion . the disc was discovered in 1908 by the italian archaeologist luigi pernier in the minoan palace-site of phaistos , and features 241 tokens , comprising 45 distinct signs , which were apparently made by pressing hieroglyphic '' seals '' into a disc of soft clay , in a clockwise sequence spiraling toward the center of the disk . the phaistos disc captured the imagination of amateur and professional archaeologists , and many phaistos disc decipherment claims behind the disc 's signs . while it is not clear that it is a script , most attempted decipherments assume that it is ; most additionally assume a syllabary , others an alphabet or logography . attempts at decipherment are generally thought to be unlikely to succeed unless more examples of the signs are found , as it is generally agreed that there is not enough context available for a meaningful analysis . although the phaistos disc is generally accepted as authentic by archaeologists , a few scholars believe that the disc is a forgery or a hoax .
