a brig is a sailing vessel with two square rig masts . during the age of sail , brigs were seen as fast and maneuverable and were used as both naval warships and merchant vessels . they were especially popular in the 18th and early 19th centuries . brigs fell out of use with the arrival of the steam ship because they required a relatively large crew for their small size and were difficult to sail into the wind . their rigging differs from that of a brigantine which has a gaff-rigged mainsail , while a brig has a square mainsail with an additional gaff-rigged spanker behind the mainsail .
