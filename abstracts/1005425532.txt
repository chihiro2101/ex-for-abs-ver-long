thumb a stepper motor , also known as step motor or stepping motor , is a brushless dc electric motor that divides a full rotation into a number of equal steps . the motor 's position can then be commanded to move and hold at one of these steps without any rotary encoder for feedback ( an open-loop controller ) , as long as the motor is carefully sized to the application in respect to torque and speed . switched reluctance motors are very large stepping motors with a reduced pole count , and generally are closed-loop commutated .
