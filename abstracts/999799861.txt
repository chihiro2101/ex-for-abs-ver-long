ghz experiments are a class of physics experiments that may be used to generate starkly contrasting predictions from local hidden variable theory and quantum mechanics , and permit immediate comparison with actual experimental results . a ghz experiment is similar to a bell test experiments , except using three or more entangled particles , rather than two . with specific settings of ghz experiments , it is possible to demonstrate absolute contradictions between the predictions of local hidden variable theory and those of quantum mechanics , whereas tests of bell 's inequality only demonstrate contradictions of a statistical nature . the results of actual ghz experiments agree with the predictions of quantum mechanics . the ghz experiments are named for daniel greenberger , michael a . horne , and anton zeilinger ( ghz ) who first analyzed certain measurements involving four observers and who subsequently ( together with abner shimony ( ghsz ) , upon a suggestion by david mermin ) applied their arguments to certain measurements involving three observers . and references therein
