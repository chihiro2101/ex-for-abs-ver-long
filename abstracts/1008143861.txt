in the battle of vimeiro ( sometimes shown as '' vimiera '' or '' vimeira '' in contemporary british texts ) on 21 august 1808 , the british under general arthur wellesley ( who later became the duke of wellington ) defeated the french under major-general jean-andoche junot near the village of vimeiro , near lisbon , portugal during the peninsular war . this battle put an end to the first french invasion of portugal . four days after the battle of roli√ßa , wellesley 's army was attacked by a french army under general junot near the village of vimeiro . the battle began as a battle of manoeuvre , with french troops attempting to outflank the british left , but wellesley was able to redeploy his army to face the assault . meanwhile , junot sent in two central columns but these were forced back by sustained volleys from troops in line . soon afterwards , the flanking attack was beaten off and junot retreated towards torres vedras having lost 2,000 men and 13 cannon , compared to 700 anglo-portuguese losses . no pursuit was attempted because wellesley was superseded by sir harry burrard and then sir hew dalrymple ( one having arrived during the battle , the second soon after ) .
