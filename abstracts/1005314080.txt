iterative and incremental development is any combination of both iterative design or iterative method and incremental build model for development . usage of the term began in software development , with a long-standing combination of the two terms iterative and incremental having been widely suggested for large development efforts . for example , the 1985 dod-std-2167 dod-std-2167 defense systems software development ( 04 jun 1985 ) on everyspec.com mentions ( in section 4.1.2 ) : '' during software development , more than one iteration of the software development cycle may be in progress at the same time . '' and '' this process may be described as an 'evolutionary acquisition ' or 'incremental build ' approach . '' in software , the relationship between iterations and increments is determined by the overall software development process .
