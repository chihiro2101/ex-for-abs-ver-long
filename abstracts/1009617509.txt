in genetics , an operon is a functioning unit of dna containing a cluster of genes under the control of a single promoter . the genes are transcribed together into an mrna strand and either translated together in the cytoplasm , or undergo splicing to create cistron mrnas that are translated separately , i.e . several strands of mrna that each encode a single gene product . the result of this is that the genes contained in the operon are either expressed together or not at all . several genes must be co-transcribed to define an operon . originally , operons were thought to exist solely in prokaryotes ( which includes organelles like plastids that are derived from bacteria ) , but since the discovery of the first operons in eukaryotes in the early 1990s , more evidence has arisen to suggest they are more common than previously assumed . in general , expression of prokaryotic operons leads to the generation of cistron mrnas , while eukaryotic operons lead to monocistronic mrnas . operons are also found in viruses such as bacteriophages . for example , t7 phages have two operons . the first operon codes for various products , including a special t7 rna polymerase which can bind to and transcribe the second operon . the second operon includes a lysis gene meant to cause the host cell to burst .
