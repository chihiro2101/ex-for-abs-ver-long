in computer graphics , photon mapping is a two-pass global illumination rendering algorithm developed by henrik wann jensen between 1995 and 2001 that approximately solves the rendering equation for integrating radiance at a given point in space . rays from the light source ( like photons ) and rays from the camera are traced independently until some termination criterion is met , then they are connected in a second step to produce a radiance value . the algorithm is used to realistically simulate the interaction of light with different types of objects ( similar to other photorealistic rendering techniques ) . specifically , it is capable of simulating the refraction of light through a transparent material such as glass or water ( including caustics ) , diffuse interreflection between illuminated objects , the subsurface scattering of light in translucent materials , and some of the effects caused by particulate matter such as smoke or water vapor . photon mapping can also be extended to more accurate simulations of light , such as spectral rendering . progressive photon mapping ( ppm ) starts with ray tracing and then adds more and more photon mapping passes to provide a progressively more accurate render . unlike path tracing , bidirectional path tracing , volumetric path tracing , and metropolis light transport , photon mapping is a unbiased rendering , which means that averaging infinitely many renders of the same scene using this method does not converge to a correct solution to the rendering equation . however , it is a consistent method , and the accuracy of a render can be increased by increasing the number of photons . as the number of photons approaches infinity , a render will get closer and closer to the solution of the rendering equation .
