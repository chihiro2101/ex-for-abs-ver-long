to improve motorcycle safety many countries mandate the wearing of personal protective equipment such as protective clothing and helmets . protective clothing may include certain types of jackets , gloves , boots , and pants . jackets meant for motorcyclists are typically made of leather or specialized man-made fabrics like cordura or kevlar . these jackets typically include padding on the elbow , spine , and shoulder regions . this was once quite bulky , but modern technology and materials have made it unobtrusive . gloves are generally made of leather or kevlar and some include carbon fiber knuckle protection . boots , especially those for sport riding , include reinforcement and plastic caps on the ankle and toe areas . pants are usually leather , cordura , or kevlar . except for helmets , none of these items are required by law in any state in the usa , or in any part of the uk but are recommended by many of those who ride . '' off road '' riders wear a range of plastic armour to protect against injury from falling off , hitting other riders and bikes , road debris of leading bikes , and from running into track barriers protecting the public . this armour protects the extremities from breakage and dislocation and the back and chest from strain and broken bones . although fairly efficient , it is of course not always completely effective . many riders wear '' roost protectors '' designed specifically to protect against painful debris from other bikes , but are of no use in a fall or collision .
