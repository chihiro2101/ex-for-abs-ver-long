the human potential movement ( hpm ) arose out of the counterculture movement of the 1960s and formed around the concept of cultivating extraordinary potential that its advocates believe to lie largely untapped in all people . the movement took as its premise the belief that through the development of '' human potential '' , humans can experience an exceptional quality of life filled with happiness , creativity , and fulfillment . as a corollary , those who begin to unleash this assumed potential often find themselves directing their actions within society toward assisting others to release their potential . adherents believe that the net effect of individuals cultivating their potential will bring about positive social change at large .
