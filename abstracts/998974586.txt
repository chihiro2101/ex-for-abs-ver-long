william whiston ( 9 december 166722 august 1752 ) was an english theologian , historian , and mathematician , a leading figure in the popularisation of the ideas of isaac newton . he is now probably best known for helping to instigate the longitude act in 1714 ( and his attempts to win the rewards that it promised ) and his important translations of the antiquities of the jews and other works by josephus ( which are still in print ) . he was a prominent exponent of arianism and wrote a new theory of the earth . whiston succeeded his mentor newton as lucasian professor of mathematics at the university of cambridge . in 1710 he lost the professorship and was expelled from the university as a result of his unorthodox religious views . because whiston recognized the bible as a book of spiritual truth , he rejected the notion of eternal torment in hellfire . he viewed it as absurd and cruel , as well as an insult to god . what especially pitted him against church authorities was his denial of the trinity after extensive research convinced him of the pagan origin of the trinity doctrine .
