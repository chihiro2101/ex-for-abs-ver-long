sunset , also known as sundown , is the daily disappearance of the sun below the horizon due to earth 's rotation . as viewed from the equator , the equinox sun sets exactly due west in both spring and autumn . as viewed from the middle latitudes , the local summer sun sets to the southwest for the northern hemisphere , and to the northwest for the southern hemisphere . the time of sunset is defined in astronomy as the moment when the upper limb of the sun disappears below the horizon . near the horizon , atmospheric refraction causes sunlight rays to be distorted to such an extent that geometrically the solar disk is already about one diameter below the horizon when a sunset is observed . sunset is distinct from twilight , which is divided into three stages , the first being civil twilight , which begins once the sun has disappeared below the horizon , and continues until it descends to 6 degrees below the horizon ; the second phase is nautical twilight , between 6 and 12 degrees below the horizon ; and the third is astronomical twilight , which is the period when the sun is between 12 and 18 degrees below the horizon . dusk is at the very end of astronomical twilight , and is the darkest moment of twilight just before night . night occurs when the sun reaches 18 degrees below the horizon and no longer illuminates the sky . locations further north than the arctic circle and further south than the antarctic circle experience no full sunset or sunrise on at least one day of the year , when the polar day or the polar night persists continuously for 24 hours .
