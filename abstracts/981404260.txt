a roots revival ( folk revival ) is a trend which includes young performers popularizing the traditional musical styles of their ancestors . often , roots revivals include an addition of newly composed songs with socially and politically aware lyrics , as well as a general modernization of the folk sound . the term roots revival is vague , and may not always refer to identical events . characteristics associated with a roots revival include : popularization of previously non-mainstream folk music adaptation of folk styles to pop ( or rock ) structures invention of new formats like bands where only solo acts had existed before introduction of new instruments composition of works by those who perform them , as opposed to folk tunes mostly passed down orally ( see singer-songwriter ) incorporation of politically aware lyrics , often critical of a government , religion or other authority , or society in general . lyrics are the first from the nation to express more than simple desires and problems , and are often seen as the embodiment of a national character or literary tradition ( in comparison to the legendary american songwriter , such composers are often said to be the '' bob dylan '' of a particular variety , as in wannes van de velde is the belgian bob dylan ) roots revival performers will often come from very different social and economic backgrounds compared to the people whose style of music they are popularizing . with such a vague and variable definition , roots revival could be seen as referring to the creation of any kind of pop music industry , though there are countries with well-developed pop traditions that have not had a period referred to as a roots revival ( such as jamaica , india , cuba and kenya ) . for example , homogenized pop has long had its fans in most every country in the world , but many of these nations have created their own indigenous pop styles out of folk music ; this process could be called a roots revival , though in some cases the folk musics in question were still widespread and did not need to be revived .
