literally '' badger '' ; 17 november 1612 â€“ 31 december 1650 ) , formally known as prince rui , was a manchu prince and regent of the early qing dynasty . born in the aisin gioro clan as the 14th son of nurhaci ( the founder of the qing dynasty ) , dorgon started his career in military campaigns against the ming dynasty , mongols and koreans during the reign of his eighth brother , hong taiji , who succeeded their father . after hong taiji 's death in 1643 , he was involved in a power struggle against hong taiji 's eldest son , hooge , over the succession to the throne . both of them eventually came to a compromise by backing out and letting hong taiji 's ninth son , fulin , become the emperor ; fulin was installed on the throne as the shunzhi emperor . dorgon served as prince regent from 1643 to 1650 , throughout the shunzhi emperor 's early reign . in 1645 , he was given the honorary title '' emperor 's uncle and prince-regent '' ; the title was changed to '' emperor 's father and prince-regent '' in 1649 . under dorgon 's regency , qing forces occupied beijing , the capital of the fallen ming dynasty , and gradually conquered the rest of the ming in a series of battles against southern ming and other opposing forces around china . dorgon also introduced the policy of forcing all han chinese men to shave the front of the heads and wear their hair in queues just like the manchus . he died in 1650 during a hunting trip and was posthumously honoured as an emperor even though he was never an emperor during his lifetime . a year after dorgon 's death , however , the shunzhi emperor accused dorgon of several crimes , stripped him of his titles , and ordered his remains to be exhumed and flogged in public . dorgon was posthumously rehabilitated and restored of his honorary titles by the qianlong emperor in 1778 .
