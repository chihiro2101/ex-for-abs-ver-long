the culture of mexico reflects the country 's complex history and is the result of the gradual blending of native culture ( particularly mesoamerican ) with spanish mexican and other mexican cultures . first inhabited more than 10,000 years ago , the cultures that developed in mexico became one of the cradles of civilization . during the 300-year rule by the spanish , mexico was a crossroads for the people and cultures of europe , africa , and asia . the government of independent mexico actively promoted shared cultural traits in order to create a national identity . the culture of an individual mexican is influenced by familial ties , gender , religion , location , and social class , among other factors . in many ways , contemporary life in the cities of mexico has become similar to that in the neighboring united states and in europe , with provincial people conserving traditions more than city dwellers .
