the instrumental temperature record provides the temperature of earth 's climate from the historical network of in situ measurements of surface air temperatures and ocean surface temperatures . data are collected at thousands of meteorological stations , buoys and ships around the globe . the longest-running temperature record is the central england temperature data series , which starts in 1659 . the longest-running quasi-global record starts in 1850 . in recent decades , more extensive sampling of ocean temperatures at various depths allows estimates of ocean heat content , but these samples do not form part of the global surface temperature datasets .
