cupronickel or copper-nickel ( cuni ) is an alloy of copper that contains nickel and strengthening elements , such as iron and manganese . the copper content typically varies from 60 to 90 percent . ( monel is a nickel-copper alloy that contains a minimum of 52 percent nickel . ) despite its high copper content , cupronickel is silver in colour . cupronickel is highly resistant to corrosion by salt water , and is therefore used for piping , heat exchangers and condensers in seawater systems , as well as for marine hardware . it is sometimes used for the propellers , crankshaft , and hulls of high-quality boats . other uses include military equipment and chemical , petrochemical , and electrical industries . sakiewicz p . , nowosielski r . , babilas r . production aspects of inhomogeneous hot deformation in as-cast cuni25 alloy , indian journal of engineering & materials sciences , vol . 22 , august 2015 , pp . 389-398 another common modern use of cupronickel is silver-coloured coins . for this use , the typical alloy has 3:1 copper to nickel ratio , with very small amounts of manganese . in the past , true silver coins were debased with cupronickel .
