bacon 's rebellion was an armed rebellion held by virginia settlers that took place in 1675 through 1676 . it was led by nathaniel bacon against colonial governor william berkeley . it was the first rebellion in the thirteen colonies in which discontented frontiersmen took part ( a somewhat similar uprising in maryland involving john coode and josias fendall took place shortly afterward ) . the alliance between european indentured servants and africans ( a mix of indentured , enslaved , and free blacks ) disturbed the colonial upper class . they responded by hardening the racial caste of slavery in an attempt to divide the two races from subsequent united uprisings with the passage of the virginia slave codes of 1705 . eric foner , give me liberty ! : an american history ( new york : w.w . norton & company , 2009 ) , p . 100 .
