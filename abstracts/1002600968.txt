hoverflies , also called flower flies or syrphid flies , make up the insect family syrphidae . as their common name suggests , they are often seen hovering or nectaring at flowers ; the adults of many species feed mainly on nectar and pollen , while the larvae ( maggots ) eat a wide range of foods . in some species , the larvae are saprotrophs , eating decaying plant and animal matter in the soil or in ponds and streams . in other species , the larvae are insectivores and prey on aphids , thrips , and other plant-sucking insects . aphids alone cause tens of millions of dollars of damage to crops worldwide every year ; because of this , aphid-eating hoverflies are recognized as important predation of pests , and potential agents for use in biological control . some adult syrphid flies are important pollinators . about 6,000 species in 200 genus have been described . hoverflies are common throughout the world and can be found on all continents except antarctica . hoverflies are harmless to most other animals , despite their mimicry of stinging wasps and bees , a mimicry which serves to ward off predators .
