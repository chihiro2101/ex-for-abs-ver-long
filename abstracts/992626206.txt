man of aran is a 1934 irish docufiction ( ethnofiction ) film shot , written and directed by robert j . flaherty about life on the aran islands off the western coast of ireland . it portrays characters living in premodern conditions , documenting their daily routines such as fishing off high cliffs , farming potatoes where there is little soil , and hunting for huge basking sharks to get liver oil for lamps . some situations are fabricated , such as one scene in which the shark fishermen are almost lost at sea in a sudden gale . additionally , the family members shown are not actually related , having been chosen from among the islanders for their photogenic qualities . george stoney 's 1978 documentary how the myth was made , which is included in the special features of the dvd , relates that the aran islanders had not hunted sharks in this way for over fifty years at the time the film was made . man of aran is flaherty 's recreation of culture on the edges of modern society , even though much of the primitive life depicted had been left behind by the 1930s . it is impressive , however , for its drama , for its spectacular cinematography of landscape and seascape , and for its concise editing .
