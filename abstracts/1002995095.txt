uss indiana ( bb-1 ) was the lead ship of her class and the first battleship in the united states navy comparable to foreign battleships of the time . authorized in 1890 and commissioned five years later , she was a small battleship , though with heavy armor and ordnance . the ship also pioneered the use of an intermediate battery . she was designed for coastal defense and as a result , her decks were not safe from high waves on the open ocean . indiana served in the spanish–american war ( 1898 ) as part of the north atlantic squadron . she took part in both the blockade of santiago de cuba and the battle of santiago de cuba , which occurred when the spanish fleet attempted to break through the blockade . although unable to join the chase of the escaping spanish cruisers , she was partly responsible for the destruction of the spanish destroyers plutón and furor . after the war she quickly became obsolete—despite several modernizations—and spent most of her time in commission as a training ship or in the reserve fleet , with her last commission during world war i as a training ship for gun crews . she was decommissioned for the third and final time in january 1919 and was shortly after reclassified coast battleship number 1 so that the name indiana could be reused . she was sunk in shallow water as a target in aerial bombing tests in 1920 and her hull was sold for scrap in 1924 .
