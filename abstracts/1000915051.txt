curia ( latin plural curiae ) in ancient rome referred to one of the original groupings of the citizenry , eventually numbering 30 , and later every roman citizen was presumed to belong to one . while they originally likely had wider powers , see for an ambitious reconstruction . they came to meet for only a few purposes by the end of the republic : to confirm the election of magistrates with imperium , to witness the installation of priests , the making of wills , and to carry out certain adoptions . the term is more broadly used to designate an assembly , council , or court , in which public , official , or religious issues are discussed and decided . lesser curiae existed for other purposes . the word curia also came to denote the places of assembly , especially of the senate . similar institutions existed in other towns and cities of italy . in medieval times , a king 's council was often referred to as a curia . today , the most famous curia is the curia of the roman catholic church , which assists the roman pontiff in the hierarchy of the church . 1983 code of canon law , can . 360
