electrophysiology ( from greek , Ä“lektron , '' amber '' see the electron etymology ; , physis , '' nature , origin '' ; and , -logy ) is the branch of physiology that studies the electrical properties of biological cells and tissues . it involves measurements of voltage changes or electric current or manipulations on a wide variety of scales from single ion channel proteins to whole organs like the heart . in neuroscience , it includes measurements of the electrical activity of neurons , and , in particular , action potential activity . recordings of large-scale electric signals from the nervous system , such as electroencephalography , may also be referred to as electrophysiological recordings . they are useful for electrodiagnosis and monitoring .
