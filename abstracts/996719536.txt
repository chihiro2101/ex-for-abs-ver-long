in signal processing and related disciplines , aliasing is an effect that causes different signals to become indistinguishable ( or aliases of one another ) when sampled . it also often refers to the distortion or artifact that results when a signal reconstructed from samples is different from the original continuous signal . aliasing can occur in signals sampled in time , for instance digital audio , and is referred to as temporal aliasing . it can also occur in spatially sampled signals ( e.g . moir√© patterns in digital images ) ; this type of aliasing is called spatial aliasing . aliasing is generally avoided by applying low pass filters or anti-aliasing filters ( aaf ) to the input signal before sampling and when converting a signal from a higher to a lower sampling rate . suitable reconstruction filtering should then be used when restoring the sampled signal to the continuous domain or converting a signal from a lower to a higher sampling rate . for spatial anti-aliasing , the types of anti-aliasing include fast sample anti-aliasing ( fsaa ) , multisample anti-aliasing , and supersampling .
