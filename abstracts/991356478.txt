the roche lobe is the region around a star in a binary star within which orbiting material is gravity bound to that star . it is an approximately teardrop-shaped region bounded by a critical gravitational equipotential , with the apex of the teardrop pointing towards the other star ( the apex is at the lagrangian point of the system ) . the roche lobe is different from the roche sphere , which approximates the gravitational sphere of influence of one astronomical body in the face of perturbations from a more massive body around which it orbits . it is different from the roche limit , which is the distance at which an object held together only by gravity begins to break up due to tidal forces . the roche lobe , roche limit , and roche sphere are named after the french astronomy Ã©douard roche .
