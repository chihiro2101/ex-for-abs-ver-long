a caudle ( or caudel ) was a hot drink that recurred in various guises throughout british cuisine from the middle ages into victorian times . it was thick and sweet , and seen as particularly suitable and sustaining for invalids and new mothers . at some periods of history , caudle recipes were based on milk and eggs , like eggnog . later variants were more similar to a gruel , a sort of drinkable oatmeal porridge . like the original forms of posset ( a drink of wine and milk , rather than a set dessert ) , a caudle was usually alcoholic .
