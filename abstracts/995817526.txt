the common foreign and security policy ( cfsp ) is the organised , agreed foreign policy of the european union ( eu ) for mainly security and defence diplomacy and actions . cfsp deals only with a specific part of the eu 's external relations , which domains include mainly commercial policy and other areas such as funding to third countries , etc . decisions require unanimity among member states in the council of the european union , but once agreed , certain aspects can be further decided by qualified majority voting . foreign policy is chaired and represented by the eu 's high representative , currently josep borrell . the cfsp sees the nato ( nato ) as responsible for the territorial defence of europe and reconciliation . however , since 1999 , the european union is responsible for implementing missions such as peacekeeping and policing of treaties . a phrase often used to describe the relationship between the eu forces and nato is '' separable , but not separate '' . the same forces and capabilities form the basis of both eu and nato efforts , but portions can be allocated to the european union if necessary .
