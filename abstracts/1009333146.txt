sodium carbonate , , ( also known as washing soda , soda ash and soda crystals ) is the inorganic compound with the formula na 2 co 3 and its various hydrates . all forms are white , water-soluble salts that yield moderately alkaline solutions in water . historically it was extracted from the ashes of plants growing in sodium-rich soils . because the ashes of these sodium-rich plants were noticeably different from ashes of wood ( once used to produce potash ) , sodium carbonate became known as '' soda ash . '' it is produced in large quantities from sodium chloride and limestone by the solvay process .
