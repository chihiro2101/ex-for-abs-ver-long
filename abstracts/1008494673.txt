atp synthase is an protein that catalyzes the formation of the energy storage molecule adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) using adenosine diphosphate ( adp ) and inorganic phosphate ( p i ) . it is classified under ligases as it changes adp by the formation of p-o bond ( phosphodiester bond ) . the overall reaction catalyzed by atp synthase is : adp + p i + 2h + out atp + h 2 o + 2h + in the formation of atp from adp and p i is energetically unfavorable and would normally proceed in the reverse direction . in order to drive this reaction forward , atp synthase couples atp synthesis during cellular respiration to an electrochemical gradient created by the difference in proton ( h + ) concentration across the inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes or the plasma membrane in bacteria . during photosynthesis in plants , atp is synthesized by atp synthase using a proton gradient created in the thylakoid lumen through the thylakoid membrane and into the chloroplast stroma . eukaryotic atp synthases are f-atpases , running '' in reverse '' for an atpase . this article deals mainly with this type . an f-atpase consists of two main subunits , f o and f 1 , which has a rotational motor mechanism allowing for atp production . atp synthase is a molecular machine .
