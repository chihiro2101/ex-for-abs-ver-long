q-switching , sometimes known as giant pulse formation or q-spoiling , is a technique by which a laser can be made to produce a pulsed output beam . the technique allows the production of light pulses with extremely high ( gigawatt ) peak power , much higher than would be produced by the same laser if it were operating in a continuous wave ( constant output ) mode . compared to modelocking , another technique for pulse generation with lasers , q-switching leads to much lower pulse repetition rates , much higher pulse energies , and much longer pulse durations . the two techniques are sometimes applied together . q-switching was first proposed in 1958 by gordon gould , p . 93 . and independently discovered and demonstrated in 1961 or 1962 by r.w . hellwarth and f.j . mcclung using electrically switched kerr cell shutters in a ruby laser .
