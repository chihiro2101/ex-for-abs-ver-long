islamic philosophy is a development in philosophy that is characterised by coming from an islam tradition . two terms traditionally used in the islamic world are sometimes translated as philosophyâ€”falsafa ( literally : '' philosophy '' ) , which refers to philosophy as well as logic , mathematics , and physics ; and kalam ( literally '' speech '' ) , which refers to a rationalist form of islamic theology . early islamic philosophy began with al-kindi in the 2nd century of the islamic calendar ( early 9th century ce ) and ended with averroes ( ibn rushd ) in the 6th century ah ( late 12th century ce ) , broadly coinciding with the period known as the golden age of islam . the death of averroes effectively marked the end of a particular discipline of islamic philosophy usually called the peripatetic islamic school , and philosophical activity declined significantly in western islamic countries such as islamic iberia and north africa . islamic philosophy persisted for much longer in muslim eastern countries , in particular safavid persia , ottoman and mughal empires , where several schools of philosophy continued to flourish : avicennism , averroism , illuminationist philosophy , mystical philosophy , transcendent theosophy , and isfahan philosophy . ibn khaldun , in his muqaddimah , made important contributions to the philosophy of history . interest in islamic philosophy revived during the nahda ( '' awakening '' ) movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , and continues to the present day . islamic philosophy had a major impact in christian europe , where translation of arabic philosophical texts into latin '' led to the transformation of almost all philosophical disciplines in the medieval latin world '' , with a particularly strong influence of muslim philosophers being felt in natural philosophy , psychology and metaphysics .
