pyroelectricity ( from the two greek words pyr meaning fire , and electricity ) is a property of certain crystals which are naturally electrically polarized and as a result contain large electric fields . ashcroft , n . w . & mermin , n . d . solid state physics . ( cengage learning , 1976 ) . pyroelectricity can be described as the ability of certain materials to generate a temporary voltage when they are heated or cooled . charles kittel-8th edition . 2016 . introduction to solid state physics . the change in temperature modifies the positions of the atoms slightly within the crystal structure , such that the polarization of the material changes . this polarization change gives rise to a voltage across the crystal . if the temperature stays constant at its new value , the pyroelectric voltage gradually disappears due to leakage current . the leakage can be due to electrons moving through the crystal , ions moving through the air , or current leaking through a voltmeter attached across the crystal . in this article , the term '' voltage '' is used in the everyday sense , i.e . what a voltmeter measures . this is actually the electrochemical potential , not the electrostatic potential ( galvani potential ) .
