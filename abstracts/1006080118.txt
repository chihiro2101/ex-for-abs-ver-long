the international accounting standards committee ( iasc ) was founded in june 1973 in london at the initiative of sir henry benson , former president of the institute of chartered accountants in england and wales . the iasc was created by national accountancy bodies from a number of countries with a view to harmonizing the international diversity of company reporting practices . between its founding in 1973 and its dissolution in 2001 , it developed a set of international accounting standards ( ias ) that gradually acquired a degree of acceptance in countries around the world . although the iasc came to include some organizations representing preparers and users of financial statements , it largely remained an initiative of the accountancy profession . on 1 april 2001 , it was replaced by the international accounting standards board ( iasb ) , an independent standard-setting body . the iasb adopted the extant corpus of ias which it continued to develop as international financial reporting standards .
