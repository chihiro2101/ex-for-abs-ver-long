a music tracker ( short version tracker ) is a type of music sequencer software for creating music . the music is represented as discrete musical notes positioned in several channels at discrete chronological positions on a vertical timeline . a music tracker 's user interface is usually number based . notes , parameter changes , effects and other commands are entered with the keyboard into a grid of fixed time slots as codes consisting of letters , numbers and hexadecimal digits . separate patterns have independent timelines ; a complete song consists of a master list of repeated patterns . later trackers departed from solely using module files , adding other options both to the sound synthesis ( hosting generic synthesizers and effects or midi output ) and to the sequencing ( midi input and recording ) , effectively becoming general purpose sequencers with a different user interface . in the 2010s , tracker music is still featured in demoscene products for old hardware platforms and demoparties have often separate tracker music competitions . tracker music may also be used in non-commercial games which borrow aesthetics from past decades .
