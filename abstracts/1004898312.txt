magnesium oxide ( mgo ) , or magnesia , is a white hygroscopy solid mineral that occurs naturally as periclase and is a source of magnesium ( see also oxide ) . it has an empirical formula of and consists of a lattice of mg 2+ ions and o 2− ions held together by ionic bonding . magnesium hydroxide forms in the presence of water ( mgo + h 2 o → mg ( oh ) 2 ) , but it can be reversed by heating it to remove moisture . magnesium oxide was historically known as magnesia alba ( literally , the white mineral from magnesia – other sources give magnesia alba as mgco 3 ) , to differentiate it from magnesia negra , a black mineral containing what is now known as manganese . while '' magnesium oxide '' normally refers to mgo , magnesium peroxide mgo 2 is also known as a compound . according to evolutionary crystal structure prediction , mgo 2 is thermodynamically stable at pressures above 116 gpa ( gigapascals ) , and a semiconducting suboxide mg 3 o 2 is thermodynamically stable above 500 gpa . because of its stability , mgo is used as a model system for investigating vibrational properties of crystals .
