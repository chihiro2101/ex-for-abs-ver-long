roles for the er chaperones grp94 , edem and bip have been proposed prior to the 'dislocation ' of rta from the er lumen to the cytosol in a manner that uses components of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation ( erad ) pathway . erad normally removes misfolded er proteins to the cytosol for their destruction by cytosolic proteasomes . dislocation of rta requires er membrane-integral e3 ubiquitin ligase complexes , but rta avoids the ubiquitination that usually occurs with erad substrates because of its low content of lysine residues , which are the usual attachment sites for ubiquitin . thus , rta avoids the usual fate of dislocated proteins ( destruction that is mediated by targeting ubiquitinylated proteins to the cytosolic proteasomes ) . in the mammalian cell cytosol , rta then undergoes triage by the cytosolic molecular chaperones hsc70 and hsp90 and their co-chaperones , as well as by one subunit ( rpt5 ) of the proteasome itself , that results in its folding to a catalytic conformation , which de-purinates ribosomes , thus halting protein synthesis .
