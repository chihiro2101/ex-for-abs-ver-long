vorticism was a london-based modernism art movement formed in 1914 by the writer and artist wyndham lewis . the movement was partially inspired by cubism and was introduced to the public by means of the publication of the vorticist manifesto in blast magazine . familiar forms of representational art were rejected in favour of a geometric style that tended towards a hard-edged abstraction . lewis proved unable to harness the talents of his disparate group of avant-garde artists ; however , for a brief period vorticism proved to be an exciting intervention and an artistic riposte to marinetti ’ s futurism and the post-impressionism of roger fry ’ s omega workshops . for a full account of vorticism see the introductory essay by richard cork in the exhibition catalogue vorticism and its allies ( london : arts council of great britain , 1974 ) , pp . 5–26 . a recent and concise definition is available at the tate ’ s website : vorticist paintings emphasised '' modern life '' as an array of bold lines and harsh colours drawing the viewer 's eye into the centre of the canvas and vorticist sculpture created energy and intensity through '' direct carving '' . as opposed to sculpting in wax to produce casts or using mechanised tools to ‘ translate clay into marble ’ . mark antliff , ‘ sculpural nominalism/anarchist vortex : henri gaudier-brzeska , dora marsden and ezra pound ' , in mark antliff and vivien greene ( eds . ) , the vorticists : manifesto for a modern world ( london : tate publishing , 2010 ) , p . 52 .
