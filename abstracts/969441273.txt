twin earth is a thought experiment proposed by philosophy hilary putnam in his papers '' meaning and reference '' ( 1973 ) and '' the meaning of 'meaning ( 1975 ) . it is meant to serve as an illustration of his argument for semantic externalism , or the view that the meanings of words are not purely psychological . the twin earth thought experiment was one of three examples that putnam offered in support of semantic externalism , the other two being what he called the aluminum-molybdenum case and the beech-elm case . since the publication of these cases , numerous variations on the thought experiment have been proposed by philosophers .
