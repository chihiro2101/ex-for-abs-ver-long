a demilitarized zone , dmz or dz is an area in which treaties or agreements between nations , military powers or contending groups forbid military installations , activities or personnel . a dmz often lies along an established frontier or boundary between two or more military powers or alliances . a dmz may sometimes form a de facto international border , such as the korean demilitarized zone . other examples of demilitarized zones are a iraq-kuwait barrier , antarctica ( preserved for scientific exploration and study ) and outer space ( space more than from the earth 's surface ) . many demilitarized zones are considered neutral territory because neither side is allowed to control it , even for non-combat administration . some zones remain demilitarized after an agreement has awarded control to a state which ( under the dmz terms ) had originally ceded its right to maintain military forces in the disputed territory . it is also possible for powers to agree on the demilitarization of a zone without formally settling their respective territorial claims , enabling the dispute to be resolved by peaceful means such as diplomatic dialogue or an international court . several demilitarized zones have also unintentionally become wildlife preserves because their land is unsafe for construction or less exposed to human disturbances ( including hunting ) . examples include the korean demilitarized zone , the cypriot demilitarized zone ( the green line ) , and the former vietnamese demilitarized zone which divided vietnam into two countries ( north vietnam and south vietnam ) from 21 july 1954 to 2 july 1976 .
