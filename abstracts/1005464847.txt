strike action , also called labor strike , labour strike , or simply strike , is a work stoppage , caused by the mass refusal of employees to work . a strike usually takes place in response to grievance ( labour ) . strikes became common during the industrial revolution , when mass labor became important in factories and mines . in most countries , strike actions were quickly made illegal , as factory owners had far more power than workers . most western countries partially legalized striking in the late 19th or early 20th centuries . strikes are sometimes used to pressure governments to change policies . occasionally , strikes destabilize the rule of a particular political party or ruler ; in such cases , strikes are often part of a broader social movement taking the form of a campaign of civil resistance . notable examples are the 1980 gdańsk shipyard , and the 1981 warning strike , led by lech wałęsa . these strikes were significant in the long campaign of civil resistance for political change in poland , and were an important mobilizing effort that contributed to revolutions of 1989 and the end of communist party rule in eastern europe . aleksander smolar , '' towards 'self-limiting revolution ' : poland 1970–89 '' , in adam roberts and timothy garton ash ( eds . ) , civil resistance and power politics : the experience of non-violent action from gandhi to the present , oxford university press , 2009 , pp . 127–43 . this book contains accounts on certain other strike movements in other countries around the world aimed at overthrowing a regime or a foreign military presence .
