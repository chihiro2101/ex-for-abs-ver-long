a premium bond is a lottery bond issued by the united kingdom government since 1956 . at present it is issued by the government 's national savings and investments agency . the principle behind premium bonds is that rather than the stake being gambled , as in a usual lottery , it is the interest on the bonds that is distributed by a lottery . the bonds are entered in a monthly prize draw and the government promises to buy them back , on request , for their original price . the government pays interest into the bond fund ( 1.00 % per annum since december 2020 ) from which a monthly lottery distributes tax-free prizes to bondholders whose numbers are selected randomly . the machine that generates the numbers is called ernie , for electronic random number indicator equipment . prizes range from £25 to £1,000,000 and ( since december 2020 ) the odds of a £1 bond winning a prize in a given month are 34,500 to 1 . -interest rates ns & i investors can buy bonds at any time and they must be held for a calendar month before they qualify for a prize . numbers are entered in the draw each month , with an equal chance of winning , until the bond is cashed . as of 2019 , each person may own bonds up to £50,000 . since 1 february 2019 , the minimum purchase amount for premium bonds has been £25 . as of december 2019 there are 84.3 billion eligible premium bonds , each having a value of £1 . when introduced to the wider public in 1957 , the only other similar game available in the uk was the football pools , with the national lottery not coming into existence until 1994 . although many avenues of lotteries and other forms of gambling are now available to british adults , premium bonds are held by more than 22 million people , equivalent to about 1 in 3 of the uk population .
