the assize of clarendon was an act of henry ii of england in 1166 that began a transformation of english law and led to jury trial in common law countries worldwide , and that established assize courts . prior systems for deciding the winning party in a case , especially felony , included trial by ordeal , by battle , or compurgation , in which evidence , inspection , and inquiry was made under oath by laymen , knights or ordinary freemen . after the assize of clarendon jury trial developed , though some historians say beginnings of the jury system predate this act . cf . the debate between stubbes , powicke and maitland , 'the jury of presentment and the assize of clarendon ' , n . hurnard ( 1941 ) , ehr vol.56 , no.223 , pp.374-410 . the assize of clarendon did not lead to this change immediately ; recourse to trial by combat was not officially rescinded until 1819 , though by then it had fallen out of use . the assize takes its name from clarendon palace , wiltshire , the royal hunting lodge at which it was promulgated .
