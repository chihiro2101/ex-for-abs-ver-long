a double negative is a construction occurring when two forms of grammatical negation are used in the same sentence . multiple negation is the more general term referring to the occurrence of more than one negative in a clause . in some languages , double negatives cancel one another and produce an affirmative ; in other languages , doubled negatives intensify the negation . languages where multiple negatives affirm each other are said to have negative concord or emphatic negation . portuguese , persian , french , russian , greek , spanish , old english , italian , afrikaans , hebrew , and some dialects of modern english , such as african-american vernacular english , are examples of negative-concord languages , while chinese , latin , german , dutch , japanese , swedish and most modern english dialects are examples of those that do not have negative concord . it is cross-linguistically observed that negative-concord languages are more common than those without . languages without negative concord typically have negative polarity items that are used in place of additional negatives when another negating word already occurs . examples are '' ever '' , '' anything '' and '' anyone '' in the sentence '' i have n't ever owed anything to anyone '' ( cf . '' i have n't never owed nothing to no one '' in negative-concord dialects of english , and '' '' in portuguese , lit . '' never have i owed nothing to no one '' , or '' '' in italian ) . note that negative polarity can be triggered not only by direct negatives such as '' not '' or '' never '' , but also by words such as '' doubt '' or '' hardly '' ( '' i doubt he has ever owed anything to anyone '' or '' he has hardly ever owed anything to anyone '' ) . stylistically , in english , double negatives can sometimes be used for affirmation ( e.g . '' i 'm not feeling not good '' ) , an understatement of the positive ( '' i 'm feeling good '' ) . the rhetorical term for this is litotes .
