the chicxulub crater ; is an impact crater buried underneath the yucatán peninsula in mexico . its center is located offshore near the town of chicxulub , after which the crater is named . it was formed when a large asteroid or comet about in diameter , known as the chicxulub impactor , struck the earth . the date of the impact coincides precisely with the cretaceous–paleogene boundary ( commonly known as the '' k–pg boundary '' ) , slightly more than 66 million years ago , and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide impact winter from the event was the cause of the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event , a mass extinction in which 75 % of plant and animal species on earth became extinct , including all non-bird dinosaurs . the crater is estimated to be in diameter and in depth , well into the continental crust of the region of about depth . it is the second largest confirmed impact structure on earth , and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research . the crater was discovered by antonio camargo and glen penfield , geophysics who had been looking for petroleum in the yucatán peninsula during the late 1970s . penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search . later , through contact with alan hildebrand in 1990 , penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature . evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz , a gravity anomaly , and tektites in surrounding areas . in 2016 , a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the impact crater , hundreds of meters below the current sea floor , to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself . the discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact and its effects . a 2020 study concluded that the chicxulub crater was formed by an inclined ( 45–60° to horizontal ) impact from the northeast .
