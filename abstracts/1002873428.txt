the use of toxic chemicals as weapons dates back thousands of years , but the first large scale use of chemical weapons was during world war i . they were primarily used to demoralize , injure , and kill entrenched defenders , against whom the indiscriminate and generally very slow-moving or static nature of gas clouds would be most effective . the types of weapons employed ranged from disabling chemicals , such as tear gas , to lethal agents like phosgene , chlorine , and mustard gas . this chemical warfare was a major component of the first world war and first total war of the 20th century . the killing capacity of gas was limited , with about ninety thousand fatalities from a total of 1.3 million casualties caused by gas attacks . gas was unlike most other weapons of the period because it was possible to develop countermeasures , such as gas masks . in the later stages of the war , as the use of gas increased , its overall effectiveness diminished . the widespread use of these agents of chemical warfare , and wartime advances in the composition of high explosives , gave rise to an occasionally expressed view of world war i as '' the chemist 's war '' and also the era where weapon of mass destruction were created . the use of poison gas by all major belligerents throughout world war i constituted war crimes as its use violated the 1899 hague declaration concerning asphyxiating gases and the hague convention of 1907 , which prohibited the use of '' poison or poisoned weapons '' in warfare . widespread horror and public revulsion at the use of gas and its consequences led to far less use of chemical weapons by combatants during world war ii .
