a beard is the hair that grows on the chin , upper lip , lower lip , cheeks , and neck of humans and some non-human animals . in humans , usually only pubescent or adult males are able to grow beards . some women with hirsutism , a hormonal condition of excessive hairiness , may develop a beard . throughout the course of history , societal attitudes toward male beards have varied widely depending on factors such as prevailing cultural-religious traditions and the current era 's fashion trends . some religions ( such as islam , traditional christianity , orthodox judaism and sikhism ) have considered a full beard to be absolutely essential for all males able to grow one and mandate it as part of their official dogma . other cultures , even while not officially mandating it , view a beard as central to a man 's virility , exemplifying such virtues as wisdom , strength , sexual prowess and high social status . in cultures where facial hair is uncommon ( or currently out of fashion ) , beards may be associated with poor hygiene or an uncivilized , dangerous demeanor . in countries with colder climates , beards help protect the wearer 's face from the elements .
