standard anatomical terms of location deal unambiguously with the anatomy of animals , including humans . terms used generally derive from latin or greek roots and used to describe something in its standard anatomical position . this position provides a definition of what is at the front ( '' anterior '' ) , behind ( '' posterior '' ) and so on . as part of defining and describing terms , the body is described through the use of anatomical planes and anatomical axis . the meaning of terms that are used can change depending on whether an organism is bipedal or quadrupedal . additionally , for some animals such as invertebrates , some terms may not have any meaning at all ; for example , an animal that is radially symmetrical will have no anterior surface , but can still have a description that a part is close to the middle ( '' proximal '' ) or further from the middle ( '' distal '' ) . international organisations have determined vocabularies that are often used as standard vocabularies for subdisciplines of anatomy , for example , terminologia anatomica for humans , and nomina anatomica veterinaria for animals . these allow parties that use anatomical terms , such as anatomists , veterinarians , and medical doctors to have a standard set of terms to communicate clearly the position of a structure .
