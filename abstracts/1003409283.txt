the mass , a form of sacred music , is a choir composition that sets the invariable portions of the eucharistic liturgy ( principally that of the catholic church , the anglican communion , and lutheranism ) to music . most masses are settings of the liturgy in latin , the liturgical sacred language of the catholic church 's roman rite , but there are a significant number written in the languages of non-catholic countries where vernacular worship has long been the norm . for example , there are many masses ( often called '' communion services '' ) written in english for the church of england . musical masses take their name from the catholic liturgy called '' the mass '' as well . masses can be a cappella , that is , without an independent accompaniment , or they can be accompanied by instrumental obbligatos up to and including a full orchestra . many masses , especially later ones , were never intended to be performed during the celebration of an actual mass .
