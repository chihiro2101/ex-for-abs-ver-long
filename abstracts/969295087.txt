in english law , the benefit of clergy ( latin : privilegium clericale ) was originally a provision by which clergymen could claim that they were outside the jurisdiction of the secular courts and be tried instead in an ecclesiastical court under canon law . various reforms limited the scope of this legal arrangement to prevent its abuse , including branding of a thumb upon a first use , to limit number of invocations for some . eventually the benefit of clergy evolved into a legal fiction in which first-time offenders could receive lesser sentences for some crimes ( the so-called '' clergyable '' ones ) . the legal mechanism was abolished in 1827 with the passage of the criminal law act 1827 .
