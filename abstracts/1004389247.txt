ijmāʿ is an arabic term referring to the consensus or agreement of islamic scholars on a point of islamic law . various schools of thought within islamic jurisprudence may define this consensus to be that of the sahaba only ; or the consensus of the salaf ; or the consensus of the ulema of the muslim world , or scholarly consensus ; or the consensus of all the muslim world , both scholars and laymen . sunni muslims regard ijmā ' as the third fundamental source of sharia , after the qur'an , and the sunnah . the opposite of ijma ( i.e . , lack of consensus on a point of islamic law ) is called ikhtilaf .
