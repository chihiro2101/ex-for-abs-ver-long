a front-side bus ( fsb ) is a computer communication interface ( bus ) that was often used in intel-chip-based computers during the 1990s and 2000s . the ev6 bus served the same function for competing amd cpus . both typically carry data between the central processing unit ( cpu ) and a memory controller hub , known as the northbridge . depending on the implementation , some computers may also have a back-side bus that connects the cpu to the cache . this bus and the cache connected to it are faster than accessing the system memory ( or ram ) via the front-side bus . the speed of the front side bus is often used as an important measure of the performance of a computer . the original front-side bus architecture has been replaced by hypertransport , intel quickpath interconnect or direct media interface in modern volume cpus .
