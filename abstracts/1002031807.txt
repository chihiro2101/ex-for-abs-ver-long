jaffee first appeared in mad in 1955 , one issue after its transformation from comic book format to magazine . when editor harvey kurtzman left in a dispute three issues later , jaffee went with kurtzman . jaffee contributed to kurtzman 's first two post-mad publishing efforts , trump and the creator-owned humbug . in 2008 , the first full reprint of humbug was published as a two-volume set by fantagraphics ; the set includes a newly commissioned cover illustration by jaffee , and a co-interview with jaffee and arnold roth . after humbug folded in 1958 , jaffee brought his unpublished material to mad , which bought the work . '' bill gaines took out every trump and humbug , '' remembered jaffee , '' called me into his office , sat me down on the couch next to him , and went over every issue and said '' which is yours ? '' and as he came to each one , when he saw my stuff , he ok 'd to hire me . ''
