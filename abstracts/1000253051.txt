thumb a heat exchanger is a system used to transfer heat between two or more fluids . heat exchangers are used in both cooling and heating processes . ahmed t . al-sammarraie & kambiz vafai ( 2017 ) heat transfer augmentation through convergence angles in a pipe , numerical heat transfer , part a : applications , 72:3 , 197-214 , the fluids may be separated by a solid wall to prevent mixing or they may be in direct contact . they are widely used in space heating , refrigeration , air conditioning , power stations , chemical plants , petrochemical , oil refinery , natural-gas processing , and sewage treatment . the classic example of a heat exchanger is found in an internal combustion engine in which a circulating fluid known as engine coolant flows through radiator coils and air flows past the coils , which cools the coolant and heats the incoming air . another example is the heat sink , which is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium , often air or a liquid coolant . salimpour , m . r . , al-sammarraie , a . t . , forouzandeh , a . , & farzaneh , m .
