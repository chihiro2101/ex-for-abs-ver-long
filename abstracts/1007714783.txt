and the prairie falcon ( f . & nbsp ; mexicanus ) . this lineage probably diverged from other falcons towards the end of the late miocene or in the early pliocene , about 5–8 & nbsp ; million years ago ( mya ) . as the peregrine-hierofalcon group includes both old world and north american species , it is likely that the lineage originated in western eurasia or africa . its relationship to other falcons is not clear , as the issue is complicated by widespread hybridization confounding mtdna sequence analyses . for example , a genetic lineage of the saker falcon ( f . & nbsp ; cherrug ) is known which originated from a male saker producing fertile young with a female peregrine ancestor , and the descendants further breeding with sakers . today , peregrines are regularly paired in captivity with other species such as the lanner falcon ( f . & nbsp ; biarmicus ) to produce the '' perilanner '' , a somewhat popular bird in falconry as it combines the peregrine 's hunting skill with the lanner 's hardiness , or the gyrfalcon to produce large , strikingly coloured birds for the use of falconers . as can be seen , the peregrine is still genetically close to the hierofalcons , though their lineages diverged in the late pliocene ( maybe some 2.5–2 & nbsp ; mya in the gelasian ) .
