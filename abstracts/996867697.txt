in individualist anarchism discourse , a group entity is usually distinguished from an individual hominid , or animal groups from a single living being of any sexual species . all group-entities are assumed to have certain characteristics in common , most of them sociopathic or destructive to the interests of individuals . some support exists for this political view in modern human sciences . mainstream psychological and sociological research identifies characteristics of human groups including groupthink , peer pressure and mass hysteria that support this view , but fall short of identifying all group-entities as malignant . political science identifies phenomena such as mob rule , mass hysteria and moral panic but of course also studies positive cooperation such as social capital and political virtues but also more debatable phenomena such as the political party . see below for references to fields and authorities supporting this view . users of the term group entity effectively signal a critical view of group actions and skepticism of positive claims for human group achievements , usually preferring to attribute group success to underlying individual leadership and relationships .
