reverse discrimination is discrimination against members of a dominant or majority group , in favor of members of a minority or historically disadvantaged group . groups may be defined in terms of disability , ethnicity , family , gender identity , nationality , race , religion , sex , and sexual orientation , or other factors . this discrimination may seek to redress social inequalities under which minority groups have had less access to privileges enjoyed by the majority group . in such cases it is intended to remove discrimination that minority groups may already face . reverse discrimination can be defined as the unequal treatment of members of the majority groups resulting from preferential policies , as in college admissions or employment , intended to remedy earlier discrimination against minorities . conceptualizing affirmative action as reverse discrimination became popular in the early- to mid-1970s , a time period that focused on under-representation and action policies intended to remedy the effects of past discrimination in both government and the business world .
