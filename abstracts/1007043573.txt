coccidioidomycosis , , commonly known as cocci , valley fever , as well as california fever , desert rheumatism , or san joaquin valley fever , is a mammalian mycosis caused by coccidioides immitis or coccidioides posadasii . coccidioidomycosis is endemic in certain parts of the united states in arizona , california , nevada , new mexico , texas , utah , and northern mexico . c . immitis is a dimorphic saprophytic fungus that grows as a mycelium in the soil and produces a spherule form in the host organism . it resides in the soil in certain parts of the southwestern united states , most notably in california and arizona . it is also commonly found in northern mexico , and parts of central and south america . c . immitis is dormant during long dry spells , then develops as a mold with long filaments that break off into airborne spores when it rains . the spores , known as arthroconidia , are swept into the air by disruption of the soil , such as during construction , farming , or an earthquake . windstorms may also cause epidemics far from endemic areas . in december 1977 , a windstorm in an endemic area around arvin , california led to several hundred cases , including deaths , in non-endemic areas hundreds of miles away . coccidioidomycosis is a common cause of community acquired pneumonia in the endemic areas of the united states . infections usually occur due to inhalation of the arthroconidial spores after soil disruption . the disease is not contagious . in some cases the infection may recur or become chronic .
