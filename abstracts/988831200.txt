in geometry , stellation is the process of extending a polygon in two dimensions , polyhedron in three dimensions , or , in general , a polytope in n dimensions to form a new figure . starting with an original figure , the process extends specific elements such as its edges or face planes , usually in a symmetrical way , until they meet each other again to form the closed boundary of a new figure . the new figure is a stellation of the original . the word stellation comes from the latin stellƒÅtus , '' starred '' , which in turn comes from latin stella , '' star '' .
