in economics , an absentee landlord is a person who owns and rents out a profit-earning property , but does not live within the property 's local economic region . the term '' absentee ownership '' was popularised by economist thorstein veblen 's 1923 book of the same name , absentee ownership . when used in a local context , the term refers to a landlord of a house or other real estate , who leases the property to tenants , but fails to ensure that proper maintenance is done on it , or does only the minimum required by law ( the term slumlord is also used to describe such a person ) . this , in turn , leads to what may appear to be abandoned buildings , causing significantly lowered property values and urban blight . overall , tax policy seems to favour absentee ownership . however , some jurisdictions seek to extract money from absentee owners by taxing land . absentee ownership has sometimes put the absentee owners at risk of loss .
