a co-cathedral is a cathedral church which shares the function of being a bishop 's seat , or cathedra , with another cathedral , often in another city ( usually a former see , anchor city of the metropolitan area or the civil capital ) . instances of this occurred in england before the protestant reformation in the dioceses of 'bath and wells ' , and of 'coventry and lichfield ' . these two dioceses were each named for both cities that served as bishop 's seats . as per march 2020 , the catholic church had 322 co-cathedrals , mainly in europe ( 140 in italy alone ) . many are former cathedrals , but even if still in use , those often are not granted co-cathedral status . often the diocese with one or more co-cathedrals also has a multiple ( '' hyphenated '' ) name reflecting these , but some have a co-cathedral not mentioned in the title while other former see titles may also be preserved without having a co-cathedral . sometimes the first-named city does not have the main cathedral ( actual see ) but boasts another distinction such as being a national capital or having an august ecclesiastical past .
