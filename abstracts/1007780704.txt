lucius junius brutus ; classical latin : /ˈluː.ki.us ˈɫ̪uː.ki.ʊs 'juː.ni.us 'bruː.tus/ ) is the semi-legendary founder of the roman republic , and traditionally one of its first consuls in 509 bc . he was reputedly responsible for the expulsion of his uncle the roman king tarquinius superbus after the suicide of lucretia , which led to the overthrow of the roman monarchy . he was involved in the abdication of fellow consul tarquinius collatinus , and executed two of his sons for plotting the restoration of the tarquins . he was claimed as an ancestor of the roman junia gens , including decimus junius brutus and marcus junius brutus , the most famous of julius caesar 's assassins . traditions about his life may have been fictional , and some scholars argue that it was the etruscan king porsenna who overthrew tarquinius . the plebs status of the junia gens has also raised doubts about his position as a consul and the alleged initial patrician domination of the office . depicted as the nephew of tarquinius , he may have symbolized the internal tensions that occurred during the transition between the monarchy and the republic .
