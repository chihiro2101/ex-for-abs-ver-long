in mathematics and physics , a brachistochrone curve , or curve of fastest descent , is the one lying on the plane between a point a and a lower point b , where b is not directly below a , on which a bead slides frictionlessly under the influence of a uniform gravitational field to a given end point in the shortest time . the problem was posed by johann bernoulli in 1696 . the brachistochrone curve is the same shape as the tautochrone curve ; both are cycloids . however , the portion of the cycloid used for each of the two varies . more specifically , the brachistochrone can use up to a complete rotation of the cycloid ( at the limit when a and b are at the same level ) , but always starts at a cusp . in contrast , the tautochrone problem can only use up to the first half rotation , and always ends at the horizontal . stewart , james .
