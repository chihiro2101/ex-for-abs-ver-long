the germ theory of disease is the currently accepted scientific theory for many diseases . it states that microorganisms known as pathogens or '' germs '' can lead to disease . these small organisms , too small to see without magnification , invade humans , other animals , and other living hosts . their growth and reproduction within their hosts can cause disease . '' germ '' may refer to not just a bacterium but to any type of microorganism , such as protists or fungi , or even non-living pathogens that can cause disease , such as viruses , prions , or viroids . diseases caused by pathogens are called infectious diseases . even when a pathogen is the principal cause of a disease , environmental and hereditary factors often influence the severity of the disease , and whether a potential host individual becomes infected when exposed to the pathogen . basic forms of germ theory were proposed in the late middle ages by physicians including ibn sina in 1025 , ibn khatima and ibn al-khatib in the 14th century , girolamo fracastoro in 1546 , and expanded upon by marcus von plenciz in 1762 . however , such views were held in disdain in europe , where galen miasma theory remained dominant among scientists and doctors . by the early 19th century , smallpox vaccination was commonplace in europe , though doctors were unaware of how it worked or how to extend the principle to other diseases . similar treatments had been prevalent in india from just before ad 1000 . a transitional period began in the late 1850s with the work of louis pasteur . this work was later extended by robert koch in the 1880s . by the end of that decade , the miasma theory was struggling to compete with the germ theory of disease . viruses were initially discovered in the 1890s . eventually , a '' golden era '' of bacteriology ensued , during which the germ theory quickly led to the identification of the actual organisms that cause many diseases .
