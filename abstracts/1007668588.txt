the aire and calder navigation is the canalised section of the river aire and calder in west yorkshire , england . the first improvements to the rivers above knottingley were completed in 1704 when the aire was made navigable to leeds and the calder to wakefield , by the construction of 16 locks . lock sizes were increased several times , as was the depth of water , to enable larger boats to use the system . the aire below haddlesey was bypassed by the opening of the selby canal in 1778 . a canal from knottingley to the new docks and new town at goole provided a much shorter route to the river ouse from 1826 . the new junction canal was constructed in 1905 , to link the system to the river don navigation , by then part of the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation . steam tugs were introduced in 1831 . in the 1860s , compartment boats were introduced , later called tom puddings , from which coal was unloaded into ships by large hydraulic hoists . this system enabled the canal to carry at its peak more than 1.5 million tons of coal per year , and was not abandoned until 1986 . to handle trains of compartments , many of the locks were lengthened to . although much of the upper reaches are now designated as leisure routes , there is still significant commercial traffic on the navigation . 300,000 tons were carried in 2007 , although most of the traffic is now petroleum and gravel , rather than the coal which kept the navigation profitable for 150 years .
