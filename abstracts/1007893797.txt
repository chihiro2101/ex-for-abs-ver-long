the norwegian forest cat or is a breed of domestic cat originating in northern europe . this natural breed is adapted to a very cold climate , with a top coat of glossy , long , water-shedding hair and a woolly undercoat for insulation . although this is uncertain , the breed 's ancestors may have been a landrace of short-haired cats brought to norway by the vikings around 1000 ad , who may also have brought with them long-haired cats , like those ancestral to the modern siberian and turkish angora . during world war ii , the breed became nearly extinct until efforts by the norwegian forest cat club helped the breed by creating an official breeding program . it was registered as a breed with the european fédération internationale féline in the 1970s , when a local cat fancier , carl-fredrik nordane , took notice of the breed and made efforts to register it . currently , the norwegian forest breed is very popular in norway , denmark , sweden , iceland and france . it is a big , strong cat , similar to the maine coon breed , with long legs , a bushy tail and a sturdy body . the breed is very good at climbing , since they have strong claws . the lifespan is usually 14 to 16 years , though kidney and heart diseases have been reported in the breed . specifically in this breed , complex rearrangements of glycogen branching enzyme ( gbe1 ) can cause a perinatal hypoglycaemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type iv .
