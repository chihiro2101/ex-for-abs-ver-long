tsetse , or , sometimes spelled tzetze and also known as tik-tik flies , are large biting flies that inhabit much of tropical africa . tsetse flies include all the species in the genus glossina , which are placed in their own family , glossinidae . the tsetse are obligate parasites that live by feeding on the blood of vertebrate animals . tsetse have been extensively studied because of their role in transmitting disease . they have a prominent economic impact in sub-saharan africa as the biological vectors of trypanosomes , which cause african trypanosomiasis and animal trypanosomiasis . tsetse are multivoltine and long-lived , typically producing about four broods per year , and up to 31 broods over their lifespans . tsetse can be distinguished from other large flies by two easily observed features . tsetse fold their wings completely when they are resting so that one wing rests directly on top of the other over their abdomens . tsetse also have a long proboscis , which extends directly forward and is attached by a distinct bulb to the bottom of their heads . fossilized tsetse have been recovered from florissant fossil beds in colorado , laid down some 34 million years ago . florissant fossil beds national monument : explore the world of florissant paleontology . twenty-three extant species of tsetse flies are known from africa . tsetse were absent from much of southern and eastern africa until colonial times . the accidental introduction of rinderpest in 1887 killed most of the cattle in these parts of africa and the resulting famine removed much of the human population . thorny bush ideal for tsetse quickly grew up where there had been pasture , and was repopulated by wild mammals . tsetse and sleeping sickness soon colonised the whole region , effectively excluding the reintroduction of farming and animal husbandry . sleeping sickness has been described by some conservationists as '' the best game warden in africa '' .
