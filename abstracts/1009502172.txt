book burning is the deliberate destruction by fire of books or other written materials , usually carried out in a public context . the burning of books represents an element of censorship and usually proceeds from a cultural , religious , or political opposition to the materials in question . in some cases , the destroyed works are irreplaceable and their burning constitutes a severe loss to cultural heritage . examples include the burning of books and burying of scholars under china 's qin dynasty ( 213â€“210 bce ) , the obliteration of the house of wisdom ( 1258 ) , the destruction of aztec codices by itzcoatl ( 1430s ) , the burning of maya codices on the order of bishop diego de landa ( 1562 ) , and the burning of jaffna public library in sri lanka ( 1981 ) . in other cases , such as the nazi book burnings , copies of the destroyed books survive , but the instance of book burning becomes emblematic of a harsh and oppressive regime which is seeking to censor or silence some aspect of prevailing culture . book burning can be an act of contempt for the book 's contents or author , and the act is intended to draw wider public attention to this opinion . art destruction is related to book burning , both because it might have similar cultural , religious , or political connotations , and because in various historical cases , books and artworks were destroyed at the same time . in modern times , other forms of media , such as gramophone record , video , and cds have also been burned , shredded , or crushed . when the burning is widespread and systematic , destruction of books and media can become a significant component of cultural genocide .
