the united states one-cent coin ( symbol : ¢ ) , often called the penny , is a unit of currency equaling one one-hundredth of a united states dollar . it has been the lowest-value physical unit of u.s . currency since the abolition of the half-cent in 1857 ( the abstract mill , which has never been minted , equal to a tenth of a cent , continues to see limited use in the fields of taxation and finance ) . the first u.s . cent was fugio cent , and the cent has been issued primarily as a copper or copper-plated coin throughout its history . its obverse has featured the profile of president abraham lincoln since 1909 , the century of his birth . from 1959 ( the sesquicentennial of lincoln 's birth ) to 2008 , the reverse featured the lincoln memorial . four different reverse designs in 2009 honored lincoln 's 200th birthday and a new , '' permanent '' reverse – the union shield – was introduced in 2010 . the coin is 0.75 & nbsp ; inches ( 19.05 & nbsp ; mm ) in diameter and 0.0598 & nbsp ; inches ( 1.52 & nbsp ; mm ) in thickness . its weight has varied , depending upon the composition of metals used in its production ( see further below ) . the u.s . mint 's official name for the coin is '' cent '' and the u.s . treasury 's official name is '' one cent piece '' . the colloquial term penny derives from the penny ( british decimal coin ) , which occupies a similar place in the british system . pennies is the plural form ( not to be confused with pence , which refers to the penny ) . in the early 2010s the price of metal used to make pennies rose to a noticeable cost to the mint which peaked at more than 0.02 , a negative seigniorage , for the 0.01 face-value coin . this pushed the mint to look for alternative metals again for the coin , and also brought the penny debate in the united states into more focus . there are currently no firm plans to do so .
