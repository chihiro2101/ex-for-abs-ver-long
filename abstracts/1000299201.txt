the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis ( hpa axis or htpa axis ) is a complex set of direct influences and feedback interactions among three components : the hypothalamus , the pituitary gland ( a pea-shaped structure located below the thalamus ) , and the adrenal ( also called '' suprarenal '' ) glands ( small , conical organs on top of the kidneys ) . these organs and their interactions constitute the hpa axis , a major neuroendocrine system that controls reactions to stress and regulates many body processes , including digestion , the immune system , mood and emotions , sexuality , and energy storage and expenditure . it is the common mechanism for interactions among glands , hormones , and parts of the midbrain that mediate the general adaptation syndrome ( gas ) . while steroid hormones are produced mainly in vertebrates , the physiological role of the hpa axis and corticosteroids in stress response is so fundamental that analogous systems can be found in invertebrates and monocellular organisms as well . the hpa axis , hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis ( hpg ) , hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis ( hpt ) , and the hypothalamic–neurohypophyseal system are the four major neuroendocrine systems through which the hypothalamus and pituitary direct neuroendocrine function .
