field marshal fitzroy james henry somerset , 1st baron raglan , ( 30 september 1788 â€“ 28 june 1855 ) , known before 1852 as lord fitzroy somerset , was a british army officer . when a junior officer , he served in the peninsular war and the waterloo campaign , latterly as military secretary to the duke of wellington . he also took part in politics as tory member of parliament for truro , before becoming master-general of the ordnance . he became commander of the british troops sent to the crimea in 1854 : his primary objective was to defend istanbul , and he was also ordered to besiege the russian port of sevastopol . after an early success at the battle of alma , a failure to deliver orders with sufficient clarity caused the fateful charge of the light brigade at the battle of balaclava . despite further success at the battle of inkerman , a poorly coordinated allied assault on sevastopol in june 1855 was a complete failure . raglan died later that month , after suffering from dysentery and depression .
