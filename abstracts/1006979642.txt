eudaimonia ( greek : εὐδαιμονία ; sometimes anglicized as eudaemonia or eudemonia , is a greek word commonly translated as 'happiness ' or 'welfare ' ; however , more accurate translations have been proposed to be 'human flourishing , prosperity ' daniel n . robinson . 1989 . aristotle 's psychology . new york : columbia university press . , . and 'blessedness' . simon critchley . 2019 . tragedy , the greeks , and us . p 140 . in the work of aristotle , eudaimonia ( based on older greek tradition ) was used as the term for the highest human good , and so it is the aim of practical philosophy , including ethics and political philosophy , to consider ( and also experience ) what it really is , and how it can be achieved . it is thus a central concept in aristotelian ethics and subsequent hellenistic philosophy , along with the terms aretē ( most often translated as 'virtue ' or 'excellence ' ) and phronesis '' ( 'practical or ethical wisdom ' ) . discussion of the links between ēthikē aretē ( virtue of character ) and eudaimonia ( happiness ) is one of the central concerns of ancient ethics , and a subject of much disagreement . as a result , there are many varieties of eudaimonism .
