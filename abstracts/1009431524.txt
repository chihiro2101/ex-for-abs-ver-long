christine margaret keeler ( 22 february 1942 – 4 december 2017 ) was an english model and showgirl . her meeting at a dance-club with society osteopath stephen ward drew her into fashionable circles . at the height of the cold war , she became sexually involved with a married government minister , john profumo , as well as with a soviet naval attaché , yevgeny ivanov . a shooting incident between two of her other lovers caused the press to investigate her , revealing that her affairs could be threatening national security . in the house of commons , profumo denied any improper conduct but later admitted that he had lied . this incident discredited the conservative government of harold macmillan in 1963 , in what became known as the profumo affair . keeler was alleged to have been a prostitute – which was not a criminal offence . ward was , however , found guilty of being her pimp – a trial was instigated after the embarrassment caused to the government . the trial has since been considered a miscarriage of justice ; a charade of the establishment to protect itself .
