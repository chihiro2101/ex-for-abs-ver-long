in babylonian religion , tiamat ( or , greek : θαλάττη thaláttē ) ancient mesopotamian gods and goddesses – tiamat ( goddess ) is a primordial water god , mating with abzu , the god of the groundwater , to produce younger gods . she is the symbol of the chaos of primordial creation . she is referred to as a woman , and described as '' the glistening one . '' it is suggested that there are two parts to the tiamat mythos , the first in which tiamat is a creator goddess , through a hieros gamos between different waters , peacefully creating the cosmos through successive generations . in the second chaoskampf tiamat is considered the monstrous embodiment of primordial chaos . some sources identify her with images of a sea serpent or dragon . such as in the enûma elish , the babylonian epic of creation , she gives birth to the first generation of deities ; her husband , apsu , correctly assuming they are planning to kill him and usurp his throne , later makes war upon them and is killed . enraged , she also wars upon her husband 's murderers , taking on the form of a massive sea dragon . she is then slain by enki 's son , the storm-god marduk , but not before she had brought forth the monsters of the mesopotamian pantheon , including the first dragons , whose bodies she filled with '' poison instead of blood '' . marduk then forms the heavens and the earth from her divided body .
