the geoid is the shape that the ocean surface would take under the influence of the gravity and rotation of earth alone , if other influences such as winds and tides were absent . this surface is extended through the continents ( such as with very narrow hypothetical canals ) . according to gauss , who first described it , it is the '' mathematical figure of the earth '' , a smooth but irregular surface whose shape results from the uneven distribution of mass within and on the surface of earth . it can be known only through extensive gravitational measurements and calculations . despite being an important concept for almost 200 years in the history of geodesy and geophysics , it has been defined to high precision only since advances in satellite geodesy in the late 20th century . all points on a geoid surface have the same effective potential ( the sum of gravity potential energy and centrifugal potential energy ) . the force of gravity acts everywhere perpendicular to the geoid , meaning that plumb bob point perpendicular and water levels parallel to the geoid if only gravity and rotational acceleration were at work . the surface of the geoid is higher than the reference ellipsoid wherever there is a positive gravity anomaly ( mass excess ) and lower than the reference ellipsoid wherever there is a negative gravity anomaly ( mass deficit ) .
