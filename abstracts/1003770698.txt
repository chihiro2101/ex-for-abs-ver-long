the cave bear ( ursus spelaeus ) was a species of bear that lived in europe and asia during the pleistocene and became extinct about 24,000 years ago during the last glacial maximum . both the word '' cave '' and the scientific name spelaeus are used because fossils of this species were mostly found in cave . this reflects the views of experts that cave bears may have spent more time in caves than the brown bear , which uses caves only for hibernation .
