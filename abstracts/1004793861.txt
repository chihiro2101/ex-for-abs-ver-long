supply-side economics is a macroeconomic theory that postulates economic growth can be most effectively fostered by tax cuts and deregulation . according to supply-side economics , consumers will benefit from greater supplies of goods and services at lower prices , and employment will increase . demand-side economics opposes this theory . a basis of supply-side economics is the laffer curve , a theoretical relationship between rates of taxation and government revenue . the laffer curve suggests that when the tax level is too high , lower tax rates will boost government revenue through higher economic growth . the term '' supply-side economics '' was thought for some time to have been coined by journalist jude wanniski in 1975 , but according to robert d . atkinson the term '' supply side '' was first used in 1976 by herbert stein ( a former economic adviser to president richard nixon ) and only later that year was this term repeated by jude wanniski . the term alludes to ideas of economists robert mundell and arthur laffer .
