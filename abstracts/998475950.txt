the sharpless epoxidation reaction is an enantiomer chemical reaction to prepare 2,3-epoxyalcohols from primary and secondary allyl alcohols . the stereochemistry of the resulting epoxide is determined by the enantiomer of the chiral tartrate diester ( usually diethyl tartrate or diisopropyl tartrate ) employed in the reaction . the oxidizing agent is tert-butyl hydroperoxide . enantioselectivity is achieved by a catalyst formed from titanium isopropoxide and diethyl tartrate . only 5–10 & nbsp ; mol % of the catalyst in the presence of 3å molecular sieves ( 3å ms ) is necessary . the success of the sharpless epoxidation can be attributed to five major aspects . first , epoxides can be easily converted into diols , aminoalcohols , and ethers , so formation of chiral epoxides is important in the synthesis of natural products . second , substrate scope is large , including many primary and secondary allylic alcohols . third , the products of the sharpless epoxidation frequently have enantiomeric excesses above 90 % . fourth , the products of the sharpless epoxidation are predictable . finally , the reactants for the sharpless epoxidation are commercially available and relatively inexpensive . several reviews have been published . k . barry sharpless shared the 2001 nobel prize in chemistry for his work on asymmetric oxidations . the prize was shared with william s . knowles and ryōji noyori .
