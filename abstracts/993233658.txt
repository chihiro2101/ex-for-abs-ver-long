sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation ( also called the sharpless bishydroxylation ) is the chemical reaction of an alkene with osmium tetroxide in the presence of a chiral quinine ligand to form a vicinal diol . the reaction has been applied to alkenes of virtually every substitution , often high enantioselectivities are realized . asymmetric dihydroxylation reactions are also highly site selective , providing products derived from reaction of the most electron-rich double bond in the substrate . thumb it is common practice to perform this reaction using a catalytic amount of osmium tetroxide , which after reaction is regenerated with reoxidants such as potassium ferricyanide or n-methylmorpholine n-oxide . this dramatically reduces the amount of the highly toxic and very expensive osmium tetroxide needed . these four reagents are commercially available premixed ( '' ad-mix '' ) . the mixture containing ( dhq ) 2 -phal is called ad-mix-α , and the mixture containing ( dhqd ) 2 -phal is called ad-mix-β . such chiral diols are important in organic synthesis . the introduction of chirality into nonchiral reactants through usage of chiral catalysts is an important concept in organic synthesis . this reaction was developed principally by k . barry sharpless building on the already known racemic upjohn dihydroxylation , for which he was awarded a share of the 2001 nobel prize in chemistry .
