japanese folktales are an important cultural aspect of japan . in commonplace usage , they signify a certain set of well-known classic tales , with a vague distinction of whether they fit the rigorous definition of '' folktale '' or not among various types of folklore . the admixed impostors are literate written pieces , dating back to the muromachi period ( 14th-16th centuries ) or even earlier times in the middle ages . these would not normally qualify for the english description '' folktales '' ( i.e . , pieces collected from oral tradition among the populace ) . in a more stringent sense , '' japanese folktales '' refers to orally transmitted folk narrative . systematic collection of specimens was pioneered by the folklorist kunio yanagita . yanagita disliked the word , a coined term directly translated from '' folktale '' ( yanagita stated that the term was not familiar to actual old folk he collected folktales from , and was not willing to '' go along '' with the conventions of other countries . yanagita , '' preface to the 1960 edition '' , appended to nihon no mukashibanashi ( folk tales of japan ) , shinchosha , 1983 , p.175 ) he therefore proposed the use of the term to apply to all creative types of folktales ( i.e . , those that are not '' legendary '' types which are more of a reportage ) .
