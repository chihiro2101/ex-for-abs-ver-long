anarcho-pacifism , also referred to as anarchist pacifism and pacifist anarchism , is an anarchist school of thought that advocates for the use of peaceful , non-violent forms of resistance in the struggle for social change . anarcho-pacifism rejects the principle of violence which is seen as a form of power and therefore as contradictory to key anarchist ideals such as the rejection of hierarchy and dominance . many anarcho-pacifists are also christian anarchists , who reject war and the use of violence . anarcho-pacifists do not reject the use of non-violent revolutionary action against capitalism and the state with the purpose of establishing a peaceful voluntarist society . the main early influences were the philosophies of henry david thoreau and leo tolstoy while later the ideas of mahatma gandhi gained significance . anarcho-pacifist movements primarily emerged in the netherlands , russia , the united kingdom and the united states before and during world war ii .
