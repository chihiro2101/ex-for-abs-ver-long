maxims of equity are legal maxims that serve as a set of general principles or rules which are said to govern the way in which equity operates . they tend to illustrate the qualities of equity , in contrast to the common law , as a more flexible , responsive approach to the needs of the individual , inclined to take into account the parties â€™ conduct and worthiness . they were developed by the english court of chancery and other courts that administer equity jurisdiction , including the law of trusts . although the most fundamental and time honored of the maxims , listed on this page , are often referred to on their own as the 'maxims of equity ' or 'the equitable maxims ' , the first equitable maxim is 'equity delights in equality ' or equity is equality like other kinds of legal maxims or principles , they were originally , and sometimes still are , expressed in latin .
