john pym ( 20 may 1584 â€“ 8 december 1643 ) was an england politician , who helped establish the foundations of parliament of england . one of the five members whose attempted arrest in january 1642 sparked the first english civil war , his use of procedure to outmanoeuvre opponents was unusual for the period and he was respected by contemporaries rather than admired . in 1895 , the political historian goldwin smith described him as '' the greatest member of parliament that ever lived '' . his father died when he was seven months old , and pym was brought up by his stepfather sir anthony rous , inheriting his puritan views and deep opposition to the reforms of archbishop william laud . he was also a leading member of the providence island company , an attempt to establish a puritan colony in central america . described as ' a true revolutionary ' , he led the opposition to arbitrary rule under first james i , then charles i . his leadership in the early stages of the war was essential to the parliamentarian cause , particularly his role in negotiating the solemn league and covenant with the scots covenanters ; his death from cancer in december 1643 was seen as a major blow . originally buried in westminster abbey , after the stuart restoration in 1660 , his body was dumped in a pit at nearby st margaret 's , westminster along with those of other parliamentary leaders . although his reputation later suffered in comparison to less complex figures like john hampden and viscount falkland , he is now viewed as an astute politician and effective speaker , whose ideas and language were adapted by patriot ( american revolution ) and 19th century american liberals .
