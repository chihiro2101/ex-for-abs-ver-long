in law , certiorari is a legal process to seek judicial review of a decision of a lower court or government agency . certiorari comes from the name of an english prerogative writ , issued by a superior court to direct that the record of the lower court be sent to the superior court for review . the term is latin for '' to be made certain '' , and comes from the opening line of such writs , which traditionally began with the latin words '' certiorari volumus . '' ( '' we wish to be made certain . '' ) . certiorari was inherited as part of english common law by the countries in the commonwealth of nations and by the united states . it has subsequently evolved in the legal system of each nation , as court decisions and statutory amendments are made . in modern law , certiorari is recognized in many jurisdictions , including english law ( now called '' quashing order '' ) , canada , india , ireland , the philippines and the united states . with the expansion of administrative law in the 19th and 20th centuries , the writ of certiorari has gained broader use in many countries , to review the decisions of administrative bodies as well as lower courts .
