pseudohistory is a form of pseudoscholarship that attempts to distort or misrepresent the recorded history , often using methods resembling those used in legitimate history . the related term cryptohistory is applied to a pseudohistory based upon or derived from the superstitions inherent to occultism . pseudohistory is related to pseudoscience and pseudoarchaeology and usage of the terms may occasionally overlap . although pseudohistory comes in many forms , scholars have identified many features that tend to be common in pseudohistorical works . one such feature is that pseudohistory is nearly always motivated by a contemporary political , religious , or personal agenda . pseudohistory also frequently presents a big lie or sensational claims about historical facts which would require the radical revision ( re-writing ) of the historical record . another very common feature of pseudohistory is the assumption that there is a conspiracy among scholars to suppress the '' true '' history in favor of '' mainstream history '' , which is commonly corroborated by elaborate conspiracy theories . works of pseudohistory often rely exclusively on sources that appear to support the thesis being promoted while ignoring sources that contradict it . many works of pseudohistory treat myths , legends , and other unreliable sources as literal historical truth while ignoring or dismissing evidence to the contrary . sometimes a work of pseudohistory may adopt a position of extreme skepticism , sometimes insisting that there is really no such thing as historical truth and that any hypothesis is just as good as any other . many works of pseudohistory conflate mere possibility with actuality , assuming that if something could have happened , then it did .
