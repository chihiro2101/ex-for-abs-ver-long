royal assent is the method by which a monarch formally approves an act of the legislature , either directly or through an official acting on the monarch 's behalf . in some jurisdictions , royal assent is equivalent to promulgation , while in others that is a separate step . under a modern constitutional monarchy , royal assent is considered little more than a formality . even in nations such as the united kingdom , norway and liechtenstein which still , in theory , permit their monarch to withhold assent to laws , the monarch almost never does so , except in a dire political emergency or on advice of government . while the power to veto by withholding royal assent was once exercised often by european monarchs , such an occurrence has been very rare since the eighteenth century . royal assent is typically associated with elaborate ceremony . in the united kingdom the sovereign may appear personally in the house of lords or may appoint lords commissioners , who announce that royal assent has been granted at a ceremony held at the palace of westminster for this purpose . however , royal assent is usually granted less ceremonially by letters patent . in other nations , such as australia , the governor-general ( as the monarch 's representative ) merely signs a bill . in canada , the governor general may give assent either in person at a ceremony in the senate or by a written declaration notifying parliament of their agreement to the bill .
