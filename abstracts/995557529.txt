magical thinking in various forms is a cultural universal and an important aspect of religion . magic is prevalent in all societies , regardless of whether they have organized religion or more general systems of animism or shamanism . religion and magic became conceptually separated with the development of western monotheism , where the distinction arose between supernatural events sanctioned by mainstream religious doctrine ( miracles ) and magic rooted in folk belief or occult speculation . in pre-monotheistic religious traditions , there is no fundamental distinction between religious practice and magic ; tutelary deities concerned with magic are sometimes called hermetic deities or spirit guides .
