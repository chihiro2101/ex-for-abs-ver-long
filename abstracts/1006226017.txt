transcription in the linguistic sense is the systematic representation of language in written form . the source can either be utterances ( speech or sign language ) or preexisting text in another writing system . transcription should not be confused with translation , which means representing the meaning of a source-language text in a target language ( e.g . los angeles into the angels ) or with transliteration which means representing the spelling of a text from one script to another . in the academic discipline of linguistics , transcription is an essential part of the methodologies of ( among others ) phonetics , conversation analysis , dialectology , and sociolinguistics . it also plays an important role for several subfields of speech technology . common examples for transcriptions outside academia are the proceedings of a court hearing such as a criminal trial ( by a court reporter ) or a physician 's recorded voice notes ( medical transcription ) . this article focuses on transcription in linguistics .
