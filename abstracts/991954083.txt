magnetoencephalography ( meg ) is a functional neuroimaging technique for mapping brain activity by recording magnetic fields produced by electric current occurring naturally in the brain , using very sensitive magnetometers . arrays of squids ( superconducting quantum interference devices ) are currently the most common magnetometer , while the serf ( spin exchange relaxation-free ) magnetometer is being investigated for future machines . applications of meg include basic research into perceptual and cognitive brain processes , localizing regions affected by pathology before surgical removal , determining the function of various parts of the brain , and neurofeedback . this can be applied in a clinical setting to find locations of abnormalities as well as in an experimental setting to simply measure brain activity .
