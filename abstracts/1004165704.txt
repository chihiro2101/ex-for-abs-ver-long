in internet activism , hacktivism , or hactivism ( a portmanteau of hack and activism ) , is the use of computer-based techniques such as hacking as a form of civil disobedience to promote a political agenda or social change . with roots in hacker culture and hacker ethics , its ends are often related to free speech , human rights , or freedom of information movements . hacktivist activities span many political ideals and issues . freenet , a peer-to-peer platform for censorship-resistant communication , is a prime example of translating political thought ( freedom of speech ) into code . hacking as a form of activism can be carried out through a network of activists , such as anonymous and wikileaks , or through a singular activist , working in collaboration toward a common goals without an overarching authority figure . '' hacktivism '' is a controversial term with several meanings . the word was coined to characterize electronic direct action as working toward social change by combining programming skills with critical thinking . but just as hack can sometimes mean cyber crime , hacktivism can be used to mean activism that is malicious , destructive , and undermining the security of the internet as a technical , economic , and political platform . peter krapp , '' noise channels : glitch and error in digital culture '' . university of minnesota press 2011 .
