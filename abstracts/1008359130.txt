debt is an obligation that requires one party , the debtor , to pay money or other agreed-upon value to another party , the creditor . debt is a deferred payment , or series of payments , which differentiates it from an immediate purchase . the debt may be owed by sovereign state or country , local government , company , or an individual . commercial debt is generally subject to contractual terms regarding the amount and timing of repayments of principal and interest . loans , bonds , notes , and mortgages are all types of debt . in finance , debt is one of the primary financial instruments , especially as distinct from equity . the term can also be used metaphorically to cover moral obligations and other interactions not based on economic value . for example , in western cultures , a person who has been helped by a second person is sometimes said to owe a '' debt of gratitude '' to the second person .
