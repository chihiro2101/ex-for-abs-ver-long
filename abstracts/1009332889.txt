an amphibious vehicle ( or simply amphibian ) , is a vehicle that is a means of transport , viable on land as well as on ( or under ) water . amphibious vehicles include amphibious bicycles , atvs , cars , buses , trucks , combat vehicles , boats and hovercraft . classic landing craft are not amphibious vehicles as they do not offer any real land transportation at all , although they are part of amphibious warfare . ground effect vehicles , such as ekranoplans , will likely crash on any but the flattest of landmasses so are also not considered to be amphibious vehicles .
