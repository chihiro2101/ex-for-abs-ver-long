the british agricultural revolution , or second agricultural revolution , was the unprecedented increase in agricultural production in britain due to increases in labour and land productivity between the mid-17th and late 19th centuries . agricultural output grew faster than the population over the century to 1770 , and thereafter productivity remained among the highest in the world . this increase in the food supply contributed to the rapid growth of population in england and wales , from 5.5 & nbsp ; million in 1700 to over 9 & nbsp ; million by 1801 , though domestic production gave way increasingly to food imports in the nineteenth century as the population more than tripled to over 35 & nbsp ; million . the rise in productivity accelerated the decline of the agricultural share of the labour force , adding to the urban workforce on which industrialization depended : the agricultural revolution has therefore been cited as a cause of the industrial revolution . however , historians continue to dispute when exactly such a '' revolution '' took place and of what it consisted . rather than a single event , g . e . mingay states that there were a '' profusion of agricultural revolutions , one for two centuries before 1650 , another emphasising the century after 1650 , a third for the period 1750–1780 , and a fourth for the middle decades of the nineteenth century '' . g . e . mingay ( ed . ) ( 1977 ) , the agricultural revolution : changes in agriculture 1650–1880 , p . 3 this has led more recent historians to argue that any general statements about '' the agricultural revolution '' are difficult to sustain . peter jones ( 2016 ) , agricultural enlightenment : knowledge , technology , and nature , 1750–1840 , p . 7 see also joel mokry ( 2009 ) , the enlightened economy : britain and the industrial revolution 1700–1850 , p . 173 one important change in farming methods was the move in crop rotation to turnips and clover in place of fallow . turnips can be grown in winter and are deep-rooted , allowing them to gather minerals unavailable to shallow-rooted crops . clover fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere into a form of fertiliser . this permitted the intensive arable cultivation of light soils on enclosed farms and provided fodder to support increased livestock numbers whose manure added further to soil fertility .
