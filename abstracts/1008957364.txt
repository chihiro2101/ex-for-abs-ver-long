the africanized bee , also known as the africanized honey bee and known colloquially as the '' killer bee '' , is a hybrid of the western honey bee ( apis mellifera ) , produced originally by crossbreeding of the african bee ( a . & nbsp ; m . & nbsp ; scutellata ) with various european honey bee subspecies such as the italian honey bee ( italian bee ) and the iberian honey bee ( apis mellifera iberiensis ) . the east african lowland honey bee was first introduced to brazil in 1956 in an effort to increase honey production , but 26 & nbsp ; swarms escaped quarantine in 1957 . since then , the hybrid has spread throughout south america and arrived in north america in 1985 . hives were found in south texas in the united states in 1990 . africanized honey bees are typically much more defensive than other varieties of honey bees , and react to disturbances faster than european honey bees . they can chase a person a quarter of a mile ( 400 & nbsp ; m ) ; they have killed some 1,000 & nbsp ; humans , with victims receiving 10 times more stings than from european honey bees . they have also killed horses and other animals .
