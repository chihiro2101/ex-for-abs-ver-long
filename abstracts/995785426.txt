escheat is a common law doctrine that transfers the real property of a person who has died without heirs to the crown or state . it serves to ensure that property is not left in '' limbo '' without recognized ownership . it originally applied to a number of situations where a legal interest in land was destroyed by operation of law , so that the ownership of the land reverted to the immediately superior feudal lord .
