lamarckism , also known as lamarckian inheritance or neo-lamarckism , is the notion that an organism can pass on to its offspring physical characteristics that the parent organism acquired through use or disuse during its lifetime . it is also called the inheritance of acquired characteristics or more recently soft inheritance . the idea is named after the french zoologist jean-baptiste lamarck ( 1744â€“1829 ) , who incorporated the classical era theory of soft inheritance into his theory of evolution as a supplement to his concept of orthogenesis , a drive towards complexity . introductory textbooks contrast lamarckism with charles darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection . darwin 's book on the origin of species however supported the lamarckian idea of use and disuse inheritance , and his own concept of pangenesis implied a lamarckian soft inheritance . many researchers from the 1860s onwards attempted to find evidence for lamarckian inheritance , but these have all been explained away , either by other mechanisms such as genetic contamination or as fraud . august weismann 's experiment , considered definitive in its time , is now considered to have failed to disprove lamarckism , as it did not address use and disuse . later , mendelian genetics supplanted the notion of inheritance of acquired traits , eventually leading to the development of the modern synthesis , and the general abandonment of lamarckism in biology . despite this , interest in lamarckism has continued . studies in the fields of epigenetics , genetics , and somatic hypermutation have highlighted the possible inheritance of traits acquired by the previous generation . the characterization of these findings as lamarckism has been disputed . the inheritance of the hologenome , consisting of the genomes of all an organism 's symbiotic microbes as well as its own genome , is also somewhat lamarckian in effect , though entirely darwinian in its mechanisms .
