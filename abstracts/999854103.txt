a shock absorber or damper is a mechanical or hydraulic device designed to absorb and damp shock impulses . it does this by converting the kinetic energy of the shock into another form of energy ( typically heat ) which is then dissipated . most shock absorbers are a form of dashpot ( a damper which resists motion via viscous friction ) .
