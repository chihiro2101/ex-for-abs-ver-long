non-volatile random-access memory ( nvram ) is random-access memory that retains data without applied power . this is in contrast to dynamic random-access memory ( dram ) and static random-access memory ( sram ) , which both maintain data only for as long as power is applied , or such forms of memory as magnetic tape , which can not be randomly accessed but which retains data indefinitely without electric power . read-only memory devices can be used to store system firmware in embedded systems such as an automotive ignition system control or home appliance . they are also used to hold the initial processor instructions required to bootstrap a computer system . read-write memory can be used to store calibration constants , passwords , or setup information , and may be integrated into a microcontroller . if the main memory of a computer system were non-volatile , it would greatly reduce the time required to start a system after a power interruption . current existing types of semiconductor non-volatile memory have limitations in memory size , power consumption , or operating life that make them impractical for main memory . development is going on for the use of non-volatile memory chips as a system 's main memory , as persistent memory . known as nvdimm-p , it is expected to be released in 2020 .
