pmma transmits up to 92 % of visible light ( 3 & nbsp ; mm thickness ) , and gives a reflection of about 4 % from each of its surfaces due to its refractive index ( 1.4905 at 589.3 & nbsp ; nm ) . refractive index and related constants – poly ( methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma , acrylic glass ) . refractiveindex.info . retrieved 2014-10-27 . it filters ultraviolet ( uv ) light at wavelengths below about 300 nm ( similar to ordinary window glass ) . some manufacturers altuglas international plexiglas uf-3 uf-4 and uf-5 sheets . plexiglas.com . retrieved 2012-05-09 . add coatings or additives to pmma to improve absorption in the 300–400 & nbsp ; nm range . pmma passes infrared light of up to 2,800 & nbsp ; nm and blocks ir of longer wavelengths up to 25,000 & nbsp ; nm . colored pmma varieties allow specific ir wavelengths to pass while blocking visible light ( for remote control or heat sensor applications , for example ) . pmma swells and dissolves in many organic solvents ; it also has poor resistance to many other chemicals due to its easily hydrolysis ester groups . nevertheless , its environmental stability is superior to most other plastics such as polystyrene and polyethylene , and pmma is therefore often the material of choice for outdoor applications . myer ezrin plastics failure guide : cause and prevention , hanser verlag , 1996 , p . 168 pmma has a maximum water absorption ratio of 0.3–0.4 % by weight . data table for : polymers : commodity polymers : pmma . matbase.com . retrieved 2012-05-09 . tensile strength decreases with increased water absorption . its coefficient of thermal expansion is relatively high at ( 5–10 ) ×10 −5 °c −1 .
