a sprachbund , lit . '' language federation '' ) , also known as a linguistic area , area of linguistic convergence , diffusion area or language crossroads , is a group of languages that share areal features resulting from geographical proximity and language contact . the languages may be genetically unrelated , or only distantly related , but the sprachbund characteristics might give a false appearance of relatedness . a grouping of languages that share features can only be defined as a sprachbund if the features are shared for some reason other than the genetic history of the languages . because of this , attempts to classify some language families without knowledge about the history of the languages can lead to misclassification as sprachbunds and similarly some sprachbunds are incorrectly classified as language families .
