the mistle thrush ( turdus viscivorus ) is a bird common to much of europe , palearctic and north africa . it is a year-round resident in a large part of its range , but northern and eastern populations migrate south for the winter , often in small flocks . it is a large thrush with pale grey-brown upper parts , a greyish-white chin and throat , and black spots on its pale yellow and off-white under parts . the sexes are similar in plumage , and its three subspecies show only minimal differences . the male has a loud , far-carrying song which is delivered even in wet and windy weather , earning the bird the old name of stormcock . found in open woods , parks , hedges and cultivated land , the mistle thrush feeds on a wide variety of invertebrates , seeds and berries . its preferred fruits include those of the mistletoe , holly and yew . mistletoe is favoured where it is available , and this is reflected in the thrush 's english and scientific names ; the plant , a parasitic species , benefits from its seeds being excreted by the thrush onto branches where they can germinate . in winter , a mistle thrush will vigorously defend mistletoe clumps or a holly tree as a food reserve for when times are hard . the open cup nest is built against a trunk or in a forked branch , and is fearlessly defended against potential predators , sometimes including humans or cats . the clutch , typically of three to five eggs , is incubated for 12–15 & nbsp ; days , mainly by the female . the chicks fledge about 14–16 & nbsp ; days after hatching . there are normally two broods . there was a range expansion in the 18th and early 19th centuries , and a small decline in recent decades , perhaps due to changes in agricultural practices . given its high numbers and very large range , this thrush is classified by the international union for conservation of nature as being of least concern .
