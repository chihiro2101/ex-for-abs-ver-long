the canal network of the united kingdom played a vital role in the industrial revolution . the canals permitted the creation of wealth , by industry , that led to the british empire in the victorian era . the uk was the first country to develop a nationwide canal network , which expanded to nearly 4,000 miles ( 6,400 kilometres ) in length . the canals allowed raw materials to be transported to a place of manufacture , and finished goods to be transported to consumers , more quickly and cheaply than via a land based route . in the post-medieval period , some rivers were canalised for boat traffic . the exeter ship canal was completed in 1567 . the sankey canal was the first british canal of the industrial revolution , opening in 1757 . the bridgewater canal followed in 1761 and proved to be highly profitable . a '' golden age '' of canals occurred between the 1770s and 1830s , during which the majority of the network was built . from 1840 the canals began to decline , because the growing railway network was a more efficient means of transporting goods . from the beginning of the 20th century the road network became progressively more important , canals became uneconomic and were abandoned . consequently , in 1948 , much of the network was nationalised . since the second half of the 20th century there has been a growing use of the canals for recreation and tourism . different types of boat used the canals , the most common being the traditional narrowboat , that were painted in the roses and castles design . at the outset the boats were towed by horses and later they were driven by diesel engines . restoration projects take place to restore closed canals and canal museums have opened . the network built was extensive and included feats of civil engineering such as the anderton boat lift , the manchester ship canal , the worsley navigable levels and the pontcysyllte aqueduct .
