schwann cells or neurolemmocytes ( named after german physiologist theodor schwann ) are the principal glia of the peripheral nervous system ( pns ) . glial cells function to support neurons and in the pns , also include satellite cells , olfactory ensheathing cells , enteric glia and glia that reside at sensory nerve endings , such as the pacinian corpuscle . the two types of schwann cells are myelinating and nonmyelinating . myelinating schwann cells wrap around axons of motor and sensory neurons to form the myelin sheath . the schwann cell promoter is present in the downstream region of the human dystrophin gene that gives shortened transcript that are again synthesized in a tissue-specific manner . during the development of the pns , the regulatory mechanisms of myelination are controlled by feedforward interaction of specific genes , influencing transcriptional cascades and shaping the morphology of the myelinated nerve fibers . schwann cells are involved in many important aspects of peripheral nerve biology—the conduction of action potential along axons , nerve development and regeneration , trophic support for neurons , production of the nerve extracellular matrix , modulation of neuromuscular synaptic activity , and presentation of antigens to t-lymphocytes . charcot–marie–tooth disease , guillain–barré syndrome ( acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy type ) , schwannomatosis , chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy , and leprosy are all neuropathies involving schwann cells .
