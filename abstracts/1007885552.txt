persecution is the systematic mistreatment of an individual or group by another individual or group . the most common forms are religious persecution , racism and political persecution , though there is naturally some overlap between these terms . the inflicting of suffering , harassment , imprisonment , internment , fear , or pain are all factors that may establish persecution , but not all suffering will necessarily establish persecution . the suffering experienced by the victim must be sufficiently severe . the threshold level of severity has been a source of much debate .
