dorestad ( dorestat , duristat ) was an early medieval emporium , located in the southeast of the province of utrecht in the netherlands , close to the modern-day town of wijk bij duurstede . it flourished during the 8th to early 9th centuries , as an important port on the northeastern shipping routes due to its proximity to the fork in the rhine , with access to germany via the nederrijn ( the northernmost branch of the rhine ) , to the belgium , northern france , and england ( via the lek ) , and to the netherlands , northern germany , and scandinavia ( via the kromme rijn ) .
