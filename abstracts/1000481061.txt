the swim bladder , gas bladder , fish maw , or air bladder is an internal gas-filled organ that contributes to the ability of many bony fish ( but not cartilaginous fish ) to control their buoyancy , and thus to stay at their current water depth without having to waste energy in swimming . also , the dorsal position of the swim bladder means the center of mass is below the centroid , allowing it to act as a stabilizing agent . additionally , the swim bladder functions as a resonator , to produce or receive sound . the swim bladder is evolutionarily homologous to the lungs . charles darwin remarked upon this in on the origin of species . darwin , charles ( 1859 ) origin of species page 190 , reprinted 1872 by d . appleton . darwin reasoned that the lung in air-breathing vertebrates had derived from a more primitive swim bladder . in the embryonic stages , some species , such as redlip blenny , have lost the swim bladder again , mostly bottom dwellers like the weather fish . other fish—like the opah and the pomfret—use their pectoral fins to swim and balance the weight of the head to keep a horizontal position . the normally bottom dwelling sea robin can use their pectoral fins to produce lift while swimming . the gas/tissue interface at the swim bladder produces a strong reflection of sound , which is used in sonar equipment to find fish . chondrichthyes , such as sharks and rays , do not have swim bladders . some of them can control their depth only by swimming ( using dynamic lift ) ; others store fats or oils with density less than that of seawater to produce a neutral or near neutral buoyancy , which does not change with depth .
