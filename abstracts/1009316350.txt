several of granada 's programmes administered their websites using g-wizz , including this morning , coronation street and emmerdale . its flash-heavy pages were mostly unusable by subscribers , who were then still largely modem-based , and take-up was low . less than a year after it opened , granada closed g-wizz in march 2001 , after it had cost the company Â£9 & nbsp ; million . it combined the remainder of its online presence with fellow itv company carlton to launch itv.com .
