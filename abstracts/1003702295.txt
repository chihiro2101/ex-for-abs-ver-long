a hexokinase is an enzyme that phosphorylates hexoses ( six-carbon sugars ) , forming hexose phosphate . in most organisms , glucose is the most important substrate for hexokinases , and glucose-6-phosphate is the most important product . hexokinase possesses the ability to transfer an inorganic phosphate group from atp to a substrate . hexokinases should not be confused with glucokinase , which is a specific isoform of hexokinase . all hexokinases are capable of phosphorylating several hexoses but glucokinase acts with a 50-fold lower substrate affinity and its main hexose substrate is glucose .
