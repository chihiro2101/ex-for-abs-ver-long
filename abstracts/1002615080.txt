thumb five-pin bowling is a bowling variant which is played in canada , where many bowling alleys offer it , either alone or in combination with ten-pin bowling . it was devised around 1909 by thomas f . ryan in toronto , at his toronto bowling club , in response to customers who complained that the ten-pin game was too strenuous . he cut five tenpins down to about 75 % of their size , and used hand-sized hard rubber balls , thus inventing the original version of five-pin bowling .
