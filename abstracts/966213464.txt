futurebus , or ieee 896 , is a computer bus standard , intended to replace all local bus connections in a computer , including the cpu , memory , plug-in cards and even , to some extent , lan links between machines . the effort started in 1979 and did n't complete until 1987 , and then immediately went into a redesign that lasted until 1994 . by this point , implementation of a chip-set based on the standard lacked industry leadership . it has seen little real-world use , although custom implementations continue to be designed and used throughout industry .
