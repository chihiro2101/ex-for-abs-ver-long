film speed is the measure of a photographic film 's photosensitivity , determined by sensitometry and measured on film , the most recent being the iso system . a closely related iso system is used to describe the relationship between exposure and output image lightness in digital cameras . relatively insensitive film , with a correspondingly lower speed index , requires more exposure to light to produce the same image density as a more sensitive film , and is thus commonly termed a slow film . highly sensitive films are correspondingly termed fast films . in both digital and film photography , the reduction of exposure corresponding to use of higher sensitivities generally leads to reduced image quality ( via coarser film grain or higher image noise of other types ) . in short , the higher the sensitivity , the grainier the image will be . ultimately sensitivity is limited by the quantum efficiency of the film or sensor .
