guinn v . united states , 238 u.s . 347 ( 1915 ) , was a united states supreme court decision that found certain grandfather clause exemptions to literacy tests for voting rights to be unconstitutional . though these grandfather clauses were superficially race neutral , they were designed to protect the voting rights of illiterate white voters while disenfranchising black voters . the 1870 ratification of the fifteenth amendment to the united states constitution barred each state from denying the right to vote on the basis of '' race , color , or previous condition of servitude . '' in response , several southern states , including oklahoma , established constitutional provisions designed to effectively disenfranchise african-american voters without explicitly violating the fifteenth amendment . in his majority opinion , chief justice edward douglass white held that oklahoma 's grandfather clause was '' repugnant to the fifteenth amendment and therefore null and void . '' the decision had little immediate impact , as southern legislatures found other methods to disenfranchise blacks .
