walther rathenau ( 29 september 1867 – 24 june 1922 ) was a german industrialist , writer and liberal politician . during the first world war of 1914–1918 he was involved in the organization of the german war economy . after the war , rathenau served as german foreign minister ( february to june 1922 ) of the weimar republic . rathenau initiated the 1922 treaty of rapallo , which removed major obstacles to trading with soviet russia . although russia was already aiding german rearmament programme , right-wing nationalist groups branded rathenau a revolutionary ( he was in fact a moderate liberal who openly condemned soviet methods ) . they also resented his background as a successful jewish businessman . two months after the signing of the treaty , the right-wing militant group organisation consul assassinated rathenau in berlin . some members of the public viewed rathenau as a democratic martyr ; after the nsdap came to power in 1933 they banned all commemoration of him .
