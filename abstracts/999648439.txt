life extension is the concept of extending the human lifespan , either modestly through improvements in medicine or dramatically by increasing the maximum lifespan beyond its generally-settled oldest people . the technology to achieve such dramatic changes , however , does not currently exist . several researchers in the area , along with '' life extensionists '' , '' immortalists '' or '' longevists '' ( those who wish to achieve longer lives themselves ) , postulate that future breakthroughs in tissue rejuvenation , stem cells , regenerative medicine , molecular repair , gene therapy , pharmaceuticals and organ replacement ( such as with artificial organs or xenotransplantations ) will eventually enable humans to have indefinite lifespans ( agerasia ) through complete rejuvenation to a healthy youthful condition . the ethical ramifications , if life extension becomes a possibility , are debated by bioethicists . the sale of purported anti-aging products such as supplements and hormone replacement is a lucrative global industry . for example , the industry that promotes the use of hormones as a treatment for consumers to slow or reverse the aging process in the us market generated about 50 & nbsp ; billion of revenue a year in 2009 . the use of such products , however , has not been proven to be effective or safe .
