skiing , or traveling over snow on skis , has a history of at least eight millennia . the earliest archaeological examples of skis were found in russia and date to 6000 bce . although modern skiing has evolved from beginnings in scandinavia , 5000-year-old wall paintings suggest use of skis in the xinjiang region of what is now china ; however , this continues to be debated . originally purely utilitarian , starting in the mid-1800s skiing became a popular recreational activity and sport , becoming practiced in snow-covered regions worldwide , and providing a market for the development of ski resorts and their related communities .
