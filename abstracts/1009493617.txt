jean-philippe rameau ; – was one of the most important french composers and music theory of the 18th century . new grove p . 243 : '' a theorist of european stature , he was also france 's leading 18th-century composer . '' he replaced jean-baptiste lully as the dominant composer of french opera and is also considered the leading french composer of his time for the harpsichord , alongside françois couperin . girdlestone p . 14 : '' it is customary to couple him with couperin as one couples haydn with mozart or ravel with debussy . '' little is known about rameau 's early years . it was not until the 1720s that he won fame as a major theorist of music with his treatise on harmony ( 1722 ) and also in the following years as a composer of masterpieces for the harpsichord , which circulated throughout europe . he was almost 50 before he embarked on the operatic career on which his reputation chiefly rests today . his debut , hippolyte et aricie ( 1733 ) , caused a great stir and was fiercely attacked by the supporters of lully 's style of music for its revolutionary use of harmony . nevertheless , rameau 's pre-eminence in the field of french opera was soon acknowledged , and he was later attacked as an '' establishment '' composer by those who favoured italian opera during the controversy known as the querelle des bouffons in the 1750s . rameau 's music had gone out of fashion by the end of the 18th century , and it was not until the 20th that serious efforts were made to revive it . today , he enjoys renewed appreciation with performances and recordings of his music ever more frequent .
