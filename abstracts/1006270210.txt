a lifting body is a fixed-wing aircraft or spacecraft configuration in which the body itself produces lift . in contrast to a flying wing , which is a wing with minimal or no conventional fuselage , a lifting body can be thought of as a fuselage with little or no conventional wing . whereas a flying wing seeks to maximize cruise efficiency at subsonic speeds by eliminating non-lifting surfaces , lifting bodies generally minimize the drag and structure of a wing for subsonic , supersonic and hypersonic flight , or spacecraft re-entry . all of these flight regimes pose challenges for proper flight safety . lifting bodies were a major area of research in the 1960s and 70s as a means to build a small and lightweight manned spacecraft . the us built a number of lifting body rocket planes to test the concept , as well as several rocket-launched re-entry vehicles that were tested over the pacific . interest waned as the us air force lost interest in the manned mission , and major development ended during the space shuttle design process when it became clear that the highly shaped fuselages made it difficult to fit fuel tankage . advanced spaceplane concepts in the 1990s and 2000s did use lifting-body designs . examples include the hl-20 personnel launch system ( 1990 ) and the prometheus spaceplane ( 2010 ) . the dream chaser lifting-body spaceplane , an extension of hl-20 technology , was under development as one of three vehicles to potentially carry us crew to and from the international space station . in 2015 the esa intermediate experimental vehicle performed the first ever successful reentry of a lifting body spacecraft .
