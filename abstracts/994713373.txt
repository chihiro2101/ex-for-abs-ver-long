lipid-anchored proteins ( also known as lipid-linked proteins ) are proteins located on the surface of the cell membrane that are covalently attached to lipids embedded within the cell membrane . these proteins insert and assume a place in the bilayer structure of the membrane alongside the similar fatty acid tails . the lipid-anchored protein can be located on either side of the cell membrane . thus , the lipid serves to anchor the protein to the cell membrane . they are a type of proteolipids . the lipid groups play a role in protein interaction and can contribute to the function of the protein to which it is attached . furthermore , the lipid serves as a mediator of membrane associations or as a determinant for specific protein-protein interactions . for example , lipid groups can play an important role in increasing molecular hydrophobe . this allows for the interaction of proteins with cellular membranes and protein domains . in a dynamic role , lipidation can sequester a protein away from its substrate to inactivate the protein and then activate it by substrate presentation . overall , there are three main types of lipid-anchored proteins which include prenylated proteins , fatty acylated proteins and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins ( gpi ) . a protein can have multiple lipid groups covalently attached to it , but the site where the lipid binds to the protein depends both on the lipid group and protein .
