the german aircraft carrier graf zeppelin was the lead ship in a class of two carriers of the same name ordered by the kriegsmarine of nazi germany . she was the only aircraft carrier launched by germany and represented part of the kriegsmarines attempt to create a well-balanced oceangoing fleet , capable of projecting german naval power far beyond the narrow confines of the baltic and north seas . the carrier would have had a complement of 42 fighters and dive bombers . construction on graf zeppelin began on 28 december 1936 , when her keel was laid down at the deutsche werke shipyard in kiel . named in honor of graf ( count ) ferdinand von zeppelin , the ship was launched on 8 december 1938 , and was 85 % complete by the outbreak of world war ii in september 1939 . graf zeppelin was not completed and was never operational due to shifting construction priorities necessitated by the war . she remained in the baltic for the duration of the war ; with germany 's defeat imminent , the ship 's custodian crew scuttled her just outside stettin in march 1945 . the soviet union raised the ship in march 1946 , and she was ultimately sunk in weapons tests north of poland 17 months later . the wreck was discovered by a polish survey ship in july 2006 .
