karyotyping is the process by which photographs of chromosomes are taken in order to determine the chromosome complement of an individual , including the number of chromosomes and any abnormalities . the term is also used for the complete set of chromosomes in a species or in an individual organism concise oxford dictionary and for a test that detects this complement or measures the number . karyotypes describe the chromosome count of an organism and what these chromosomes look like under a light microscope . attention is paid to their length , the position of the centromeres , banding pattern , any differences between the sex chromosomes , and any other physical characteristics . the preparation and study of karyotypes is part of cytogenetics . the study of whole sets of chromosomes is sometimes known as karyology . the chromosomes are depicted ( by rearranging a photomicrograph ) in a standard format known as a karyogram or idiogram : in pairs , ordered by size and position of centromere for chromosomes of the same size . the basic number of chromosomes in the somatic cells of an individual or a species is called the somatic number and is designated 2n . in the germ-line ( the sex cells ) the chromosome number is n ( humans : n 23 ) . p28 thus , in humans 2n 46 . so , in normal diploid organisms , autosomal chromosomes are present in two copies . there may , or may not , be sex chromosomes . polyploid cells have multiple copies of chromosomes and ploidy cells have single copies . karyotypes can be used for many purposes ; such as to study chromosomal aberrations , cellular function , taxonomic relationships , medicine and to gather information about past evolutionary events ( systematics ) .
