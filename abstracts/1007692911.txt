sir galahad ; sometimes referred to as galeas or galath among other versions of his name , is a knight of king arthur 's round table and one of the three achievers of the holy grail in arthurian legend . he is the illegitimate son of sir lancelot and elaine of corbenic , and is renowned for his gallantry and purity as the most perfect of all knights . emerging quite late in the medieval arthurian tradition , sir galahad first appears in the lancelotâ€“grail cycle , and his story is taken up in later works such as the post-vulgate cycle and sir thomas malory 's le morte d'arthur . his name should not be mistaken with galehaut , a different knight from arthurian legend .
