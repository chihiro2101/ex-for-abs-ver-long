richard iii is a play by william shakespeare . it was probably written around 1593 . it is labelled a history in the first folio , and is usually considered one , but it is sometimes called a tragedy , as in the quarto edition . richard iii concludes shakespeare 's first tetralogy ( also containing henry vi , part 1 , and henry vi , part 2 , and henry vi , part 3 ) and depicts the machiavellian rise to power and subsequent short reign of richard iii of england . it is the second longest play in the shakespeare 's plays , and is the longest of the first folio , whose version of hamlet , otherwise the longest , is shorter than its quarto counterpart . the play is often abridged for brevity , and peripheral characters removed . in such cases , extra lines are often invented or added from elsewhere to establish the nature of the characters ' relationships . a further reason for abridgment is that shakespeare assumed his audiences ' familiarity with his henry vi plays , frequently referring to these plays .
