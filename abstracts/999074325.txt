women 's gridiron football , more commonly known as women 's american football , women 's canadian football , or simply women 's football , is a form of gridiron football ( american or canadian ) played by women . most leagues play by the same rules as their male counterparts , with one exception : women 's leagues use a slightly smaller football . women primarily play on a semi-professional or amateur level in the united states . very few high schools or colleges offer the sport solely for women and girls . however , on occasion , it is permissible for a female player to join the otherwise male team . the first evidence of women playing organized football was in 1926 . it was then that an nfl team called the frankford yellow jackets ( the predecessors to the modern philadelphia eagles ) employed a women 's team for halftime entertainment .
