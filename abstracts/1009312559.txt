artie shaw ( born arthur jacob arshawsky ; may 23 , 1910 â€“ december 30 , 2004 ) was an american clarinetist , composer , bandleader , actor and author of both fiction and non-fiction . widely regarded as '' one of jazz 's finest clarinetists '' , shaw led one of the united states ' most popular big bands in the late 1930s through the early 1940s . though he had numerous hit records , he was perhaps best known for his 1938 recording of cole porter 's '' begin the beguine . '' before the release of '' beguine , '' shaw and his fledgling band had languished in relative obscurity for over two years and , after its release , he became a major pop artist within short order . the record eventually became one of the era 's defining recordings . musically restless , shaw was also an early proponent of what became known much later as third stream music , which blended elements of classical and jazz forms and traditions . his music influenced other musicians , such as monty norman in england , with the vamp of the james bond theme , possibly influenced by 1938 's '' nightmare '' . shaw also recorded with small jazz groups drawn from within the ranks of the various big bands he led . he served in the us navy from 1942 to 1944 , ( during which time he led a morale-building band that toured the south pacific amidst the chaos of world war ii ) and , following his discharge in 1944 , he returned to lead a band through 1945 . following the breakup of that band , he began to focus on other interests and gradually withdrew from the world of being a professional musician and major celebrity , although he remained a force in popular music and jazz before retiring from music completely in 1954 .
