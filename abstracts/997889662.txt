thumb the müller-lyer illusion is an optical illusion consisting of three stylized arrows . when viewers are asked to place a mark on the figure at the midpoint , they invariably place it more towards the '' tail '' end . the illusion was devised by franz carl müller-lyer ( 1857–1916 ) , a german sociologist , in 1889 . a variation of the same effect ( and the most common form in which it is seen today ) consists of a set of arrow-like figures . straight line segments of equal length comprise the '' shafts '' of the arrows , while shorter line segments ( called the fins ) protrude from the ends of the shaft . the fins can point inwards to form an arrow '' head '' or outwards to form an arrow '' tail '' . the line segment forming the shaft of the arrow with two tails is perceived to be longer than that forming the shaft of the arrow with two heads .
