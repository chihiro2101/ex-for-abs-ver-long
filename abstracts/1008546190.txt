john zachary delorean ( january 6 , 1925 â€“ march 19 , 2005 ) was an american engineer , inventor , and executive in the u.s . automobile industry , most widely known for his work at general motors and as founder of the delorean motor company . delorean managed the development of a number of vehicles throughout his career , including the pontiac gto muscle car , the pontiac firebird , pontiac grand prix , chevrolet cosworth vega , and the dmc delorean sports car , which was featured in the 1985 film back to the future . he was the youngest division head in general motors history , then broke away to start the delorean motor company ( dmc ) in 1973 . however , production delays meant that dmc 's first car did not reach the consumer market until 1981 , where a depressed buying market was compounded by lukewarm reviews from critics and the public . after a year , the delorean had failed to recoup its 175 million in investment costs , unsold cars were accumulating , and the company was in dire financial straits . in october 1982 , delorean was charged with cocaine trafficking after fbi informant james hoffman solicited him as financier in a scheme to sell of cocaine worth approximately 24 million . dmc was insolvent at the time and in debt for 17 million . hoffman had approached delorean , a man whom he barely knew with no prior criminal record , and delorean was able to successfully defend himself at trial under the procedural defense of police entrapment . the trial ended in a not guilty verdict in august 1984 , by which time dmc had declared bankruptcy and shut down .
