three major genes are involved in determination of drosophila sex . these are sex-lethal , sisterless , and deadpan . deadpan is an autosomal gene which inhibits sex-lethal , while sisterless is carried on the x chromosome and inhibits the action of deadpan . an aax cell has twice as much deadpan as sisterless , so sex-lethal will be inhibited , creating a male . however , an aaxx cell will produce enough sisterless to inhibit the action of deadpan , allowing the sex-lethal gene to be transcribed to create a female . later , control by deadpan and sisterless disappears and what becomes important is the form of the sex-lethal gene . a secondary promoter causes transcription in both males and females . analysis of the cdna has shown that different forms are expressed in males and females . sex-lethal has been shown to affect the splicing of its own mrna . in males , the third exon is included which encodes a stop codon , causing a truncated form to be produced . in the female version , the presence of sex-lethal causes this exon to be missed out ; the other seven amino acids are produced as a full peptide chain , again giving a difference between males and females . presence or absence of functional sex-lethal proteins now go on to affect the transcription of another protein known as doublesex . in the absence of sex-lethal , doublesex will have the fourth exon removed and be translated up to and including exon 6 ( dsx-male ) , while in its presence the fourth exon which encodes a stop codon will produce a truncated version of the protein ( dsx-female ) . dsx-f causes transcription of yolk proteins 1 and 2 in somatic cells , which will be pumped into the oocyte on its production .
