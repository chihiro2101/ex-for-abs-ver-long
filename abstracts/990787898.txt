thumb ieee & nbsp ; 488 is a short-range digital communications 8-bit parallel multi-master interface bus specification developed by hewlett-packard as hp-ib ( hewlett-packard interface bus ) . it subsequently became the subject of several standards , and is generically known as gpib ( general purpose interface bus ) . although the bus was created in the late 1960s to connect together automated test equipment , it also had some success during the 1970s and 1980s as a peripheral bus for early microcomputers , notably the commodore pet . newer standards have largely replaced ieee & nbsp ; 488 for computer use , but it is still used by some test equipment .
