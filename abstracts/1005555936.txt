methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) refers to a group of gram-positive bacteria that are genetically distinct from other strains of staphylococcus aureus . mrsa is responsible for several difficult-to-treat infections in humans . mrsa is any strain of s . aureus that has developed ( through natural selection ) or acquired ( through horizontal gene transfer ) a multiple drug resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics . beta-lactam ( Î²-lactam ) antibiotics are a broad-spectrum group that include some penams ( penicillin derivatives such as methicillin and oxacillin ) and cephems such as the cephalosporins . strains unable to resist these antibiotics are classified as methicillin-susceptible s . aureus , or mssa . mrsa is common in hospitals , prisons , and nursing homes , where people with open wounds , invasive devices such as catheters , and weakened immune systems are at greater risk of hospital-acquired infection . mrsa began as a hospital-acquired infection but has become community-acquired , as well as livestock-acquired . the terms ha-mrsa ( healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired mrsa ) , ca-mrsa ( community-associated mrsa ) , and la-mrsa ( livestock-associated mrsa ) reflect this .
