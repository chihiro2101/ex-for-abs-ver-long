the development of the nervous system , or neural development , or neurodevelopment , refers to the processes that generate , shape , and reshape the nervous system of animals , from the earliest stages of embryonic development to adulthood . the field of neural development draws on both neuroscience and developmental biology to describe and provide insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which complex nervous systems develop , from nematodes and fruit flies to mammals . defects in neural development can lead to malformations such as holoprosencephaly , and a wide variety of neurological disorders including paresis and paralysis , balance and vision disorders , and seizures , and in humans other disorders such as rett syndrome , down syndrome and intellectual disability .
