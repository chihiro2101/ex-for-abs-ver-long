reconfigurable computing is a computer architecture combining some of the flexibility of software with the high performance of hardware by processing with very flexible high speed computing fabrics like fpgas ( fpgas ) . the principal difference when compared to using ordinary microprocessors is the ability to make substantial changes to the datapath itself in addition to the control flow . on the other hand , the main difference from custom hardware , i.e . application-specific integrated circuits ( asics ) is the possibility to adapt the hardware during runtime by '' loading '' a new circuit on the reconfigurable fabric .
