the toga , , a distinctive garment of ancient rome , was a roughly semicircular cloth , between in length , draped over the shoulders and around the body . it was usually woven from white wool , and was worn over a tunic . in roman historiography , it is said to have been the favored dress of romulus , rome 's founder ; it was also thought to have originally been worn by both sexes , and by the citizen-military . as roman women gradually adopted the stola , the toga was recognized as formal wear for roman citizenship . . women engaged in prostitution might have provided the main exception to this rule . . the type of toga worn reflected a citizen 's rank in the civil hierarchy . various roman law restricted its use to citizens , who were required to wear it for public festivals and civic duties . from its probable beginnings as a simple , practical work-garment , the toga became more voluminous , complex , and costly , increasingly unsuited to anything but formal and ceremonial use . it was and is considered ancient rome 's '' national costume '' ; as such , it had great symbolic value ; however even among romans , it was hard to put on , uncomfortable and challenging to wear correctly , and never truly popular . when circumstances allowed , those otherwise entitled or obliged to wear it opted for more comfortable , casual garments . it gradually fell out of use , firstly among citizens of the lower class , then those of the middle class . eventually , it was worn only by the highest classes for ceremonial occasions .
