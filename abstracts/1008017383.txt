albius tibullus bc19 bc ) was a latin poet and writer of elegy . his first and second books of poetry are extant ; many other texts attributed to him are of questionable origins . little is known about the life of tibullus . there are only a few references to him by later writers and a short life of doubtful authority . neither his praenomen nor his birthplace is known , and his gentile name has been questioned . his status was probably that of a roman eques ( so the life affirms ) , and he had inherited a considerable estate . like virgil , horace and propertius , he seems to have lost most of it in 41 bc in the confiscations of mark antony and octavian .
