tyrtaeus ; tyrtaios ; fl . mid-7th century bce ) was a greek elegy from sparta . he wrote at a time of two crises affecting the city : a civic unrest threatening the authority of kings and elders , later recalled in a poem named eunomia ( 'law and order ' ) where he reminded citizens to respect the divine and constitutional roles of kings , council , and demos ; and the second messenian war , during which he served as a sort of 'state poet ' , exhorting spartans to fight to the death for their city . in the 4th century bce , when tyrtaeus was an established classic , spartan armies on campaign were made to listen to his poetry , and the suda states that he wrote 'martial songs ' , probably referring to the chants escorting armed dances and processions during some spartan festivals .
