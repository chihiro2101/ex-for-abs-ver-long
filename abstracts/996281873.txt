this list compiles many of the common large shrubs and trees found in canada . the canadian flora is depauperate because of the near total glaciation event in the pleistocene . due to the vast area of canada , a tree that is common in one area may be completely absent in another . in particular , many warm-temperate trees can only be grown on the mild pacific coast ( where gardens may contain additional species not listed here ) . see also provincial tree emblems of canada for the official trees of the provinces and territories of canada .
