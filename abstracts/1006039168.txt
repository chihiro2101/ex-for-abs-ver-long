the periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate recurring ( periodic ) trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases : a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat , meaning that elements with similar behaviour fall into the same vertical columns . the fifth period contains 18 elements , beginning with rubidium and ending with xenon . as a rule , period 5 elements fill their 5s shells first , then their 4d , and 5p shells , in that order ; however , there are exceptions , such as rhodium .
