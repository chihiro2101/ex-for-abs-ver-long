frederick reines ; march 16 , 1918 â€“ august 26 , 1998 ) was an american physicist . he was awarded the 1995 nobel prize in physics for his co-detection of the neutrino with clyde cowan in the neutrino experiment . he may be the only scientist in history '' so intimately associated with the discovery of an elementary particle and the subsequent thorough investigation of its fundamental properties . '' a graduate of stevens institute of technology and new york university , reines joined the manhattan project 's los alamos laboratory in 1944 , working in the theoretical division in richard feynman 's group . he became a group leader there in 1946 . he participated in a number of nuclear tests , culminating in his becoming the director of the operation greenhouse test series in the pacific in 1951 . in the early 1950s , working in hanford and savannah river sites , reines and cowan developed the equipment and procedures with which they first detected the supposedly undetectable neutrinos in june 1956 . reines dedicated the major part of his career to the study of the neutrino 's properties and interactions , which work would influence study of the neutrino for many researchers to come . this included the detection of neutrinos created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays , and the 1987 detection of neutrinos emitted from sn 1987a , which inaugurated the field of neutrino astronomy .
