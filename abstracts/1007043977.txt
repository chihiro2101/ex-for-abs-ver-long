in criminology , corporate crime refers to crimes committed either by a corporation ( i.e . , a business entity having a separate legal personality from the natural persons that manage its activities ) , or by individuals acting on behalf of a corporation or other business entity ( see vicarious liability and corporate liability ) . for the worst corporate crimes , corporations may face judicial dissolution , sometimes called the '' corporate death penalty '' , which is a legal procedure in which a corporation is forced to dissolve or cease to exist . some negative behaviours by corporations may not actually be criminal ; laws vary between jurisdictions . for example , some jurisdictions allow insider trading . corporate crime overlaps with : white-collar crime , because the majority of individuals who may act as or represent the interests of the corporation are white-collar professionals ; organized crime , because criminals may set up corporations either for the purposes of crime or as vehicles for laundering the proceeds of crime . the world 's gross criminal product has been estimated at 20 percent of world trade . ( de brie 2000 ) ; and state-corporate crime because , in many contexts , the opportunity to commit crime emerges from the relationship between the corporation and the state .
