to suggestions that delius 's music is an '' acquired taste '' , fenby answers : '' the music of delius is not an acquired taste . one either likes it the moment one first hears it , or the sound of it is once and for ever distasteful to one . it is an art which will never enjoy an appeal to the many , but one which will always be loved , and dearly loved , by the few . '' fenby ( 1981 ) , p . 208 writing in 2004 on the 70th anniversary of delius 's death , the guardian journalist martin kettle recalls cardus arguing in 1934 that delius as a composer was unique , both in his technique and in his emotionalism . although he eschewed classical formalism , it was wrong , cardus believed , to regard delius merely as '' a tone-painter , an impressionist or a maker of programme music '' . his music 's abiding feature is , cardus wrote , that it '' recollects emotion in tranquillity & nbsp ; . delius is always reminding us that beauty is born by contemplation after the event '' .
