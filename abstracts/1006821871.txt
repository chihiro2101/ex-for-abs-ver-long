thumb petals are modified leaf that surround the reproductive parts of flowers . they are often brightly colored or unusually shaped to attract pollinators . together , all of the petals of a flower are called corolla . petals are usually accompanied by another set of modified leaves called sepals , that collectively form the calyx and lie just beneath the corolla . the calyx and the corolla together make up the perianth . when the petals and sepals of a flower are difficult to distinguish , they are collectively called tepals . examples of plants in which the term tepal is appropriate include genus such as aloe and tulipa . conversely , genera such as rose and phaseolus have well-distinguished sepals and petals . when the undifferentiated tepals resemble petals , they are referred to as '' petaloid '' , as in petaloid monocots , orders of monocots with brightly colored tepals . since they include liliales , an alternative name is lilioid monocots . although petals are usually the most conspicuous parts of animal-pollinated flowers , wind-pollinated species , such as the poaceae , either have very small petals or lack them entirely ( apetalous ) .
