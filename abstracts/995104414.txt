pu this proved that the unknown radioactive source originated from the decay of uranium and , coupled with the previous observation that the source was different chemically from all known elements , proved beyond all doubt that a new element had been discovered . mcmillan and abelson published their results in an article entitled radioactive element 93 in the physical review on may 27 , 1940 . they did not propose a name for the element in the article , but they soon decided on '' neptunium '' , since uranium had been named after the planet uranus , and neptune is the next planet beyond in our solar system . mcmillan suddenly departed at this point , leaving glenn seaborg to pursue this line of research , which led to the second transuranium element , plutonium . in 1951 , mcmillan shared the nobel prize in chemistry with seaborg '' for their discoveries in the chemistry of the transuranium elements '' .
