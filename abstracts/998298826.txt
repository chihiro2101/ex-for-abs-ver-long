thumb a biogeographic realm or ecozone is the broadest biogeography division of earth 's land surface , based on distributional patterns of terrestrial organisms . they are subdivided into ecoregions , which are classified based on their biomes or habitat types . the realms delineate the large areas of earth 's surface within which organisms have been evolving in relative isolation over long periods of time , separated from one another by geographic features , such as oceans , broad deserts , or high mountain ranges , that constitute barriers to migration . as such , biogeographic realm designations are used to indicate general groupings of organisms based on their shared biogeography . biogeographic realms correspond to the phytochorion of botany or zoogeography of zoology . biogeographic realms are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain . they are distinct from biomes , also known as major habitat types , which are divisions of the earth 's surface based on life form , or the adaptation of animals , fungi , micro-organisms and plants to climatic , soil , and other conditions . biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation . each realm may include a number of different biomes . a tropical moist broadleaf forest in central america , for example , may be similar to one in new guinea in its vegetation type and structure , climate , soils , etc . , but these forests are inhabited by animals , fungi , micro-organisms and plants with very different evolutionary histories . the patterns of distribution of living organisms in the world 's biogeographic realms were shaped by the process of plate tectonics , which has redistributed the world 's land masses over geological history .
