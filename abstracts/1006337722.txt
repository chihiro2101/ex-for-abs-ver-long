na⁺/k⁺-atpase ( sodium–potassium adenosine triphosphatase , also known as the na⁺/k⁺ pump or sodium–potassium pump ) is an enzyme ( an electrogenic transmembrane atpase ) found in the membrane of all animal cells . it performs several functions in cell physiology . the na⁺/k⁺-atpase enzyme is active ( i.e . it uses energy from atp ) . for every atp molecule that the pump uses , three sodium ions are exported and two potassium ions are imported ; there is hence a net export of a single positive charge per pump cycle . the sodium–potassium pump was discovered in 1957 by the danish scientist jens christian skou , who was awarded a nobel prize for his work in 1997 . its discovery marked an important step forward in the understanding of how ions get into and out of cells , and it has particular significance for excitable cells such as neuron , which depend on this pump to respond to stimuli and transmit impulses . all mammals have four different sodium pump sub-types , or isoforms . each has unique properties and tissue expression patterns . this enzyme belongs to the family of p-type atpase .
