reclaim the streets also known as rts , are a collective with a shared ideal of community ownership of public spaces . participants characterise the collective as a resistance movement opposed to the dominance of corporate forces in globalisation , and to the car as the dominant mode of transport . reclaim the streets often stage non-violent direct action street reclaiming events such as the 'invasion ' of a major road , highway or freeway to stage a party . while this may obstruct the regular users of these spaces such as car drivers and public bus riders , the philosophy of rts is that it is vehicle traffic , not pedestrians , who are causing the obstruction , and that by occupying the road they are in fact opening up public space . the events are usually spectacular and colourful , with sand pits for children to play in , free food and music , however they have been known to degenerate into riots and violence . naomi klein . no logo . toronto : a.a knopf canada . 2000 . a temporary autonomous zone sometimes results . the style of the parties in many places has been influenced by the rave scene in the uk , with sound systems playing dance music .
