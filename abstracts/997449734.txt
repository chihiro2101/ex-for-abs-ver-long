carding is a mechanical process that disentangles , cleans and intermixes fibres to produce a continuous web or sliver suitable for subsequent processing . this is achieved by passing the fibres between differentially moving surfaces covered with card clothing . it breaks up locks and unorganised clumps of fibre and then aligns the individual fibres to be parallel with each other . in preparing wool fibre for spinning , carding is the step that comes after teasing . the word is derived from the latin carduus meaning thistle or teasel , as dried vegetable teasels were first used to comb the raw wool .
