the battle of sainte-foy , sometimes called the battle of quebec , was fought on april 28 , 1760 near the british-held town of quebec in the french province of canada during the seven years ' war ( called the french and indian war in the united states ) . it was a victory for the france under the chevalier de lévis over the british army under general murray . the battle was notably bloodier than the battle of the plains of abraham of the previous september , with 833 french casualties to 1,124 british casualties . at first the british had some success , but the advance masked their artillery , while the infantry became bogged down in the mud and melting snowdrifts of the late spring . the battle turned into a two-hour fight at close range ; eventually , as more french soldiers joined the fray , the french turned the british flanks , forcing murray to realize his mistake and to recall the british back to quebec without their guns , which lévis then turned on the city .
