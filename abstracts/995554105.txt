'' the band enjoyed positive critical appraisal , but met with mixed results commercially . in the united states the band was embraced and promoted by the indie rock community , including public and college radio stations and mtv 's 120 minutes , which the band once guest-hosted , but received little support from commercial rock radio and other music television programs . this limited their mainstream exposure and support in their home country , while internationally they enjoyed high-profile success , especially in belgium , russia , portugal , france and australia .
