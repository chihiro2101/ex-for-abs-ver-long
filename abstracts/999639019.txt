memory stick is a removable flash memory card format , originally launched by sony in late 1998 . in addition to the original memory stick , this family includes the memory stick pro , a revision that allows greater maximum storage capacity and faster file transfer speeds ; memory stick duo , a small-form-factor version of the memory stick ( including the pro duo ) ; the even smaller memory stick micro ( m2 ) , and the memory stick pro-hg , a high speed variant of the pro to be used in high-definition video and still cameras . as a proprietary format , sony exclusively used memory stick on its products in the 2000s such as cyber-shot digital cameras , handycam digital camcorders , wega and bravia tv sets , vaio pcs , early walkman digital audio players , and the playstation portable handheld game console , with the format being licensed to a few other companies early in its lifetime . with increasing popularity of sd card , in 2010 sony started to support the sd card format , which was seen as a sony loss in the memory-card format war . despite this , sony continued to support memory stick on certain devices .
