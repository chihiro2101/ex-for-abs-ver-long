the bobcat ( lynx rufus ) , also known as the red lynx , is a medium-sized cat native to north america . it ranges from southern canada , most of the contiguous united states to oaxaca in mexico . it is listed as least concern on the iucn red list since 2002 due to its wide distribution and large population . although it has been hunted extensively both for sport and fur , populations have proven resilient though declining in some areas . it has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped , stubby ( or '' bobbed '' ) tail , from which it derives its name . it is smaller on average than the canada lynx , with which it shares parts of its range , but is about twice as large as the cat . it is an adaptable predator inhabiting wooded areas , as well as semidesert , urban edge , forest edge , and swampland environments . it remains in some of its original range , but populations are vulnerable to local extinction by coyotes and domestic animals . though the bobcat prefers rabbits and hares , it hunts insects , chickens , goose and other birds , small rodents , and deer . prey selection depends on location and habitat , season , and abundance . like most cats , the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary , although with some overlap in home ranges . it uses several methods to territorial marking , including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces . the bobcat breeds from winter into spring and has a gestation period of about two months . two subspecies are recognised , one east of the great plains , and the other west of the great plains . they were probably separated during interglacial periods in the pleistocene by the aridification of the great plains . it first appeared during the irvingtonian stage around . it features in some stories of the indigenous peoples of north and central america , and in the folklore of european colonizers .
