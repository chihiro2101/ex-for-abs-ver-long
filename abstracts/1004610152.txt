a heavy fighter is a historic category of fighter aircraft produced in the 1930s and 1940s and designed to carry heavier weapons , and/or operate at longer ranges , than light fighter aircraft . to achieve acceptable performance , most heavy fighters were twin-engine , and many had multi-place crews . in germany , they were known as zerst√∂rer ( '' destroyer '' ) . the twin-engine heavy fighter was a major design class during the pre-world war ii period , conceived as long-range escort fighters or heavily armed bomber destroyers . most such designs failed in this mission , as they could not maneuver with the more conventional , single-engine fighters , and suffered heavy losses . most notable among such designs was the messerschmitt bf 110 , which suffered great losses during the battle of britain . an exception was the american lockheed p-38 lightning , which proved to be an effective heavy fighter ; even against smaller , lighter , single-engine aircraft and particularly in the pacific theater . many twin-engine heavy fighters eventually found their niche as night fighters , especially in the bomber destroyer role ; or as fighter-bombers , roughly analogous to modern strike fighters . notable among such conversions was the bf 110 , which served as a relatively successful night fighter for most of the war , and the bristol beaufighter , which emerged as a major anti-shipping strike fighter of the royal air force .
