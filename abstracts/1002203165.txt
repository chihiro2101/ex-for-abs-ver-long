maid marian and her merry men is a british television series created and written by tony robinson and directed by david bell . it began in 1989 on bbc one and ran for four series , with the last episode shown in 1994 . the show was a partially musical comedy retelling of the legend of robin hood , placing maid marian in the role of leader of the merry men , and reducing robin to an incompetent ex-tailor . the programme was much appreciated by children and adults alike , and has been likened to blackadder , not only for its historical setting and the presence of tony robinson ( as well as early , uncredited , script editing work being undertaken by richard curtis ) , but also for its comic style . it is more surreal than blackadder , however , and drops even more ( deliberate ) anachronisms . many of the show 's cast such as howard lew lewis , forbes collins , ramsay gilderdale and patsy byrne had previously appeared in various episodes of blackadder alongside robinson . like many british children 's programmes , there is a lot of social commentary sneakily inserted , as well as witty asides about the royal family , buses running on time , etc . many of the plots spoofed or referenced film and television shows including other incarnations of robin hood in those media . the show was such a success that there was an adaptation produced for the stage and a cartoon strip by paul cemmick which was serialised in the daily telegraphs children 's paper '' the young telegraph '' ( also available as a series of collections ) , and the programme was repeated on bbc one in 2001 . series 1 was released on video in 1990 and 1993 , with three episodes each on four tapes , and all four series are available on dvd . it was repeated in april 2002 on the cbbc channel and the first series was repeated in june 2007 at 12:30 on the cbbc channel . during the summer of 2009 , gold repeated the entire 4 series .
