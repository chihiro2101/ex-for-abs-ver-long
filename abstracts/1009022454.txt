klezmer is an instrumental musical tradition of the ashkenazi jews of central and eastern europe . the essential elements of the tradition include dance tunes , ritual melodies , and virtuosic improvisations played for listening ; these would have been played at weddings and other social functions . the musical genre incorporated elements of many other musical genres including ottoman ( especially greek and romanian ) music , baroque music , german and slavic folk dances , and religious jewish music . as the music arrived in the united states , it lost some of its traditional ritual elements and adopted elements of american big band and popular music . among the european-born klezmers who popularized the genre in the united states in the 1910s and 1920s were dave tarras and naftule brandwein ; they were followed by american-born musicians such as max epstein , sid beckerman and ray musiker . after the destruction of jewish life in eastern europe during the holocaust , and a general fall in the popularity of klezmer music in the united states , the music began to be popularized again in the late 1970s in the so-called klezmer revival . during the 1980s and onwards , musicians experimented with traditional and experimental forms of the genre , releasing fusion albums combining the genre with jazz , punk , and other styles .
