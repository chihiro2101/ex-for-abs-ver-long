a night fighter ( also known as all-weather fighter or all-weather interceptor for a period of time after the second world war winchester 2006 , p . 184 . ) is a fighter aircraft adapted for use at night or in other times of bad visibility . night fighters began to be used in world war i and included types that were specifically modified to operate at night . during second world war , night fighters were either purpose-built night fighter designs , or more commonly , heavy fighters or light bombers adapted for the mission , often employing radar or other systems for providing some sort of detection capability in low visibility . many night fighters of the conflict also included instrument landing systems for landing at night , as turning on the runway lights made runways into an easy target for opposing intruders . some experiments tested the use of day fighters on night missions , but these tended to work only under very favourable circumstances and were not widely successful . avionics systems were greatly miniaturised over time , allowing the addition of radar altimeter , terrain-following radar , improved instrument landing system , microwave landing system , doppler weather radar , loran receivers , gee , tacan , inertial navigation system , gps , and gnss in aircraft . the addition of greatly improved landing and navigation equipment combined with radar led to the use of the term all-weather fighter or all-weather fighter attack , depending on the aircraft capabilities . the use of the term night fighter gradually faded away as a result of these improvements making the vast majority of fighters capable of night operation .
