the royal philharmonic orchestra ( rpo ) , based in london , was formed by thomas beecham in 1946 . in its early days , the orchestra secured profitable recording contracts and important engagements including the glyndebourne festival opera and the concerts of the royal philharmonic society . after beecham 's death in 1961 the orchestra 's fortunes declined steeply ; it battled for survival until the mid-1960s , when its future was secured after an arts council report recommended that it should receive public subsidy ; a further crisis arose in the same era when it seemed that the orchestra 's right to call itself '' royal '' could be withdrawn . since beecham 's death , the rpo has had seven chief conductors , including rudolf kempe , antal doráti , andré previn and vladimir ashkenazy . others closely associated with the orchestra have included charles groves , charles mackerras , peter maxwell davies , yehudi menuhin and leopold stokowski . in 2004 , the orchestra acquired its first permanent london base , at the new cadogan hall in chelsea . the rpo also gives concerts at the royal festival hall , the royal albert hall and venues around the uk and other countries . from its earliest days , the orchestra has been active in the recording studios , making film soundtracks and numerous gramophone recordings ; many of the lp recordings conducted by beecham and others have been reissued on compact disc .
