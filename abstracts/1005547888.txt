the law of the instrument , law of the hammer , maslow 's hammer ( or gavel ) , or golden hammer is a cognitive bias that involves an over-reliance on a familiar tool . as abraham maslow said in 1966 , '' i suppose it is tempting , if the only tool you have is a hammer , to treat everything as if it were a nail . '' the concept is attributed both to maslow and to abraham kaplan , although the hammer and nail line may not be original to either of them .
