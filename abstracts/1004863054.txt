jacob joseph frank ; ; born jakub lejbowicz ; 1726 – december 10 , 1791 ) was an 18th-century polish jews religious leader who claimed to be the reincarnation of the self-proclaimed messiah sabbatai zevi ( 1626–1676 ) and also of the biblical patriarch jacob . the jewish authorities in poland excommunicated frank and his followers due to his heretical doctrines that included deification of himself as a part of a trinity and other controversial concepts such as neo-carpocratian '' purification through transgression '' . maciejko ( 2003 ) frank arguably created a new denomination of judaism , now referred to as frankism , which incorporated some aspects of christianity into judaism . the development of frankism was one of the consequences of the messianic movement of sabbatai zevi . this religious mysticism followed socioeconomic changes among the jews of poland , lithuania and ruthenia .
