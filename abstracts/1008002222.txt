saturnalia was an roman festival and holiday in honour of the god saturn , held on 17 december of the julian calendar and later expanded with festivities through to 23 december . the holiday was celebrated with a sacrifice at the temple of saturn , in the roman forum , and a public banquet , followed by private gift-giving , continual partying , and a carnival atmosphere that overturned roman social norms : gambling was permitted , and masters provided table service for their slaves as it was seen as a time of liberty for both slaves and freedmen alike . miller , john f . '' roman festivals , '' in the oxford encyclopedia of ancient greece and rome ( oxford university press , 2010 ) , p . 172 . a common custom was the election of a '' king of the saturnalia '' , who would give orders to people , which were to be followed and preside over the merrymaking . the gifts exchanged were usually gag gifts or small figurines made of wax or pottery known as sigillaria . the poet catullus called it '' the best of days '' . catullus 14.15 ( optimo dierum ) , as cited by saturnalia was the roman equivalent to the earlier greek holiday of kronia , which was celebrated during the attic month of hekatombaion in late midsummer . it held theological importance for some romans , who saw it as a restoration of the ancient golden age , when the world was ruled by saturn . the neoplatonism philosopher porphyry interpreted the freedom associated with saturnalia as symbolizing the '' freeing of souls into immortality '' . saturnalia may have influenced some of the customs associated with later celebrations in western europe occurring in midwinter , particularly traditions associated with christmas , the feast of the holy innocents , and epiphany . in particular , the historical western european christmas custom of electing a '' lord of misrule '' may have its roots in saturnalia celebrations .
