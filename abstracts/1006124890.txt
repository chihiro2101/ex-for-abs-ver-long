in biology , the active site is region of an enzyme where substrate molecules bind and undergo a chemical reaction . the active site consists of amino acid that form temporary bonds with the substrate ( binding site ) and residues that catalyse a reaction of that substrate ( catalytic site ) . although the active site occupies only ~10â€“20 % of the volume of an enzyme , it is the most important part as it directly catalyzes the chemical reaction . it usually consists of three to four amino acids , while other amino acids within the protein are required to maintain the tertiary structure of the enzyme . each active site is evolved to be optimised to bind a particular substrate and catalyse a particular reaction , resulting in high specificity . this specificity is determined by the arrangement of amino acids within the active site and the structure of the substrates . sometimes enzymes also need to bind with some cofactors to fulfil their function . the active site is usually a groove or pocket of the enzyme which can be located in a deep tunnel within the enzyme , or between the interfaces of multimeric enzymes . an active site can catalyse a reaction repeatedly as residues are not altered at the end of the reaction ( they may change during the reaction , but are regenerated by the end ) . this process is achieved by lowering the activation energy of the reaction , so more substrates have enough energy to undergo reaction .
