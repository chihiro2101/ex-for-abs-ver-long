thumb a parabolic ( or paraboloid or paraboloidal ) reflector ( or dish or mirror ) is a mirror surface used to collect or project energy such as light , sound , or radio waves . its shape is part of a circular paraboloid , that is , the surface generated by a parabola revolving around its axis . the parabolic reflector transforms an incoming plane wave traveling along the axis into a spherical wave converging toward the focus . conversely , a spherical wave generated by a point source placed in the focus is reflected into a plane wave propagating as a collimated beam along the axis . parabolic reflectors are used to collect energy from a distant source ( for example sound waves or incoming star light ) . since the principles of reflection are reversible , parabolic reflectors can also be used to collimate radiation from an isotropic source into a parallel beam . in optics , parabolic mirrors are used to gather light in reflecting telescopes and solar furnaces , and project a beam of light in flashlights , searchlights , stage spotlights , and headlight . in radio parabolic antennas are used to radiate a narrow beam of radio waves for point-to-point communications in satellite dishes and microwave relay stations , and to locate aircraft , ships , and vehicles in radar sets . in acoustics , parabolic microphones are used to record faraway sounds such as bird calls , in sports reporting , and to eavesdrop on private conversations in espionage and law enforcement .
