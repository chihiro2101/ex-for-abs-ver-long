quantum indeterminacy is the apparent necessary incompleteness in the description of a physical system , that has become one of the characteristics of the standard description of quantum physics . prior to quantum physics , it was thought that : ( a ) a physical system had a determinate state which uniquely determined all the values of its measurable properties , and conversely : ( b ) the values of its measurable properties uniquely determined the state . quantum indeterminacy can be quantitatively characterized by a probability distribution on the set of outcomes of measurements of an observable . the distribution is uniquely determined by the system state , and moreover quantum mechanics provides a recipe for calculating this probability distribution . indeterminacy in measurement was not an innovation of quantum mechanics , since it had been established early on by experimentalists that errors in measurement may lead to indeterminate outcomes . however , by the later half of the eighteenth century , measurement errors were well understood and it was known that they could either be reduced by better equipment or accounted for by statistical error models . in quantum mechanics , however , indeterminacy is of a much more fundamental nature , having nothing to do with errors or disturbance .
