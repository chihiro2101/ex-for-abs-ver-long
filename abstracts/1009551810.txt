christian art is sacred art which uses themes and imagery from christianity . most christian groups use or have used art to some extent , although some have had aniconism in christianity , and there have been major periods of iconoclasm within christianity . images of jesus and narrative scenes from the life of christ are the most common subjects , and scenes from the old testament play a part in the art of most denominations . images of the virgin mary and saints are much rarer in protestant art than that of catholic church and orthodox church . christianity makes far wider use of images than related religions , in which figurative representations are forbidden , such as islam and judaism . however , there is also a considerable history of aniconism in christianity from various periods .
