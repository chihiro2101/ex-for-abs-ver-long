a natural experiment is an empirical study in which individuals ( or clusters of individuals ) are exposed to the experimental and control conditions that are determined by nature or by other factors outside the control of the investigators . the process governing the exposures arguably resembles random assignment . thus , natural experiments are observational studies and are not controlled in the traditional sense of a randomized experiment ( an intervention study ) . natural experiments are most useful when there has been a clearly defined exposure involving a well defined subpopulation ( and the absence of exposure in a similar subpopulation ) such that changes in outcomes may be plausibly attributed to the exposure . in this sense , the difference between a natural experiment and a non-experimental observational study is that the former includes a comparison of conditions that pave the way for causal inference , but the latter does not . natural experiments are employed as study designs when controlled experimentation is extremely difficult to implement or unethical , such as in several research areas addressed by epidemiology ( like evaluating the health impact of varying degrees of exposure to ionizing radiation in people living near hiroshima at the time of the atomic blast ) and economics ( like estimating the economic return on amount of schooling in us adults ) .
