toxicity is the degree to which a chemical substance or a particular mixture of substances can damage an organism . toxicity can refer to the effect on a whole organism , such as an animal , bacteria , or plant , as well as the effect on a substructure of the organism , such as a cell ( cytotoxicity ) or an organ such as the liver ( hepatotoxicity ) . by extension , the word may be metaphorically used to describe toxic effects on larger and more complex groups , such as the family unit or society at large . sometimes the word is more or less synonymous with poisoning in everyday usage . a central concept of toxicology is that the effects of a toxicant are dose-dependent ; even water can lead to water intoxication when taken in too high a dose , whereas for even a very toxic substance such as snake venom there is a dose below which there is no detectable toxic effect . considering the limitations of this dose-response concept , a novel drug toxicity index ( dti ) has been proposed recently . dti redefines drug toxicity , identifies hepatotoxic drugs , gives mechanistic insights , predicts clinical outcomes and has potential as a screening tool . toxicity is species-specific , making cross-species analysis problematic . newer paradigms and metrics are evolving to bypass animal testing , while maintaining the concept of toxicity endpoints .
