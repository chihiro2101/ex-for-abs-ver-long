the merrimack river ( or merrimac river , an occasional earlier spelling ) is a river in the northeastern united states . it rises at the confluence of the pemigewasset and winnipesaukee rivers in franklin , new hampshire , flows southward into massachusetts , and then flows northeast until it empties into the gulf of maine at newburyport . from pawtucket falls in lowell , massachusetts , onward , the northern boundary of massachusetts is roughly calculated as the line three miles north of the river . the merrimack is an important regional focus in both new hampshire and massachusetts . the central-southern part of new hampshire and most of northeast massachusetts is known as the merrimack valley . several u.s . naval ships have been named and uss merrimac in honor of this river . the river is perhaps best known for the early american literary classic a week on the concord and merrimack rivers by henry david thoreau .
