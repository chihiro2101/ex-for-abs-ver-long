in geology , a fault is a planar fracture or discontinuity in a volume of rock across which there has been significant displacement as a result of rock-mass movements . large faults within the earth 's crust result from the action of plate tectonic forces , with the largest forming the boundaries between the plates , such as subduction or transform faults . energy release associated with rapid movement on active faults is the cause of most earthquakes . faults may also displace slowly , by aseismic creep . a fault plane is the plane that represents the fracture surface of a fault . a fault trace or fault line is a place where the fault can be seen or mapped on the surface . a fault trace is also the line commonly plotted on geologic maps to represent a fault . . a fault zone is a cluster of parallel faults . zone . ‚Äù merriam-webster.com dictionary , merriam-webster . accessed 8 oct . 2020 . however , the term is also used for the zone of crushed rock along a single fault . prolonged motion along closely spaced faults can blur the distinction , as the rock between the faults is converted to fault-bound lenses of rock and then progressively crushed .
