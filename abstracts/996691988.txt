a one-instruction set computer ( oisc ) , sometimes called an ultimate risc ( urisc ) , is an abstract machine that uses only one instructionobviating the need for a machine language opcode . with a judicious choice for the single instruction and given infinite resources , an oisc is capable of being a universal computer in the same manner as traditional computers that have multiple instructions . oiscs have been recommended as aids in teaching computer architecture and have been used as computational models in structural computing research .
