the advanced scientific computer ( asc ) is a supercomputer designed and manufactured by texas instruments ( ti ) between 1966 and 1973 . the asc 's central processing unit ( cpu ) supported vector processor , a performance-enhancing technique which was key to its high-performance . the asc , along with the control data corporation star-100 supercomputer ( which was introduced in the same year ) , were the first computers to feature vector processing . however , this technique 's potential was not fully realized by either the asc or star-100 due to an insufficient understanding of the technique ; it was the cray research cray-1 supercomputer , announced in 1975 that would fully realize and popularize vector processing . the more successful implementation of vector processing in the cray-1 would demarcate the asc ( and star-100 ) as first-generation vector processors , with the cray-1 belonging in the second .
