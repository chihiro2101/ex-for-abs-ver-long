the boeing 2707 was an american supersonic transport ( sst ) project . after winning a competition for a government-funded contract to build an american sst , boeing began development at its facilities in seattle , washington . the design emerged as a large aircraft with seating for 250 to 300 passengers and cruise speeds of approximately mach 3 . it was intended to be much larger and faster than preceding sst designs such as concorde . the sst was the topic of considerable concern within and outside the aviation industry . from the start , the airline industry had noted that the economics of the design were questionable , concerns that were only partially addressed during development . outside the field , the entire sst concept was the subject of considerable negative press , centered on the issue of sonic booms and effects on the ozone layer . a key design feature of the 2707 was its use of a swing wing configuration . during development the required weight and size of this mechanism continued to grow , forcing the team to start over using a conventional delta wing . rising costs and the lack of a clear market led to its cancellation in 1971 before two prototypes had been completed .
