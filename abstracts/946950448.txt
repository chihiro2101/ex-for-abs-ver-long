in printing , type metal ( sometimes called hot metal ) refers to the metal alloys used in traditional movable type and hot metal typesetting . historically , type metal was an alloy of lead , tin and antimony in different proportions depending on the application , be it individual character mechanical casting for hand setting , mechanical line casting or individual character mechanical typesetting and stereo plate casting . the proportions used are in the range : lead 50‒86 % , antimony 11‒30 % and tin 3‒20 % . antimony and tin are added to lead for durability while reducing the difference between the coefficients of expansion of the matrix and the alloy . apart from durability , the general requirements for type-metal are that it should produce a true and sharp cast , and retain correct dimensions and form after cooling down . it should also be easy to cast , at reasonable low melting point , iron should not dissolve in the molten metal , and mould and nozzles should stay clean and easy to maintain . today , monotype machines can utilize a wide range of different alloys . mechanical linecasting equipment use alloys that are close to eutectic .
