andromeda is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century greco-roman astronomer ptolemy , and one of the 88 modern constellations . located north of the celestial equator , it is named for andromeda ( mythology ) , in the greek myth , who was chained to a rock to be eaten by the sea monster cetus . andromeda is most prominent during autumn evenings in the northern hemisphere , along with several other constellations named for characters in the perseus myth . because of its northern declination , andromeda is visible only north of 40Â° south latitude ; for observers farther south , it lies below the horizon . it is one of the largest constellations , with an area of 722 square degrees . this is over 1,400 times the size of the full moon , 55 % of the size of the largest constellation , hydra , and over 10 times the size of the smallest constellation , crux . its brightest star , alpha andromedae , is a binary star that has also been counted as a part of pegasus , while gamma andromedae is a colorful binary and a popular target for amateur astronomers . only marginally dimmer than alpha , beta andromedae is a red giant , its color visible to the naked eye . the constellation 's most obvious deep-sky object is the naked-eye andromeda galaxy ( m31 , also called the great galaxy of andromeda ) , the closest spiral galaxy to the milky way and one of the brightest messier objects . several fainter galaxies , including m31 's companions m110 and m32 , as well as the more distant ngc 891 , lie within andromeda . the blue snowball nebula , a planetary nebula , is visible in a telescope as a blue circular object . in chinese astronomy , the stars that make up andromeda were members of four different constellations that had astrological and mythological significance ; a constellation related to andromeda also exists in hindu mythology . andromeda is the location of the radiant for the andromedids , a weak meteor shower that occurs in november .
