thumb a transform fault or transform boundary is a fault along a plate boundary where the motion is predominantly horizontal . it ends abruptly where it connects to another plate boundary , either another transform , a spreading ridge , or a subduction . most such faults are found in oceanic crust , where they accommodate the lateral offset between segments of divergent boundary , forming a zigzag pattern . this is a result of oblique seafloor spreading where the direction of motion is not perpendicular to the trend of the overall divergent boundary . a smaller number of such faults are found on land , although these are generally better-known , such as the san andreas fault and north anatolian fault . a transform fault is a special case of a strike-slip fault that also forms a plate boundary .
