a fourth 'shape ' , known as 'puck ' because it appears to be a hybrid of pike and tuck , is often used in multiple twisting somersaults—it is typically used in place of a 'tuck ' and in the competition would normally be judged as an open tuck shape . a straddle or straddled pike is a variant of a pike with arms and legs spread wide and is only recognized as a move as a shaped jump and not in any somersault moves . rotation is performed about the body 's longitudinal and lateral axes , producing twists and somersaults respectively . twists are done in multiples of a half and somersaults in multiples of a quarter . for example , a barani ball out move consists of a take-off from the back followed by a tucked 1¼ & nbsp ; front somersault combined with a ½ & nbsp ; twist , to land on feet . rotation around the dorso-ventral axis is also possible ( producing side-somersaults and turntables ) , but these are not generally considered to be valid moves within competitions and carry no 'tariff ' for difficulty . trampoline skills can be written in fig ( federation internationale de gymnastique ) shorthand . fig shorthand consists of one digit signifying the number of quarter rotations , followed by digits representing the number of half twists in each somersault , and a symbol representing the position of the skill .
