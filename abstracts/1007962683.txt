zygomycota , or zygote fungi , is a former phylum or phylum of the kingdom fungi . the members are now part of two phyla the mucoromycota and zoopagomycota . approximately 1060 species are known . they are mostly terrestrial in habitat , living in soil or on decaying plant or animal material . some are parasites of plants , insects , and small animals , while others form symbiotic relationships with plants . zygomycete hyphae may be coenocyte , forming septa only where gametes are formed or to wall off dead hyphae . zygomycota is no longer recognised as it was not believed to be truly monophyletic .
