the burnside problem , posed by william burnside in 1902 and one of the oldest and most influential questions in group theory , asks whether a finitely generated group in which every element has finite order must necessarily be a finite group . evgeny golod and igor shafarevich provided a counter-example in 1964 . the problem has many variants ( see bounded and restricted below ) that differ in the additional conditions imposed on the orders of the group elements .
