in optics , the f-number of an optical system such as a camera lens is the ratio of the system 's focal length to the diameter of the entrance pupil ( '' clear aperture '' ) . smith , warren modern optical engineering , 4th ed . , 2007 mcgraw-hill professional , p . 183 . it is also known as the focal ratio , f-ratio , or f-stop , and is very important in photography . smith , warren modern lens design 2005 mcgraw-hill . it is a dimensionless number that is a quantitative measure of lens speed ; increasing the f-number is referred to as stopping down . the f-number is commonly indicated using a lower-case ƒ with the format n , where n is the f-number . the f-number is the reciprocal of the relative aperture ( the aperture diameter divided by focal length ) . iso , photography—apertures and related properties pertaining to photographic lenses—designations and measurements , iso 517:2008
