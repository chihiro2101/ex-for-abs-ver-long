dom duarte pio , duke of braganza ( duarte pio joão miguel gabriel rafael ; born 15 may 1945 ) is a claimant to the defunct portuguese throne , as the head of the house of braganza . the miguelist braganzas , to whom duarte pio belongs as great-grandson of king miguel i , is a cadet branch of the house of braganza . with the extinction of male-line dynasts descended from queen maria ii in 1932 , king miguel 's descendants became the only male-line braganzas remaining and the closest male-line heirs to the defunct portuguese throne ( the brazilian branch having gone extinct in 1921 ) . duarte pio is a figure within the european network of royal houses , often being invited to various foreign royal events . despite his support for a monarchical government and widespread recognition as pretender to the throne , there are no major movements or parties that support restoration of the monarchy . in 1995 , the duke married isabel , duchess of braganza , a portuguese businesswoman and descendant of portuguese nobility . their marriage was the first marriage of a portuguese royal to happen in portuguese territory since the marriage of king carlos i and amélie of orléans , in 1886 . the duke and duchess have three children , thus continuing the line of the braganzas , as neither of the duke 's brothers has married or had children .
