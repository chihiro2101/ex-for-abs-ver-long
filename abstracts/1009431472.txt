general john burgoyne ( 24 february 1722 â€“ 4 august 1792 ) was a british army officer , dramatist and politician who sat in the house of commons from 1761 to 1792 . he first saw action during the seven years ' war when he participated in several battles , most notably during the portugal campaign of 1762 . burgoyne is best known for his role in the american revolutionary war . he designed an invasion scheme and was appointed to command a force moving south from canada to split away new england and end the rebellion . burgoyne advanced from canada but his slow movement allowed the americans to concentrate their forces . instead of coming to his aid according to the overall plan , the british army in new york city moved south to capture philadelphia . burgoyne fought two small battles near saratoga but was surrounded by american forces and , with no relief in sight , surrendered his entire army of 6,200 men on 17 october 1777 . his surrender , says historian edmund morgan , '' was a great turning point of the war , because it won for americans the foreign assistance which was the last element needed for victory . '' he and his officers returned to england ; the enlisted men became prisoners of war . burgoyne came under sharp criticism when he returned to london , and never held another active command . burgoyne was also an accomplished playwright , known for his works such as the maid of the oaks and the heiress , but his plays never reached the fame of his military career . he served as a member of the house of commons for a number of years , sitting for the seats of midhurst and preston .
