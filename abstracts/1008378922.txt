frederick griffith ( 1877â€“1941 ) was a british bacteriologist whose focus was the epidemiology and pathology of bacterial pneumonia . in january 1928 he reported what is now known as griffith 's experiment , the first widely accepted demonstrations of bacterial transformation , whereby a bacterium distinctly changes its form and function . he showed that streptococcus pneumoniae , implicated in many cases of lobar pneumonia , could transform from one strain into a different strain . the observation was attributed to an unidentified transforming principle or transforming factor . this was later identified as dna . america 's leading pneumococcal researcher , oswald t . avery , speculated that griffith had failed to apply adequate controls . a cautious and thorough researcher , and a reticent individual , griffith 's tendency was to publish only findings that he believed truly significant , and griffith 's findings were rapidly confirmed by researchers in avery 's laboratory . his discovery was one of the first to show the central role of dna in heredity .
