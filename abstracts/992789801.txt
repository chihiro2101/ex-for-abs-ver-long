in geometry , the nine-point circle is a circle that can be constructed for any given triangle . it is so named because it passes through nine significant concyclic points defined from the triangle . these nine points are : the midpoint of each side of the triangle the foot of each altitude the midpoint of the line segment from each vertex of the triangle to the orthocenter ( where the three altitudes meet ; these line segments lie on their respective altitudes ) . the nine-point circle is also known as feuerbach 's circle , euler 's circle , terquem 's circle , the six-points circle , the twelve-points circle , the n-point circle , the medioscribed circle , the mid circle or the circum-midcircle . its center is the nine-point center of the triangle . kocik and solecki ( sharers of a 2010 lester r . ford award ) give a proof of the nine-point circle theorem .
