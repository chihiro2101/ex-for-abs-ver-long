an optical telegraph is a semaphore system using a line of stations , typically towers , for the purpose of conveying textual information by means of visual signals . there are two main types of such systems ; the semaphore telegraph which uses pivoted indicator arms and conveys information according to the direction the indicators point , and the shutter telegraph which uses panels that can be rotated to block or pass the light from the sky behind to convey information . the most widely used system was invented in 1792 in france by claude chappe , and was popular in the late eighteenth to early nineteenth centuries . this system is often referred to as semaphore without qualification . lines of relay towers with a semaphore rig at the top were built within line of sight of each other , at separations of . operators at each tower would watch the neighboring tower through a telescope , and when the semaphore arms began to move spelling out a message , they would pass the message on to the next tower . this system was much faster than post riders for conveying a message over long distances , and also had cheaper long-term operating costs , once constructed . half a century later , semaphore lines were replaced by the electrical telegraph , which was cheaper , faster , and more private . the line-of-sight distance between relay stations was limited by geography and weather , and prevented the optical telegraph from crossing wide expanses of water , unless a convenient island could be used for a relay station . a modern derivative of the semaphore system is flag semaphore , signalling with hand-held flags .
