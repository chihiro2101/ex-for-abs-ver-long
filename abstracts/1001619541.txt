image : perovskite.jpg thumb structure of a perovskite with general chemical formula abx 3 . the red spheres are x atoms ( usually oxygens ) , the blue spheres are b atoms ( a smaller metal cation , such as ti 4+ ) , and the green spheres are the a atoms ( a larger metal cation , such as ca 2+ ) . pictured is the undistorted cubic structure ; the symmetry is lowered to orthorhombic , tetragonal or trigonal in many perovskites . a perovskite is any material with a crystal structure similar to the perovskite , which consists of calcium titanium oxide ( catio 3 ) . the mineral was first discovered in the ural mountains of russia by gustav rose in 1839 and named after russian mineralogist l . a . perovski ( 1792â€“1856 ) . the general chemical formula for perovskite compounds is abx 3 , where ' a ' and ' b ' are two cations , often of very different sizes , and x is an anion ( frequently oxide ) that bonds to both cations . the ' a ' atoms are generally larger than the ' b ' atoms . the ideal cubic structure has the b cation in 6-fold coordination , surrounded by an octahedron of anions , and the a cation in 12-fold cuboctahedron coordination . as one of the most abundant structural families , perovskites are found in an enormous number of compounds which have wide-ranging properties , applications and importance . natural compounds with this structure are perovskite , loparite , and the silicate perovskite bridgmanite . bridgemanite on mindat.org since the discovery of perovskite solar cell , which contain methylammonium lead halide perovskites in 2009 there has been considerable research interest into perovskite materials .
