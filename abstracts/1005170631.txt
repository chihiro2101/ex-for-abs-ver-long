thrombosis ( from ancient greek '' clotting ‚Äù ) is the formation of a thrombus inside a blood vessel , obstructing the flow of blood through the circulatory system . when a blood vessel ( a vein or an artery ) is injured , the body uses platelets ( thrombocytes ) and fibrin to form a blood clot to prevent blood loss . even when a blood vessel is not injured , blood clots may form in the body under certain conditions . a clot , or a piece of the clot , that breaks free and begins to travel around the body is known as an embolus . thrombosis may occur in veins ( venous thrombosis ) or in arteries ( arterial thrombosis ) . venous thrombosis leads to congestion of the affected part of the body , while arterial thrombosis ( and rarely severe venous thrombosis ) affects the blood supply and leads to damage of the tissue supplied by that artery ( ischemia and necrosis ) . a piece of either an arterial or a venous thrombus can break off as an embolus which can travel through the circulation and lodge somewhere else as an embolism . this type of embolism is known as a thromboembolism . complications can arise when a venous thrombosis ( commonly called a vte ) lodges in the lung as a pulmonary embolism . an arterial embolus may travel further down the affected blood vessel where it can lodge as an embolism .
