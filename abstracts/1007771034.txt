passing is the ability of a person to be regarded as a member of an identity ( social science ) different from their own , which may include racial identity , ethnicity , caste , social class , sexual orientation , gender , religion , age and/or disability passing may result in privileges , rewards , or an increase in social acceptance , or be used to cope with stigma . thus , passing may serve as a form of self-preservation or self-protection in instances where expressing one 's true or prior identity may be dangerous . passing may require acceptance into a community and may also lead to temporary or permanent leave from another community to which an individual previously belonged . thus , passing can result in separation from one 's original self , family , friends , or previous living experiences . while successful passing may contribute to economic security , safety , and avoidance of stigma , it may take an emotional toll as a result of denial of one 's previous identity and may lead to depression or self-loathing . etymology , the term is simply the nominalisation of the verb pass in its phrasal use with for or as , as in a counterfeit passing for the genuine article or an impostor passing as another person . it has been in popular use since at least the late 1920s .
