porphyrins are a group of heterocyclic macrocycle organic compounds , composed of four modified pyrrole subunits interconnected at their α carbon atoms via methine bridges ( ch− ) . the parent of porphyrin is porphine , a rare chemical compound of exclusively theoretical interest . substituted porphines are called porphyrins . with a total of 26 π-electrons , of which 18 π-electrons form a planar , continuous cycle , the porphyrin ring structure is often described as aromatic . one result of the large conjugated system is that porphyrins typically absorb strongly in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum , i.e . they are deeply colored . the name '' porphyrin '' derives from the greek word πορφύρα ( porphyra ) , meaning purple . metal complexes derived from porphyrins occur naturally . one of the best-known families of porphyrin complexes is heme , the pigment in red blood cells , a cofactor of the protein hemoglobin .
