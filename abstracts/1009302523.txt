eyes are organs of the visual system . they provide animals with vision , the ability to receive and process visual detail , as well as enabling several photo response functions that are independent of vision . eyes detect light and convert it into electro-chemical impulses in neurons . in higher organisms , the eye is a complex optics system which collects light from the surrounding environment , regulates its intensity through a diaphragm , focuses it through an adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image , converts this image into a set of electrical signals , and transmits these signals to the brain through complex neural pathways that connect the eye via the optic nerve to the visual system and other areas of the brain . eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms , and 96 % of animal species possess a complex optical system . image-resolving eyes are present in molluscs , chordates and arthropods . the most simple eyes , pit eyes , are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angles of light that enters and affects the eye-spot , to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light . from more complex eyes , retinal photosensitive ganglion cells send signals along the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nuclei to effect circadian adjustment and to the pretectal area to control the pupillary light reflex .
