in cryptanalysis , frequency analysis ( also known as counting letters ) is the study of the letter frequencies or groups of letters in a ciphertext . the method is used as an aid to breaking classical ciphers . frequency analysis is based on the fact that , in any given stretch of written language , certain letters and combinations of letters occur with varying frequencies . moreover , there is a characteristic distribution of letters that is roughly the same for almost all samples of that language . for instance , given a section of english language , , , and are the most common , while , , and are rare . likewise , , , , and are the most common pairs of letters ( termed bigrams or digraphs ) , and , , , and are the most common repeats . the nonsense phrase '' etaoin shrdlu '' represents the 12 most frequent letters in typical english language text . in some ciphers , such properties of the natural language plaintext are preserved in the ciphertext , and these patterns have the potential to be exploited in a ciphertext-only attack .
