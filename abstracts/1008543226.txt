s ( non-pigmented plastids that can sometimes differentiate ) . the event to permanent endosymbiosis in the archaeplastida clade ( of embryophyte , red algae , and green algae ) probably occurred with a cyanobiont ( a symbiotic cyanobacteria ) related to the genus gloeomargarita , around 1.5 billion years ago . a later primary endosymbiosis event occurred in photosynthetic paulinella amoeboids about 90â€“140 million years ago , with the plastid being a sister to the '' ps-clade '' ( of the cyanobacteria genera prochlorococcus and synechococcus ) . secondary and tertiary endosymbiosis has also occurred , in a wide variety of organisms ; additionally , some organisms sequester ingested plastids in a process that is known as kleptoplasty . plastids were discovered and named by ernst haeckel , but a . f . w . schimper was the first to provide a clear definition . they often contain pigments used in photosynthesis , and the types of pigments in a plastid determine the cell 's color . they are also the site of manufacture and storage of important chemical compounds used by the cells of autotrophic eukaryotes . they possess a dna base pairing molecule that is circular , like that of the circular chromosome of prokaryotic cells .
