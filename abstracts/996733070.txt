the scalable coherent interface or scalable coherent interconnect ( sci ) , is a high-speed interconnect standard for shared memory multiprocessing and message passing . the goal was to scale well , provide system-wide memory coherence and a simple interface ; i.e . a standard to replace existing buses in multiprocessor systems with one with no inherent scalability and performance limitations . the ieee std 1596-1992 , ieee standard for scalable coherent interface ( sci ) was approved by the ieee standards board on march 19 , 1992 . it saw some use during the 1990s , but never became widely used and has been replaced by other systems from the early 2000s .
