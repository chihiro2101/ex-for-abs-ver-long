in computer science , a semaphore is a variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple processes and avoid critical section problems in a concurrent system such as a multitasking operating system . a trivial semaphore is a plain variable that is changed ( for example , incremented or decremented , or toggled ) depending on programmer-defined conditions . a useful way to think of a semaphore as used in a real-world system is as a record of how many units of a particular resource are available , coupled with operations to adjust that record safely ( i.e . , to avoid race condition ) as units are acquired or become free , and , if necessary , wait until a unit of the resource becomes available . semaphores are a useful tool in the prevention of race conditions ; however , their use is by no means a guarantee that a program is free from these problems . semaphores which allow an arbitrary resource count are called counting semaphores , while semaphores which are restricted to the values 0 and 1 ( or locked/unlocked , unavailable/available ) are called binary semaphores and are used to implement locks . the semaphore concept was invented by dutch computer scientist edsger dijkstra in 1962 or 1963 , ( undated , 1962 or 1963 ) when dijkstra and his team were developing an operating system for the electrologica x8 . that system eventually became known as the multiprogramming system .
