herzog explained how the choir-like sound was created , '' we used a strange instrument , which we called a 'mellotron . ' it has inside it three dozen different tapes running parallel to each other in loops . all these tapes are running at the same time , and there is a keyboard on which you can play them like an organ so that it will sound just like a human choir but yet , at the same time , very artificial and really quite eerie . '' in 1975 popol vuh released an album entitled aguirre . although ostensibly a soundtrack album to herzog 's film , the six-track lp included only two songs ( '' aguirre i ( l'acrime di rei ) '' and '' aguirre ii '' ) taken from aguirre , the wrath of god . the four remaining tracks were derived from various recordings made by the group between about 1972 and 1974 . at the time of aguirre the band members were fricke ( piano , mellotron ) , fichelscher ( electric guitar , acoustic guitar , drums ) , djong yun ( vocals ) , and robert eliscu ( oboe , pan pipe ) .
