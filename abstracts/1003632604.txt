jerky is lean trimmed meat that has been cut into strips and dried ( dehydrated ) to prevent spoilage . normally , this drying includes the addition of salt to prevent bacteria growth before the meat has finished the dehydrating process . the word '' jerky '' derives from the quechua word ch'arki which means '' dried , salted meat '' . teofilo laime ajacopa , diccionario bilingüe iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha , la paz , 2007 ( quechua-spanish dictionary ) all that is needed to produce basic '' jerky '' is a low-temperature drying method , and salt to inhibit bacterial growth . modern manufactured jerky is often marinated , prepared with a seasoned spice rub or liquid , or smoked with low heat ( usually under 70 & nbsp ; °c/160 & nbsp ; °f ) . store-bought jerky commonly includes sweeteners such as brown sugar . jerky is ready-to-eat , needs no additional preparation and can be stored for months without refrigeration . to ensure maximum shelf-life a proper protein-to-moisture content is required in the final cured product . many products which are sold as jerky consist of highly processed , chopped and formed meat rather than traditional sliced whole-muscle meat . these products may contain more fat , but moisture content , as in the whole-muscle product , must meet a 0.75 to 1 moisture-to protein ratio in the us . usda food standards and labeling policy book , p . 83 . chemical preservatives can prevent oxidative spoilage , but the moisture-to-protein ratio prevents microbial spoilage by low water activity . some jerky products are very high in sugar and therefore taste very sweet – unlike biltong , which rarely contains added sugars .
