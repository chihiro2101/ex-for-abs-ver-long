a video rental shop/store is a physical retail business that rents home videos such as movies , prerecorded tv shows , video game discs and other content . typically , a rental shop conducts business with customers under conditions and terms agreed upon in a rental agreement or contract , which may be implied , explicit , or written . many video rental stores also sell previously-viewed movies and/or new unopened movies . in the 1980s , video rental stores rented vhs and betamax tapes of movies , although most stores dropped beta tapes when vhs won the format war late in the decade . in the 2000s , video rental stores began renting dvds , a digital format with higher resolution than vhs . in the 2000s , stores began selling and renting blu-ray discs , a format that supports high definition . widespread adoption of video on demand and video streaming services such as netflix in the 2010s sharply reduced most major rental chains ' revenue , leading to the closure of many locations . due to significantly less demand , few rental shops have survived into the present day .
