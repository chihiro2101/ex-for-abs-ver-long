the very large telescope ( vlt ) is a telescope facility operated by the european southern observatory on cerro paranal in the atacama desert of northern chile . the vlt consists of four individual telescopes , each with a primary mirror 8.2 m across , which are generally used separately but can be used together to achieve very high angular resolution . the four separate optical telescopes are known as antu , kueyen , melipal , and yepun , which are all words for astronomical objects in the mapuche language . the telescopes form an array which is complemented by four movable auxiliary telescopes ( ats ) of 1.8 m aperture . the vlt operates at visible and infrared wavelengths . each individual telescope can detect objects roughly four billion times fainter than can be detected with the naked eye , and when all the telescopes are combined , the facility can achieve an angular resolution of about 0.002 arc-second . in single telescope mode of operation angular resolution is about 0.05 arc-second . the vlt is the most productive ground-based facility for astronomy , with only the hubble space telescope generating more scientific papers among facilities operating at visible wavelengths . among the pioneering observations carried out using the vlt are the first direct image of an exoplanet , the tracking of individual stars moving around the supermassive black hole at the centre of the milky way , and observations of the afterglow of the grb 090423 .
