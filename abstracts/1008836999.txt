birdwatching , or birding , is a form of wildlife observation in which the observation of birds is a recreational activity or citizen science . it can be done with the naked eye , through a visual enhancement device like binoculars and telescopes , by listening for bird sounds , or by watching public webcams . birdwatching often involves a significant auditory component , as many bird species are more easily detected and identified by ear than by eye . most birdwatchers pursue this activity for recreational or social reasons , unlike ornithology , who engage in the study of birds using formal scientific methods .
