in fluid dynamics , turbulence or turbulent flow is fluid motion characterized by chaotic changes in pressure and flow velocity . it is in contrast to a laminar flow , which occurs when a fluid flows in parallel layers , with no disruption between those layers . turbulence is commonly observed in everyday phenomena such as surf , fast flowing rivers , billowing storm clouds , or smoke from a chimney , and most fluid flows occurring in nature or created in engineering applications are turbulent . turbulence is caused by excessive kinetic energy in parts of a fluid flow , which overcomes the damping effect of the fluid 's viscosity . for this reason turbulence is commonly realized in low viscosity fluids . in general terms , in turbulent flow , unsteady vortices appear of many sizes which interact with each other , consequently drag due to friction effects increases . this increases the energy needed to pump fluid through a pipe . the onset of turbulence can be predicted by the dimensionless reynolds number , the ratio of kinetic energy to viscous damping in a fluid flow . however , turbulence has long resisted detailed physical analysis , and the interactions within turbulence create a very complex phenomenon . richard feynman has described turbulence as the most important unsolved problem in classical physics .
