stevenson wrote '' one more day '' about the death of his father , who he had taken in and cared for throughout the last year of his life : '' he and i always had a terrible relationship . we spent a good part of my adult life being somewhat estranged from each other . he became ill and i took care of him for a little while . and then he died . that song is just about his and my relationship . just to get that out of me and not holding it inside anymore , is a huge relief for me . every single time i hear that song , it just freaks me out . i 've never , ever written a song that 's freaked me out that much .
