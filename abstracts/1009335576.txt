marranos were spanish and portuguese jews living in the iberian peninsula who converted or were forced to convert to christianity during the middle ages , yet continued to crypto-judaism . the term specifically refers to the charge of crypto-judaism , whereas the term converso was used for the wider population of jewish converts to catholicism , whether or not they secretly still practised jewish rites . converts from either judaism or islam were referred to by the broader term of '' new christians '' . the term marrano came into later use in 1492 with the castilian alhambra decree , ordered by inquisitor torquemada , himself from a converso family . it prohibited the practice of judaism in spain and required all remaining jews to convert or leave , under the premise that , '' if they are not good christians , their descendants will be . '' by then , the vast majority of jews in spain had converted to catholicism , perhaps under pressure from the massacre of 1391 , and conversos numbered hundreds of thousands . they were monitored by the spanish inquisition and subject to suspicions by catholics of the secret practice of judaism , also known as '' marranism . '' in modern use '' marrano '' is sometimes , but not always , considered offensive ; and '' crypto-jew '' is occasionally preferred in scholarly works . karen primack , '' that word 'marrano ' '' . chapter 8 ( pp . 55-58 ) in karen primack ( ed . ) jews in places you never thought of , ktav publishing house , inc .
