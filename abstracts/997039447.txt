a cold cathode , cold cathode discharge tube is a cathode that is not electrically heated by a filament . a negatively charged electrode emits electrons or is the positively charged terminal . for more , see field emission . a cathode may be considered '' cold '' if it emits more electrons than can be supplied by thermionic emission alone . it is used in gas discharge lamp , such as neon lamps , discharge tubes , and some types of vacuum tube . the other type of cathode is a hot cathode , which is heated by electric current passing through a filament . a cold cathode does not necessarily operate at a low temperature : it is often heated to its operating temperature by other methods , such as the current passing from the cathode into the gas .
