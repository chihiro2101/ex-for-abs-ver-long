decomposition is the process by which dead organic substances are broken down into simpler organic or inorganic matter such as carbon dioxide , water , simple sugars and mineral salts . the process is a part of the nutrient cycle and is essential for recycling the finite matter that occupies physical space in the biosphere . bodies of organism begin to decompose shortly after death . animals , such as worms , also help decompose the organic materials . organisms that do this are known as decomposers . although no two organisms decompose in the same way , they all undergo the same sequential stages of decomposition . the science which studies decomposition is generally referred to as taphonomy from the greek word taphos , meaning tomb . decomposition can also be a gradual process for organisms that have extended periods of dormancy . one can differentiate abiotic from biotic substance ( biodegradation ) . the former means '' degradation of a substance by chemical or physical processes , e.g . , hydrolysis . water quality vocabulary . ishao 6107-6:1994 . the latter means '' the metabolic breakdown of materials into simpler components by living organisms '' , typically by microorganisms .
