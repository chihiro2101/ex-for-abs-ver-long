iva ikuko toguri d'aquino ( july 4 , 1916 â€“ september 26 , 2006 ) was an american who participated in english-language radio broadcasts transmitted by nhk to allied soldiers in the south pacific during world war ii on the zero hour radio show . toguri called herself '' orphan ann '' , but she quickly became inaccurately identified with the name '' tokyo rose '' , coined by allied soldiers and which predated her broadcasts . after the japanese surrender , toguri was detained for a year by the united states military before being released for lack of evidence . department of justice officials agreed that her broadcasts were '' innocuous '' , but when toguri tried to return to the u.s . a popular uproar ensued , prompting the federal bureau of investigation to renew its investigation of toguri 's wartime activities . she was subsequently charged by the united states attorney with eight counts of treason . her 1949 trial resulted in a conviction on one count , for which she spent more than six years out of a ten-year sentence in prison . journalistic and governmental investigators years later pieced together the history of irregularities with the indictment , trial , and conviction , including confessions from key witnesses who had perjured themselves at the various stages of their testimonies . toguri received a pardon in 1977 from u.s . president gerald ford .
