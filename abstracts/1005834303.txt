carl philipp stamitz ; baptized 8 may 17459 november 1801 ) was a german composer of partial czech ancestry . he was the most prominent representative of the second generation of the mannheim school . he was the eldest son of johann stamitz , a violinist and composer of the early classical period . born in mannheim , he received lessons from his father and christian cannabich , his father 's successor as leader of the mannheim orchestra . as a youth , stamitz was employed as a violinist in the court orchestra at mannheim . in 1770 , he began travelling as a virtuoso , accepting short-term engagements , but never managing to gain a permanent position . he visited a number of european cities , living for a time in strasbourg and london . in 1794 , he gave up travelling and moved with his family to jena in central germany , but his circumstances deteriorated and he descended into debt and poverty , dying in 1801 . papers on alchemy were found after his death . stamitz wrote symphony , sinfonia concertantes , and concertos for clarinet , cello , flute , oboe , bassoon , basset horn , violin , viola , viola d'amore and different combinations of these instruments . some of his clarinet and viola concertos are particularly admired . he also wrote duet , trios and quartets . two operas , der verliebte vormund and dardanus , are now lost . stylistically , his music resembles that of mozart or haydn and is characterized by appealing melody , although his writing for the solo instruments is not excessively virtuosic . the opening movements of his orchestral works , which are in sonata form , are generally followed by expressive and lyrical middle movements and final movements in the form of a rondo .
