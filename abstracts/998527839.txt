joseph hooker ( november 13 , 1814 – october 31 , 1879 ) was an american civil war general for the union , chiefly remembered for his decisive defeat by confederate general robert e . lee at the battle of chancellorsville in 1863 . hooker had served in the seminole wars and the mexican–american war , receiving three brevet promotions , before resigning from the army . at the start of the civil war , he joined the union side as a brigadier general , distinguishing himself at williamsburg , antietam and fredericksburg , after which he was given command of the army of the potomac . his ambitious plan for chancellorsville was thwarted by lee 's bold move in dividing his army and routing a union corps , as well as by mistakes on the part of hooker 's subordinate generals and his own loss of nerve . the defeat handed lee the initiative , which allowed him to travel north to gettysburg . hooker was kept in command , but when general halleck and lincoln declined his request for reinforcements , he resigned . george g . meade was appointed to command the army of the potomac three days before gettysburg . hooker returned to combat in november 1863 , helping to relieve the besieged union army at chattanooga , tennessee , and continuing in the western theater under maj . gen . william t . sherman , but departed in protest before the end of the atlanta campaign when he was passed over for promotion . hooker became known as '' fighting joe '' following a journalist 's clerical error , and the nickname stuck . his personal reputation was as a hard-drinking ladies ' man , and his headquarters were known for parties and gambling .
