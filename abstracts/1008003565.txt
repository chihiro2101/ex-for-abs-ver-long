lucius aelius sejanus ( 3 june 20 bc â€“ 18 october ad 31 ) , commonly known as sejanus , was an ambitious soldier , friend and confidant of the roman emperor tiberius . an equites by birth , sejanus rose to power as prefect of the roman imperial bodyguard , known as the praetorian guard , of which he was commander from ad 14 until his death in ad 31 . while the praetorian guard was formally established under emperor augustus , sejanus introduced a number of reforms which saw the unit evolve beyond a mere bodyguard , into a powerful and influential branch of the government involved in public security , civil administration and ultimately political intercession ; these changes would have a lasting impact on the course of the principate . during the 20s , sejanus gradually accumulated power by consolidating his influence over tiberius and eliminating potential political opponents , including the emperor 's son drusus julius caesar . when tiberius withdrew to capri in ad 26 , sejanus was left in control of the administration of the empire . for a time the most influential and feared citizen of rome , sejanus suddenly fell from power in ad 31 , the year his career culminated with the consulship . amidst suspicions of conspiracy against tiberius , sejanus was arrested and executed , along with his followers .
