the progress is a russian expendable cargo spacecraft . its purpose is to deliver the supplies needed to sustain a human presence in orbit . while it does not carry a crew , it can be boarded by astronauts when docked to a space station , hence it is classified as crewed by its manufacturer . progress is derived from the crewed soyuz spacecraft and launches on the same launch vehicle , a soyuz rocket . progress has supported space stations as early as salyut 6 and as recently as the international space station ( iss ) . each year there are between three and four progress flights to the iss . a progress remains docked until shortly before being replaced with a new one or a soyuz ( which will use the same docking port ) . then it is filled with waste , disconnected , and de-orbited , at which point it burns up in the atmosphere . due to the variation in progress vehicles flown to the iss , nasa uses its own nomenclature where '' iss 1p '' means the first progress spacecraft to iss . progress was developed because of the need for a constant source of supplies to make long duration space missions possible . it was determined that cosmonauts needed an inflow of consumables ( food , water , air , etc . ) , plus there was a need for maintenance items and scientific payloads that necessitated a dedicated cargo carrier . such payloads were impractical to launch with passengers in the restricted space of a soyuz . as of 15 february 2021 , there have been 168 progress flights with three failures . all three failures have occurred since 2011 .
