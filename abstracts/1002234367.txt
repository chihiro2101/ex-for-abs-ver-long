a lesser opportunity came through his father 's attorney , who recognised lilly 's level of education and recommended him to gilbert wright , master of the salters ' company and resident of the strand , london ( but formerly of market bosworth , leicestershire ) . wright was looking for a literate youth to act as his secretary and general servant , and at that time lilly 's father ( then in prison for debt ) was very happy to be rid of him , considering that since his son was no good around the farm , he was '' good for nothing '' . with his letter of recommendation and just a few shillings , eighteen-year-old lilly walked to london alongside a carrier 's cart , later recounting '' it was a very stormy week , cold and uncomfortable : i footed it all along '' . lilly received a warm welcome from gilbert wright , and worked as his servant until wright 's death in 1627 . his biography recounts how , during these seven years , he was happy to perform all manner of menial tasks for his master ; how he nursed gilbert 's wife through breast-cancer , until she died of the illness in 1624 ; how he survived the great plague of london in 1625 ; how his master married again in 1626 ( a widow named ellen whitehaire ) , and then settled upon lilly an annuity of Â£20 a year , before his death in may 1627 . within months of wright 's death , the newly widowed ellen made it clear that , having married twice for money , she was now looking to marry someone who would be loving and look after her , regardless of her suitor 's status . lilly took the '' audacious '' step of proposing himself , and despite her initial protestations that at 25 years of age lilly was too young , they married in september of that year , keeping their marriage secret from her friends and family for two years . lilly describes a contented marriage with ellen , which continued for six years . upon her death she left everything to lilly , of which he reports '' it was considerable , very near to the value of one thousand pounds '' .
