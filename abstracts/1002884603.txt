the battle of novi ( 15 august 1799 ) saw a combined army of the habsburg monarchy and russian empire under field marshal alexander suvorov attack a republican french army under general barthélemy catherine joubert . after a prolonged and bloody struggle , the austro-russians broke through the french defenses and drove their enemies into a disorderly retreat . joubert was killed while french division commanders catherine-dominique de pérignon and emmanuel grouchy were captured . novi ligure is in the province of piedmont in italy a distance of north of genoa . the battle occurred during the war of the second coalition which was part of the french revolutionary wars . in 1799 , russian and austrian forces swept across the po river valley , recapturing lands taken by napoleon bonaparte in 1796 . the french troops in italy were badly defeated at the major battles of magnano , cassano and the trebbia . subsequently , french and cisalpine italian troops retreated into genoa and the ligurian republic . a new french government placed joubert in command of the reformed army of italy and ordered him to take the offensive . accordingly , the french army moved north across the mountain crests and assembled on high ground at novi ligure on 14 august . to joubert 's dismay , it was clear that large coalition forces were nearby . the next morning paul kray 's austrian corps assaulted the french left flank and the battle was on . after a delay , suvorov committed a russian corps to attack the center and michael von melas ' austrian corps to attack the french right flank . kray 's troops suffered heavy losses but by evening the french army was badly beaten and the french hold on the italian riviera was gravely weakened . however , the coalition planners proceeded to throw away their advantage by sending suvorov 's russians to switzerland , a change of strategy that ended badly .
