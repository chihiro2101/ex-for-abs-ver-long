richard ap meryk , anglicised to richard amerike ( or ameryk ) 1440â€“1503 ) was an anglo-welsh merchant , royal customs officer and , at the end of his life , sheriff of bristol . several claims have been made for amerike by popular writers of the late twentieth century . one was that he was the major funder of the voyage of exploration launched from bristol by the venetian john cabot in 1497 , and that amerike was the owner of cabot 's ship , the matthew . the other claim revived a theory first proposed in 1908 by a bristolian scholar and amateur historian , alfred hudd . hudd 's theory , greatly elaborated by later writers , suggested that the continental name america was derived from amerike 's surname in gratitude for his sponsorship of cabot 's successful discovery expedition to the 'new world ' . however , neither claim is backed up by hard evidence , and the consensus view is that america is named after amerigo vespucci , the italian explorer .
