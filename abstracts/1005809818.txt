a compression artifact ( or artefact ) is a noticeable distortion of media ( including image , audio , and video ) caused by the application of lossy compression . lossy data compression involves discarding some of the media 's data so that it becomes small enough to be stored within the desired file size or data stream ( streamed ) within the available bandwidth ( known as the data rate or bit rate ) . if the compressor can not store enough data in the compressed version , the result is a loss of quality , or introduction of artifacts . the compression algorithm may not be intelligent enough to discriminate between distortions of little subjective importance and those objectionable to the user . the most common digital compression artifacts are dct blocks , caused by the discrete cosine transform ( dct ) compression algorithm used in many digital media standards , such as jpeg image compression , mp3 digital audio , and mpeg video coding formats . these compression artifacts appear when heavy compression is applied , and occur often in common digital media , such as dvds , common computer file formats such as jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files , and some alternatives to the compact disc , such as sony minidisc format . uncompressed media ( such as on laserdiscs , audio cds , and wav files ) or lossless compression media ( such as flac or png ) do not suffer from compression artifacts . the minimization of perceivable artifacts is a key goal in implementing a lossy compression algorithm . however , artifacts are occasionally intentionally produced for artistic purposes , a style known as glitch art or datamoshing . technically speaking , a compression artifact is a particular class of data error that is usually the consequence of quantization in lossy data compression . where transform coding is used , it typically assumes the form of one of the basis functions of the coder 's transform space .
