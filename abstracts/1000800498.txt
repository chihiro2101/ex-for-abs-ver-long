an ossuary is a chest , box , building , well , or site made to serve as the final resting place of human skeleton remains . they are frequently used where burial space is scarce . a body is first buried in a temporary grave , then after some years the skeletal remains are removed and placed in an ossuary ( '' os '' is '' bone '' in latin ) . the greatly reduced space taken up by an ossuary means that it is possible to store the remains of many more people in a single tomb than if the original coffins were left as is .
