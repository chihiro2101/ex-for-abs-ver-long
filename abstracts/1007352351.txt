the problem of induction is the philosophy question of what are the argument , if any , for any growth of knowledge understood in the justified true belief—knowledge that goes beyond a inductive reasoning —highlighting the apparent lack of justification in particular for : generalizing about the properties of a class of objects based on some number of observations of particular instances of that class ( e.g . , the inference that '' all swans we have seen are white , and , therefore , all swans are white '' , before the discovery of black swans ) or presupposing that a sequence of events in the future will occur as it always has in the past ( e.g . , that the laws of physics will hold as they have always been observed to hold ) . hume called this the principle of uniformitarianism . 9662 : most recently updated in 16 october 2007 the traditional inductivist view is that all claimed empirical laws , either in everyday life or through the scientific method , can be justified through some form of reasoning . the problem is that many philosophers tried to find such a justification but their proposals were not accepted by others . identifying the inductivist view as the scientific view , c . d . broad once said that '' induction is the glory of science and the scandal of philosophy '' . in contrast , karl popper 's critical rationalism claimed that inductive justifications are never used in science and proposed instead that science is based on the procedure of conjecturing hypotheses , deductively calculating consequences , and then empirically attempting to falsify them . the original source of what is known as the problem today was proposed by david hume in the mid-18th century , although inductive justifications were already argued against by the pyrrhonism school of hellenistic philosophy and the cārvāka school of ancient indian philosophy in a way that shed light on the problem of induction .
