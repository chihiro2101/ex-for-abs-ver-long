a general circulation model ( gcm ) is a type of climate model . it employs a mathematical model of the general circulation of a planetary atmosphere or ocean . it uses the navierâ€“stokes equations on a rotating sphere with thermodynamic terms for various energy sources ( radiation , latent heat ) . these equations are the basis for computer programs used to simulate the earth 's atmosphere or oceans . atmospheric and oceanic gcms ( agcm and ogcm ) are key components along with sea ice and land components . gcms and global climate models are used for weather forecasting , understanding the climate , and forecasting climate change . versions designed for decade to century time scale climate applications were originally created by syukuro manabe and kirk bryan at the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory ( gfdl ) in princeton , new jersey . these models are based on the integration of a variety of fluid dynamical , chemical and sometimes biological equations .
