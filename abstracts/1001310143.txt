un chien andalou , an andalusian dog ) is a 1929 franco-spanish silent surrealist short film by spanish director luis buñuel and artist salvador dalí . it was buñuel 's first film and was initially released in 1929 with a limited showing at studio des ursulines in paris , but became popular and ran for eight months . un chien andalou has no plot in the conventional sense of the word . the chronology of the film is disjointed , jumping from the initial '' once upon a time '' to '' eight years later '' without events or characters changing . it uses dream logic in narrative flow that can be described in terms of the then-popular freudian free association , presenting a series of tenuously related scenes .
