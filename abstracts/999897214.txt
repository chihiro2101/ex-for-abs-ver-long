photomultiplier tubes ( photomultipliers or pmts for short ) , members of the class of vacuum tubes , and more specifically vacuum phototubes , are extremely sensitive detectors of light in the ultraviolet , visible , and near-infrared ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum . these detectors multiply the current produced by incident light by as much as 100 million times or 10 8 ( i.e . , 160 db ) , decibels are power ratios . power is proportional to i 2 ( current squared ) . thus a current gain of 10 8 produces a power gain of 10 16 , or 160 db in multiple dynode stages , enabling ( for example ) individual photons to be detected when the incident flux of light is low . the combination of high gain , low noise , high frequency response or , equivalently , ultra-fast response , and large area of collection has maintained photomultipliers an essential place in spectroscopy , confocal microscopy , raman spectroscopy , fluorescence spectroscopy , nuclear and particle physics , astronomy , medical diagnostics including blood tests , medical imaging , motion picture film scanning ( telecine ) , radar jamming , and high-end image scanners known as drum scanners . elements of photomultiplier technology , when integrated differently , are the basis of night vision devices . research that analyzes light scattering , such as the study of polymers in solution , often uses a laser and a pmt to collect the scattered light data . semiconductor devices , particularly avalanche photodiodes , are alternatives to photomultipliers ; however , photomultipliers are uniquely well-suited for applications requiring low-noise , high-sensitivity detection of light that is imperfectly collimated .
