curry 's paradox is a paradox in which an arbitrary claim f is proved from the mere existence of a sentence c that says of itself '' if c , then f '' , requiring only a few apparently innocuous logical deduction rules . since f is arbitrary , any logic having these rules allows one to prove everything . the paradox may be expressed in natural language and in various logics , including certain forms of set theory , lambda calculus , and combinatory logic . the paradox is named after the logician haskell curry . it has also been called löb 's paradox after martin hugo löb , due to its relationship to löb 's theorem .
