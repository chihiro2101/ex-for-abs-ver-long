trans australia airlines ( taa ) , renamed australian airlines in 1986 , was one of the two major australian domestic airlines between its inception in 1946 and its merger with qantas in september 1992 . as a result of the '' cobra '' ( or common branding ) project , the entire airline was rebranded qantas about a year later with tickets stating in small print '' australian airlines limited trading as qantas airways limited '' until the adoption of a single air operator certificate a few years later . at that point , the entire airline was officially renamed '' qantas airways limited '' continuing the name and livery of the parent company with the only change being the change of by-line from '' the spirit of australia '' to '' the australian airline '' under the window line with the existing '' qantas '' title appearing above . during its period as taa , the company played a major part in the development of the australian domestic air transport industry . the establishment of taa broke the domestic air transport monopoly of australian national airways ( ana ) in the late 1940s , and taking over the queensland air network from qantas . it was also at the time taa supported the flying doctor services of australia by providing aircraft , pilots and engineers to ensure every emergency was answered quickly . qantas had also been instrumental in the formation of the flying doctor service . the airline 's headquarters were located in melbourne .
