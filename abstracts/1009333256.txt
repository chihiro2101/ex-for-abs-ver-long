it plays an essential function for survival , neutralizing gastric acid by allowing urea to enter into periplasm via a proton-gated urea channel . the presence of urease is used in the diagnosis of helicobacter species . all bacterial ureases are solely cytoplasmic , except for those in helicobacter pylori , which along with its cytoplasmic activity , has external activity with host cells . in contrast , all plant ureases are cytoplasmic . fungal and plant ureases are made up of identical subunits ( ~90 kda each ) , most commonly assembled as trimers and hexamers . for example , jack bean urease has two structural and one catalytic subunit . the α subunit contains the active site , it is composed of 840 amino acids per molecule ( 90 cysteines ) , its molecular mass without ni ( ii ) ions amounting to 90.77 kda . the mass of the hexamer with the 12 nickel ions is 545.34 kda . it is structurally related to the ( αβγ ) 3 trimer of bacterial ureases . other examples of homohexameric structures of plant ureases are those of soybean , pigeon pea and cotton seeds enzymes . it is important to note , that although composed of different types of subunits , ureases from different sources extending from bacteria to plants and fungi exhibit high homology of amino acid sequences .
