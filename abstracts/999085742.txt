in computer networking , a wireless access point ( wap ) , or more generally just access point ( ap ) , is a networking hardware device that allows other wi-fi devices to connect to a wired network . as a standalone device , the ap may have a wired connection to a router , but , in a wireless router , it can also be an integral component of the router itself . an ap is differentiated from a hotspot which is a physical location where wi-fi access is available .
