a stratified charge engine describes a certain type of internal combustion engine , usually spark ignition ( si ) engine that can be used in trucks , automobiles , portable and stationary equipment . the term '' stratified charge '' refers to the working fluids and fuel vapors entering the cylinder . usually the fuel is injected into the cylinder or enters as a fuel rich vapor where a spark or other means are used to initiate ignition where the fuel rich zone interacts with the air to promote complete combustion . a stratified charge can allow for slightly higher compression ratios without '' knock , '' and leaner air-fuel ratio than in conventional internal combustion engines . conventionally , a four-stroke ( petrol or gasoline ) otto cycle engine is fueled by drawing a mixture of air and fuel into the combustion chamber during the intake stroke . this produces a homogeneous charge : a homogeneous mixture of air and fuel , which is ignited by a spark plug at a predetermined moment near the top of the compression stroke . in a homogeneous charge system , the air/fuel ratio is kept very close to stoichiometric , meaning it contains the exact amount of air necessary for complete combustion of the fuel . this gives stable combustion , but it places an upper limit on the engine 's efficiency : any attempt to improve fuel economy by running a much leaner mixture ( less fuel or more air ) with a homogeneous charge results in slower combustion and a higher engine temperature ; this impacts on power and emissions , notably increasing nitrogen oxides or nox .
