the radical faeries are a loosely affiliated worldwide network and counterculture movement seeking to redefine queer consciousness through secular spirituality . sometimes deemed a form of modern paganism , the movement also adopts elements from anarchism and environmentalism . rejecting hetero-imitation , the radical faerie movement began during the 1970s sexual revolution among gay men in the united states . the movement has expanded in tandem with the larger gay rights movement , challenging pink capitalism and patriarchal aspects of modern lgbt life while celebrating new age and rituals . faeries tend to be fiercely independent , anti-establishment , and community-focused . the radical faerie movement was founded in california in 1979 by gay activists harry hay and don kilhefner influenced by the legacy of the counterculture of the 1960s , they held the first spiritual conference for radical fairies in arizona in september 1979 . from there , various regional faerie circles were formed , and other large rural gatherings organized . although kilhefner and a later , pivotal member , mitch walker , broke from hay in 1980 , the movement continued to grow , having expanded into an international network soon after the second faerie gathering in 1980 . today radical faeries embody a wide range of genders , sexual orientations , and identities . sanctuaries and gatherings are generally open to all , though several gatherings still focus on the particular spiritual experience of gay co-creating temporary autonomous zones . faerie sanctuaries adapt rural living and environmentally sustainable ways of using modern technologies as part of creative expression . radical faerie communities are sometimes inspired by indigenous , native or two-spirit , especially those that incorporate genderqueer sensibilities . encyclopedia of lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender history in america marc stein , editor ; charles scribner 's sons , 2004 ; , .
