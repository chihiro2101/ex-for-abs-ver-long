a domain name system-based blackhole list , domain name system blacklist ( dnsbl ) or real-time blackhole list ( rbl ) is a service whereby with a simple dns query mail servers can check whether a sending ip address is on a blacklist of ip addresses reputed to send email spam . most mail server software can be configured to check one or more of such lists - typically rejecting or flagging messages if it is from a listed site . a dnsbl is a software mechanism , rather than a specific list or policy . there are dozens of dnsbls in existence , which use a wide array of criteria for the listing and delisting of addresses . these may include listing the addresses of zombie computers or other machines being used to send spam , internet service providers ( isps ) who willingly host spammers , or those which have sent spam to a honeypot system . since the creation of the first dnsbl in 1998 , the operation and policies of these lists have frequently been controversial , both in internet advocacy circles and occasionally in lawsuits . many email systems operators and users consider dnsbls a valuable tool to share information about sources of spam , but others including some prominent internet activists have objected to them as a form of censorship . in addition , a small number of dnsbl operators have been the target of lawsuits filed by spammers seeking to have the lists shut down .
