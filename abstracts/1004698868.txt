300px radio navigation or radionavigation is the application of radio frequencies to geolocalization of an object on the earth , either the vessel or an obstruction . like radiolocation , it is a type of radiodetermination . the basic principles are measurements from/to electric beacons , especially angular directions , e.g . by bearing , radio phases or interferometry , distances , e.g . ranging by measurement of time of flight between one transmitter and multiple receivers or vice versa , distance differences by measurement of multilateration of signals from one transmitter to multiple receivers or vice versa partly also velocity , e.g . by means of radio doppler shift . combinations of these measurement principles also are importantâ€”e.g . , many radars measure range and azimuth of a target .
