the term artistamp ( a portmanteau of the words '' artist '' and '' stamp '' ) or artist 's stamp refers to a postage stamp-like art form used to depict or commemorate any subject its creator chooses . artistamps are a form of cinderella stamps in that they are not valid for postage , but they differ from forgery or bogus illegal stamps in that typically the creator has no intent to defraud post office or stamp collecting . artistamp creators often include their work on legitimate mail , alongside valid postage stamps , in order to decorate the envelope with their art . in many countries this practice is legal , provided the artistamp is not passed off as or likely to be mistaken for a genuine postage stamp . when so combined ( and sometimes , less strictly speaking , even when not so ) the artistamp may be considered part of the mail art genre . irony , satire , humor , eroticism and subversion of governmental authority are frequent characteristics of artistamps . artists may leverage the expectation of official endorsement that necessarily inheres in governmentally-issued postage for the purpose of shocking or subverting viewers ' expectations , with such actions typically representing a specific political and artistic motive . other practitioners are content to depict more homey subjects like kittens and family members . some artists use the form to create fantasy stamps for their own postal system or countries â€“ in many cases thereby developing or complementing an imaginary government .
