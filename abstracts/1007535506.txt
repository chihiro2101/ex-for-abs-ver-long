mystery fiction is a genre fiction that usually involves revealing the identity of a murderer or of the perpetrator of some other type of crime . often within a closed circle of suspects , each suspect is usually provided with a credible motive and a reasonable opportunity for committing the crime . the central character is often a detective ( like sherlock holmes , with his assistant , dr . watson ) , who eventually solves the mystery by logical deduction from facts presented to the reader . some mystery books are non-fiction . mystery fiction can be detective stories in which the emphasis is on the puzzle or suspense element and its logical solution such as a whodunit . mystery fiction can be contrasted with hardboiled detective stories , which focus on action and gritty realism . mystery fiction can involve a supernatural mystery in which the solution does not have to be logical and even in which there is no crime involved . this usage was common in the pulp magazines of the 1930s and 1940s , whose titles such as dime mystery , thrilling mystery and spicy mystery offered what were then described as complicated to solve and weird stories : supernatural horror in the vein of grand guignol . that contrasted with parallel titles of the same names which contained conventional hardboiled crime fiction . the first use of '' mystery '' in that sense was by dime mystery , which started out as an ordinary crime fiction magazine but switched to '' weird menace '' during the later part of 1933 .
