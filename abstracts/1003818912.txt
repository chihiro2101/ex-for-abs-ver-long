written vernacular chinese , also known as baihua , is the forms of written chinese based on the varieties of chinese spoken throughout china , in contrast to classical chinese , the written language used during imperial china up to the early twentieth century . '' the centuries-old three-way opposition between classical written chinese , vernacular written chinese , and vernacular spoken chinese represents an instance of diglossia . '' ( jacob mey , concise encyclopedia of pragmatics , elsevier , 1998:221 . ) a written vernacular based on mandarin chinese was used in novels in the ming and qing dynasties , and later refined by intellectuals associated with the may fourth movement . since the early 1920s , this modern vernacular form has been the standard style of writing for speakers of all varieties of chinese throughout mainland china , taiwan , malaysia and singapore as the written form of modern standard chinese . this is commonly called standard written chinese or modern written chinese to avoid ambiguity with spoken vernaculars , with the written vernaculars of earlier eras , and with other written vernaculars such as written cantonese or written hokkien .
