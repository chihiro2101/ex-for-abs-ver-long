space rock is a genre characterized by loose and lengthy song structures centered on instrumental textures that typically produce a hypnotic , otherworldly sound . it may feature distorted and reverberation-laden guitars , minimal drumming , languid vocals , synthesizers and lyrical themes of outer space and science fiction . the genre emerged in late 1960s psychedelia and progressive rock bands such as pink floyd , hawkwind , and gong who explored a '' cosmic '' sound . later , the style was taken up in the mid-1980s by spacemen 3 , whose '' drone-heavy '' sound was avowedly inspired by and intended to accommodate drug use . by the 1990s , space rock developed into shoegazing and post-rock with bands such as failure , hum , flying saucer attack , and orange goblin .
