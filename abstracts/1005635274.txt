thumb the government of ireland act 1920 ( 10 & 11 geo . 5 c . 67 ) was an act of the parliament of the united kingdom . the act 's long title was '' an act to provide for the better government of ireland '' ; it is also known as the fourth home rule bill or ( inaccurately ) as the fourth home rule act . the act was intended to establish separate home rule institutions within two new subdivisions of ireland : the six north-eastern counties were to form '' northern ireland '' , while the larger part of the country was to form '' southern ireland '' . both areas of ireland were to continue as a part of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland , and provision was made for their future reunification under common home rule institutions . home rule never took effect in southern ireland , due to the irish war of independence , which resulted instead in the anglo-irish treaty and the establishment in 1922 of the irish free state . however , the institutions set up under this act for northern ireland continued to function until they were suspended by the british parliament in 1972 as a consequence of the troubles . the remaining provisions of the act still in force in northern ireland were repealed under the terms of the 1998 good friday agreement .
