thumb a ph meter is a scientific instrument that measures the hydrogen-ion activity in aqueous solution , indicating its acidity or alkalinity expressed as ph . the ph meter measures the difference in electrical potential between a ph electrode and a reference electrode , and so the ph meter is sometimes referred to as a '' potentiometric ph meter '' . the difference in electrical potential relates to the acidity or ph of the solution . oxford dictionary of biochemistry and molecular biology ( 2 ed . ) , ed . richard cammack , teresa atwood , peter campbell , howard parish , anthony smith , frank vella , and john stirling , oxford university press 2006 , the ph meter is used in many applications ranging from experimentation to quality control .
