john wilmot ( 1 april 1647 â€“ 26 july 1680 ) was an english poet and courtier of king charles ii 's restoration court . the restoration reacted against the '' spiritual authoritarianism '' of the puritan era . rochester embodied this new era , and he became as well known for his rakish lifestyle as his poetry , although the two were often interlinked . he died as a result of venereal disease at the age of 33 . rochester was described by his contemporary andrew marvell as '' the best english satirist , '' and he is generally considered to be the most considerable poet and the most learned among the restoration wits . his poetry was widely censored during the victorian era , but enjoyed a revival from the 1920s onwards , with reappraisals from noted literary figures such as graham greene and ezra pound . the critic vivian de sola pinto linked rochester 's libertinism to hobbesian materialism . during his lifetime , rochester was best known for a satyr against reason and mankind , and it remains among his best-known works today .
