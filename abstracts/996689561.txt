minster is an honorific title given to particular churches in england , most notably york minster , westminster abbey in london and southwell minster in nottinghamshire . the term minster is first found in royal foundation charters of the 7th century , when it designated any settlement of clergy living a communal life and endowed by charter with the obligation of maintaining the canonical hours . widespread in 10th-century anglo-saxon england , minsters declined in importance with the systematic introduction of parishes and parish churches from the 11th century onwards . it continued as a title of dignity in later medieval england , for instances where a cathedral , monastery , collegiate church or parish church had originated with an anglo-saxon foundation . eventually a minster came to refer more generally to '' any large or important church , especially a collegiate or cathedral church '' . in the 21st century , the church of england has designated additional minsters by bestowing the status on existing parish churches .
