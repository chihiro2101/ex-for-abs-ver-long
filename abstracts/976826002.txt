in number theory , the ideal class group ( or class group ) of an algebraic number field is the quotient group where is the group of fractional ideals of the ring of integers of , and is its subgroup of principal ideals . the class group is a measure of the extent to which unique factorization fails in the ring of integers of . the order of the group , which is finite , is called the class number of . the theory extends to dedekind domains and their field of fractions , for which the multiplicative properties are intimately tied to the structure of the class group . for example , the class group of a dedekind domain is trivial if and only if the ring is a unique factorization domain .
