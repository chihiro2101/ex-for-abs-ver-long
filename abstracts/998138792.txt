in cryptography , a block cipher mode of operation is an algorithm that uses a block cipher to provide information security such as confidentiality or authenticity . a block cipher by itself is only suitable for the secure cryptographic transformation ( encryption or decryption ) of one fixed-length group of bits called a block . a mode of operation describes how to repeatedly apply a cipher 's single-block operation to securely transform amounts of data larger than a block . most modes require a unique binary sequence , often called an initialization vector ( iv ) , for each encryption operation . the iv has to be non-repeating and , for some modes , random as well . the initialization vector is used to ensure distinct ciphertexts are produced even when the same plaintext is encrypted multiple times independently with the same key . block ciphers may be capable of operating on more than one block size , but during transformation the block size is always fixed . block cipher modes operate on whole blocks and require that the last part of the data be padded to a full block if it is smaller than the current block size . there are , however , modes that do not require padding because they effectively use a block cipher as a stream cipher . historically , encryption modes have been studied extensively in regard to their error propagation properties under various scenarios of data modification . later development regarded integrity protection as an entirely separate cryptographic goal . some modern modes of operation combine confidentiality and authenticity in an efficient way , and are known as authenticated encryption modes .
