the peace of utrecht is a series of peace treaty signed by the belligerents in the war of the spanish succession , in the dutch city of utrecht between april 1713 and february 1715 . the war involved three contenders for the vacant throne of spain , and involved much of europe for over a decade . the main action saw france as the defender of spain against a multinational coalition . the war was very expensive and bloody and finally stalemated . essentially , the treaties allowed philip v ( grandson of king louis xiv of france ) to keep the spanish throne in return for permanently renouncing his claim to the french throne , along with other necessary guarantees that would ensure that france and spain should not merge , thus preserving the balance of power in europe . the treaties between several european states , including spain , great britain , france , portugal , savoy and the dutch republic , helped end the war . the treaties were concluded between the representatives of louis xiv of france and of his grandson philip on one hand , and representatives of anne of great britain , victor amadeus ii of sardinia , john v of portugal and the united provinces of the netherlands on the other . though the king of france ensured the spanish crown for his dynasty , the treaties marked the end of french ambitions of hegemony in europe expressed in the continuous wars of louis xiv , and paved the way to the european system based on the balance of power . r.r . palmer , a history of the modern world 2nd ed . 1961 , p . 234 . british historian g . m . trevelyan argues : another enduring result was the creation of the spanish bourbon dynasty , still reigning over spain up to the present while the original house of bourbon has long since been dethroned in france .
