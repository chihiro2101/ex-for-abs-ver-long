lancelot du lac ( french for lancelot of the lake ) , also written as launcelot and other variants ( such as early german lanzelet , early french lanselos , early welsh lanslod lak , italian lancelotto , spanish lanzarote del lago , and welsh lawnslot y llyn ) , is a character in some versions of arthurian legend , where he is typically depicted as king arthur 's close companion and one of the greatest knights of the round table . in the french-inspired arthurian chivalric romance tradition , lancelot is the orphaned son of king ban of the lost kingdom of benwick , raised in the fairy realm by the lady of the lake . a hero of many battles , quests and tournaments , and famed as a nearly unrivalled swordsman and jouster , lancelot becomes the lord of joyous gard and personal champion of arthur 's wife guinevere . but when his adultery affair with guinevere is discovered , it causes a civil war that is exploited by mordred to end arthur 's kingdom . his first appearance as a main character is found in chr√©tien de troyes ' poem lancelot , the knight of the cart , written in the 12th century . later , his character was expanded upon in other works of arthurian romance , especially the vast lancelot-grail prose cycle that presented the now-familiar version of his legend following its retelling in le morte d'arthur . there , lancelot 's and lady elaine 's son galahad , devoid of his father 's flaws of character , becomes the perfect knight and succeeds in completing the greatest of all quests by retrieving the holy grail after lancelot himself fails due to his sins .
