uss nevada ( bb-36 ) , the second united states navy ship to be named after the nevada , was the lead ship of the two s . launched in 1914 , nevada was a leap forward in dreadnought technology ; four of her new features would be included on almost every subsequent us battleship : triple gun turrets , oil in place of coal for fuel , geared steam turbines for greater range , and the '' all or nothing '' armor principle . these features made nevada , alongside its sister ship , the first us navy '' standard-type '' battleships . nevada served in both world wars . during the last few months of world war i , nevada was based in bantry bay , to protect supply convoys that were sailing to and from great britain . in world war ii , she was one of the battleships trapped when the attack on pearl harbor . nevada was the only battleship to get underway during the attack , making the ship '' the only bright spot in an otherwise dismal and depressing morning '' for the united states . still , the ship was hit by one torpedo and at least six bombs while steaming away from battleship row , forcing the crew to beach the stricken ship on a coral ledge . the ship continued to flood and eventually slid off the ledge and sank to the harbor floor . nevada was subsequently salvaged and modernized at puget sound navy yard , allowing her to serve as a convoy escort in the atlantic and as a fire-support ship in five amphibious assaults ( the invasions of attu , normandy , southern france , iwo jima , and okinawa ) . at the end of world war ii , the navy decided that , due to age , nevada would not be retained as part of the active fleet and she was instead assigned as a target ship for the atomic experiments at bikini atoll in july 1946 ( operation crossroads ) . the ship was hit by the blast from atomic bomb able , and was left heavily damaged and radioactive . unfit for further service , nevada was decommissioned on 29 august 1946 and sunk for naval gunfire practice on 31 july 1948 .
