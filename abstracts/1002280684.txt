catastrophism is the theory that the earth has largely been shaped by sudden , short-lived , violent events , possibly worldwide in scope . this is in contrast to uniformitarianism ( sometimes described as gradualism ) , in which slow incremental changes , such as erosion , created all the earth 's geology features . the proponents of uniformitarianism held that the present was the key to the past , and that all geological processes ( such as erosion ) throughout the past were like those that can be observed now . since the early disputes , a more inclusive and integrated view of geologic events has developed , in which the scientific consensus accepts that there were some catastrophic events in the geologic past , but these were explicable as extreme examples of natural processes which can occur . proponents of catastrophism proposed that the geological epochs had ended with violent and sudden natural catastrophes such as great floods and the rapid orogeny . plants and animals living in the parts of the world where such events occurred were extinction , being replaced abruptly by the new forms whose fossils defined the geological strata . some catastrophists attempted to relate at least one such change to the biblical account of noah 's flood . the concept was first popularised by the early 19th-century french scientist georges cuvier , who proposed that new life forms had moved in from other areas after local floods , and avoided religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings .
