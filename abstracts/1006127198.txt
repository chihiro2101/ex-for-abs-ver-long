suggestibility is the quality of being inclined to accept and act on the suggestions of others . one may fill in gaps in certain memory with false information given by another when recalling a scenario or moment . suggestibility uses cues to distort recollection : when the subject has been persistently told something about a past event , his or her memory of the event conforms to the repeated message . a person experiencing intense emotions tends to be more receptive to ideas and therefore more suggestible . generally , suggestibility decreases as age increases . however , psychologists have found that individual levels of self-esteem and assertiveness can make some people more suggestible than others ; this finding led to the concept of a spectrum of suggestibility .
