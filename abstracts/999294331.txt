deliberative democracy or discursive democracy is a form of democracy in which deliberation is central to decision-making . it adopts elements of both consensus decision-making and majority rule . deliberative democracy differs from traditional democratic theory in that authentic deliberation , not mere vote , is the primary source of legitimacy for the law . while deliberative democracy is generally seen as some form of an amalgam of representative democracy and direct democracy , the actual relationship is usually open to dispute . some practitioners and theorists use the term to encompass representative bodies whose members authentically and practically deliberate on legislation without unequal distributions of power , while others use the term exclusively to refer to decision-making directly by lay citizens , as in direct democracy . the term '' deliberative democracy '' was originally coined by joseph m . bessette in his 1980 work deliberative democracy : the majority principle in republican government .
