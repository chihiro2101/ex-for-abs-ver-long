the fronde the oxford-hachette french dictionary , 4th ed . , 2007 . was a series of civil wars in france between 1648 and 1653 , occurring in the midst of the franco-spanish war , which had begun in 1635 . king louis xiv confronted the combined opposition of the princes , the nobility , the law courts ( parlements ) , as well as most of the french people ; yet he won out in the end . the dispute started when the government of france issued seven fiscal edicts , six of which were to increase taxation . the parlements pushed back and questioned the constitutionality of the king 's actions and sought to check his powers . the fronde was divided into two campaigns , the parlementary fronde and the fronde of the princes . the timing of the outbreak of the parlementary fronde , directly after the peace of westphalia ( 1648 ) that ended the thirty years ' war , was significant . the nuclei of the armed bands that terrorized parts of france under aristocratic leaders during this period had been hardened in a generation of war in germany , where troops still tended to operate autonomously . louis xiv , impressed as a young ruler with the experience of the fronde , came to reorganize french fighting forces under a stricter hierarchy whose leaders ultimately could be made or unmade by the king . jules mazarin blundered into the crisis but came out well ahead at the end . the fronde represented the final attempt of the french nobility to do battle with the king , and they were humiliated . in the long-term , the fronde served to strengthen royal authority , but weakened the economy . the fronde facilitated the emergence of absolute monarchy .
