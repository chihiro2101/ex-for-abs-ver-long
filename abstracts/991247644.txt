a drainage basin is any area of land where precipitation collects and drains off into a common outlet , such as into a river , bay , or other body of water . the drainage basin includes all the surface water from rain runoff , snowmelt , hail , sleet and nearby streams that run downslope towards the shared outlet , as well as the groundwater underneath the earth 's surface . drainage basins connect into other drainage basins at lower elevations in a strahler number , with smaller sub-drainage basins , which in turn drain into another common outlet . other terms for drainage basin are catchment area , catchment basin , drainage area , river basin , water basin , and impluvium . in north america , the term watershed is commonly used to mean a drainage basin , though in other english-speaking countries , it is used only in its original sense , that of a drainage divide . in a closed drainage basin , or endorheic basin , the water converges to a single point inside the basin , known as a sink , which may be a permanent lake , a dry lake , or a point where surface water is losing stream . the drainage basin acts as a funnel by collecting all the water within the area covered by the basin and channelling it to a single point . each drainage basin is separated topographically from adjacent basins by a perimeter , the drainage divide , making up a succession of higher geographical features ( such as a ridge , hill or mountains ) forming a barrier . drainage basins are similar but not identical to hydrologic units , which are drainage areas delineated so as to nest into a multi-level hierarchical drainage system . hydrologic units are defined to allow multiple inlets , outlets , or sinks . in a strict sense , all drainage basins are hydrologic units but not all hydrologic units are drainage basins .
