performed live by the jack hawkins showband , which was the resident band at the oxford galleries night club . hawkins ' name can be seen on the poster outside the club before thorpe runs inside , and the band can faintly be seen on stage as thorpe enters the club . a version of the band 's rendition was available on a live lp by jack hawkins , which was released under two titles , psychedelic '70s and later as everything is beautiful , the pub singer , played by denea wilde , performs a cover of how about you ? by burton lane and ralph freed , a song more associated with glamorous hollywood films than the backrooms of newcastle pubs . the pelaw hussars , a local juvenile jazz band and majorette troupe , also appear and perform two numbers , when the saints go marching in and auld lang syne .
