a queen consort is the wife of a reigning king , or an empress consort in the case of an emperor . a queen consort usually shares her spouse 's social rank and status . she holds the feminine equivalent of the king 's monarchical titles , but historically , she does not share the regnant 's political and military powers . in contrast , a queen regnant is a queen in her own right with all the powers of a monarch , who ( usually ) has become queen by inheriting the throne upon the death of the previous monarch . a well known example of a queen regnant is elizabeth i , daughter of henry viii and anne boleyn . she reigned as queen regnant from 1558 until her death in 1603 .
