spacelab was a reusable laboratory developed by esa and used on certain spaceflights flown by the space shuttle . the laboratory comprised multiple components , including a pressurized module , an unpressurized carrier and other related hardware housed in the shuttle 's cargo bay . the components were arranged in various configurations to meet the needs of each spaceflight . spacelab components flew on a total of about 32 shuttle missions , depending on how such hardware and missions are tabulated . spacelab allowed scientists to perform experiments in microgravity in earth orbit . there was a variety of spacelab-associated hardware , so a distinction can be made between the major spacelab program missions with european scientists running missions in the spacelab habitable module , missions running other spacelab hardware experiments , and other sts missions that used some component of spacelab hardware . there is some variation in counts of spacelab missions , in part because there were different types of spacelab missions with a large range in the amount of spacelab hardware flown and the nature of each mission . there were at least 22 major spacelab missions between 1983 and 1998 , and spacelab hardware was used on a number other missions , with some of the spacelab pallets being flown as late as 2008 .
