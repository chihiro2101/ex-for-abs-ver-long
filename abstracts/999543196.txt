edmund grindal ( c . 15196 july 1583 ) was a prelate of the church of england who , during the reign of elizabeth i , was successively bishop of london , archbishop of york , and archbishop of canterbury . though born far from the centres of political and religious power , he had risen rapidly in the church during the reign of edward vi , culminating in his nomination as bishop of london ; the death of the king prevented his taking up the post , and , along with other marian exiles , grindal sought refuge in continental europe during the reign of mary i . upon elizabeth 's accession , grindal returned and resumed his rise in the church , culminating in his appointment to the highest office . he was a supporter of calvinist puritanism . the late 16th century was a time of great change in the english church , following the elizabethan settlement . although grindal historically was not regarded as a particularly notable church leader , his reputation has been revived by modern critical scholarship , which maintains he had the support of his fellow bishops and set the course for the development of the english church in the early 17th century .
