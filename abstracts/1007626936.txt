the united fruit company , now chiquita brands international , was an american corporation that traded in tropical fruit ( primarily bananas ) grown on latin american plantations and sold in the united states and europe . the company was formed in 1899 , from the merger of minor c . keith 's banana-trading concerns with andrew w . preston 's boston fruit company . it flourished in the early and mid-20th century , and it came to control vast territories and transportation networks in central america , the caribbean coast of colombia and the caribbean . though it competed with the standard fruit company ( later dole food company ) for dominance in the international banana trade , it maintained a virtual monopoly in certain regions , some of which came to be called banana republics , such as costa rica , honduras , and guatemala . united fruit had a deep and long-lasting impact on the economic and political development of several latin american countries . critics often accused it of exploitative neocolonialism , and described it as the archetypal example of the influence of a multinational corporation on the internal politics of the banana republics . after a period of financial decline , united fruit was merged with eli m . black 's amk in 1970 , to become the united brands company . in 1984 , carl lindner , jr . transformed united brands into the present-day chiquita brands international .
