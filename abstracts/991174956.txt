woodstock '94 was an american music festival held in 1994 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the original woodstock festival of 1969 . it was promoted as '' 2 more days of peace and music '' . the poster used to promote the first concert was revised to feature two doves perched on the neck of an electric guitar , instead of the original acoustic one . the 1994 concert was scheduled for the weekend of august 13â€“14 , with a third day ( friday , august 12 ) added later . tickets to the festival cost 135 each . the weather was hot and dry on friday but by early saturday afternoon the storms rolled in . the rains turned much of the field into mud . the event took place on winston farm , just west of saugerties , new york , about north of new york city and northeast of the original 1969 festival site near bethel , which had 12,000 on hand to celebrate the silver anniversary . though only 164,000 tickets were sold , the crowd at woodstock '94 was estimated at 550,000 . ( article archived on woodstock nation web site . ) the size of the crowd was larger than concert organizers had planned for and by the second night many of the event policies were logistically unenforceable . the major issues related to security , when attendees arrived , left or returned to the site , and the official concert food-beverage-vendor policy initially restricting attendees from entering with supplies of food , drinks and above all , alcohol . with the concert site mostly enclosed by simple chain link fences , there was hardly any difficulty for many attendees to enter freely with beer and other banned items . the security staff , along with the entrance and exit staff , could not continue reasonable monitoring of the increasing number of people entering , and exiting , while at the same time maintaining safety , security and a peaceful atmosphere . the festival was followed by woodstock '99 , also in new york at rome .
