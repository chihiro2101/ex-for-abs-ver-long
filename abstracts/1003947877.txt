flight or flying is the process by which an object moves through a space without contacting any planetary surface , either within an atmosphere ( i.e . air flight or aviation ) or through the vacuum of outer space ( i.e . spaceflight ) . this can be achieved by generating lift ( force ) associated with gliding or air propulsion , aerostatically using buoyancy , or by ballistic movement . many things can fly , from flying animals such as birds , bats and insects , to natural gliders/parachuters such as patagium animals , anemochorous seeds and ballistospores , to human inventions like aircraft ( airplanes , helicopters , airships , balloons , etc . ) and rockets which may propel spacecraft and spaceplanes . the engineering aspects of flight are the purview of aerospace engineering which is subdivided into aeronautics , the study of vehicles that travel through the atmosphere , and astronautics , the study of vehicles that travel through space , and ballistics , the study of the flight of projectiles .
