a hydrometer is an instrument used for measuring the relative density of liquids based on the concept of buoyancy . they are typically calibrated and graduated with one or more scales such as specific gravity . a hydrometer usually consists of a sealed hollow glass tube with a wider bottom portion for buoyancy , a ballast such as lead or mercury for stability , and a narrow stem with graduations for measuring . the liquid to test is poured into a tall container , often a graduated cylinder , and the hydrometer is gently lowered into the liquid until it floats freely . the point at which the surface of the liquid touches the stem of the hydrometer correlates to relative density . hydrometers can contain any number of scales along the stem corresponding to properties correlating to the density . hydrometers are calibrated for different uses , such as a lactometer for measuring the density ( creaminess ) of milk , a saccharometer for measuring the density of sugar in a liquid , or an alcoholometer for measuring higher levels of alcohol in spirits . the hydrometer makes use of archimedes ' principle : a solid suspended in a fluid is buoyed by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the submerged part of the suspended solid . the lower the density of the fluid , the deeper a hydrometer of a given weight sinks ; the stem is calibrated to give a numerical reading .
