spelling is a set of conventions that regulate the way of using graphemes to represent a language in its written form . coulmas , f . ( 1996 ) , the blackwell encyclopedia of writing systems , oxford : blackwells in other words , spelling is the rendering of speech sound ( phoneme ) into writing ( grapheme ) . spelling is one of the elements of orthography , and highly standardized spelling is a prescriptive element . spellings originated as transcriptions of the sounds of speech language according to the alphabetic principle . they remain largely reflective of the sounds , although phonemic orthography is an ideal that most languages ' orthographies only approximate , some more closely than others . this is true for various reasons , including that pronunciation changes over time in all languages , yet spellings as visual norms may resist change . in addition , words from other languages may be adopted without being adapted to the spelling system , and different meanings of a word or homophones may be deliberately spelled in different ways to differentiate them visually .
