riddim is the jamaican patois pronunciation of the english word '' rhythm '' . in reggae , dancehall , calypso , soca , grime , and reggaeton parlance it refers to the instrumental accompaniment to a song . these genres consist of the riddim plus the '' voicing '' ( vocal part ) sung by the deejay . the resulting song structure is distinctive in many ways . a given riddim , if popular , may be used in dozens—or even hundreds—of songs , not only in recordings but also in live performances . since the 1970s , riddims have accompanied reggae music and through the 1980s , more widely known as dancehall . as seen in dancehall music , there is a voicing part – sung by the dj – over some riddim that has probably been widely used in many other songs . there is a unique establishment in the combination of riddims and voicing . this redistribution of riddims creates a complexity of diasporic transference through the constant re-versions which could be comparable to hip-hop ’ s use of sampling . the situation is certainly different from u.s . hip-hop as the redistribution of riddims is relative to the jamaican culture that relied heavily on sound systems and studio production . with redistribution , there has been a tricky history with copyright laws in jamaica . since the culture heavily relied on sound systems and vinyl records since the early beginning , there was not a heavy implementation of copyright protections . throughout the 70s and 80s , there still remained no formal copyright system , as the work of producers on various records remained often anonymous . by 1993 , jamaica finally established a copyright act , but producers still face difficulty in establishing profit . through proper registration , many artists now work on negotiating their royalties and taking it more seriously . the unique nature of dancehall and riddims have been highly influential on the numerous remixes that now circulate r & b and hip-hop music .
