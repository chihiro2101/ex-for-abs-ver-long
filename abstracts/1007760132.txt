photonics is the optics of light ( photon ) generation , detection , and manipulation through emission , transmission , modulation , signal processing , switching , amplification , and sensing . though covering all light 's technical applications over the whole spectrum , most photonic applications are in the range of visible and near-infrared light . the term photonics developed as an outgrowth of the first practical semiconductor light emitters invented in the early 1960s and optical fibers developed in the 1970s .
