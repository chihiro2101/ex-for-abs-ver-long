but goldman was on her way to the train station . he told her that he was disappointed in cleveland 's socialists , and goldman quickly introduced him to anarchist friends who were at the train station . she later wrote a piece in defense of czolgosz , which portrays him and his history in a way at odds with other sources : '' who can tell how many times this american child has gloried in the celebration of the 4th of july , or on decoration day , when he faithfully honored the nation â€™ s dead ? who knows but what he , too , was willing to 'fight for his country and die for her liberty ? '' in the weeks that followed , czolgosz 's social awkwardness , evasiveness , and blunt inquiries about secret societies around isaak and another anarchist , emil schilling , resulted in the radical free society newspaper to issue a warning pertaining to him on september 1 , reading : czolgosz believed there was a great injustice in american society , an inequality which allowed the wealthy to enrich themselves by exploiting the poor . he concluded that the reason for this was the structure of government . about this time , he learned of the assassination of a leader in europe ; king umberto i of italy , who had been shot dead by anarchist gaetano bresci on july 29 , 1900 . bresci told the press that he had decided to take matters into his own hands for the sake of the common man . new york city police lieutenant joseph petrosino believed that the same italian-based anarchist group suspected of being responsible for king umberto 's death was targeting president mckinley , but his warnings were ignored .
