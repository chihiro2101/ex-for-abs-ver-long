an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is a compact region at the center of a galaxy that has a much-higher-than-normal luminosity over at least some portion of the electromagnetic spectrum with characteristics indicating that the luminosity is not produced by stars . such excess non-stellar emission has been observed in the radio , microwave , infrared , optical , ultra-violet , x-ray and gamma ray wavebands . a galaxy hosting an agn is called an '' active galaxy '' . the non-stellar radiation from an agn is theorized to result from the accretion of matter by a supermassive black hole at the center of its host galaxy . active galactic nuclei are the most luminous persistent sources of electromagnetic radiation in the universe , and as such can be used as a means of discovering distant objects ; their evolution as a function of cosmic time also puts constraints on cosmology . the observed characteristics of an agn depend on several properties such as the mass of the central black hole , the rate of gas accretion onto the black hole , the orientation of the accretion disk , the degree of obscuration of the nucleus by dust , and presence or absence of jets . numerous subclasses of agn have been defined based on their observed characteristics ; the most powerful agn are classified as quasars . a blazar is an agn with a jet pointed toward the earth , in which radiation from the jet is enhanced by relativistic beaming .
