planetshine is the dim illumination , by sunlight reflected from a planet , of all or part of the otherwise dark side of any moon orbiting the body . planetlight is the diffuse reflection of sunlight from a planet , whose albedo can be measured . the most observed and familiar example of planetshine is earthshine on the moon , which is most visible from the night side of earth when the lunar phase is crescent or nearly new , without the atmospheric brightness of the daytime sky . typically , this results in the dark side of the moon being bathed in a faint light . planetshine has also been observed elsewhere in the solar system . in particular , the cassiniâ€“huygens used saturn 's shine to image portions of the planet 's moons , even when they do not reflect direct sunlight .
