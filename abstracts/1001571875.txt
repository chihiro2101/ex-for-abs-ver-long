chinese astrology is based on the traditional astronomy and calendars . chinese astrology came to flourish during the han dynasty ( 2nd century bc to 2nd century ad ) . chinese astrology has a close relation with chinese philosophy ( theory of the three harmonies : heaven , earth , and water ) , and uses the principles of yin and yang and concepts that are not found in western astrology , such as the wuxing ( five phases ) , the ten heavenly stems , the twelve earthly branches , the chinese calendar ( moon calendar and sun calendar ) , and the time calculation after year , month , day , and shichen , double hour ) .
