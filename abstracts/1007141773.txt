at the end of july 1931 the may committee , appointed in february to investigate government spending , taylor , p . 361 prescribed heavy cuts , including a massive reduction in unemployment benefit . taylor , pp . 362–63 during august , in an atmosphere of financial panic and a run on the pound , the government debated the report . macdonald and snowden were prepared to implement it , but lansbury and nine other cabinet ministers rejected the cut in unemployment benefit . thus divided , the government could not continue ; macdonald , however , did not resign as prime minister . after discussions with the opposition leaders and the king he formed a national all-party coalition , with a '' doctor 's mandate '' to tackle the economic crisis . the great majority of labour mps , including lansbury , were opposed to this action ; macdonald and the few who followed him were expelled from the party , and arthur henderson became leader . taylor , pp . 366–67 macdonald 's move was broadly welcomed in the country , however , and in the 1931 united kingdom general election the national government was returned with an enormous majority . labour was reduced to 46 members ; lansbury was the only senior member of the labour leadership to retain his seat .
