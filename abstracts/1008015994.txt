an interest rate is the amount of interest due per period , as a proportion of the amount lent , deposited or borrowed ( called the principal sum ) . the total interest on an amount lent or borrowed depends on the principal sum , the interest rate , the compounding frequency , and the length of time over which it is lent , deposited or borrowed . it is defined as the proportion of an amount loaned which a lender charges as interest to the borrower , normally expressed as an annual percentage . it is the rate a bank or other lender charges to borrow its money , or the rate a bank pays its savers for keeping money in an account . the annual interest rate is the rate over a period of one year . other interest rates apply over different periods , such as a month or a day , but they are usually annualised .
