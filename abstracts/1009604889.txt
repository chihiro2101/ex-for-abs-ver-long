asafoetida ; also spelled asafetida ) is the dried latex ( gum oleoresin ) exuded from the rhizome or tap root of several species of ferula ( f . foetida and f . assa-foetida ) , perennial herbs growing tall . they are part of the celery family , apiaceae . asafoetida is thought to be in the same genus as silphium , a north african plant now believed to be extinct , and was used as a cheaper substitute for that historically important herb from classical antiquity . the species are native to the deserts of iran and mountains of afghanistan where substantial amounts are grown . the common modern name for the plant in iran and afghanistan is ( in persian ) , meaning 'that of gas or wind ' , due to its use to relieve flatulence . asafoetida has a pungency , lending it the trivial name of '' stinking gum '' . the odor dissipates upon cooking ; in cooked dishes , it delivers a smooth flavour reminiscent of leeks or other onion relatives . asafoetida is also known colloquially as '' devil 's dung '' or '' food of the devils '' in english ( and similar expressions in many other languages ) .
