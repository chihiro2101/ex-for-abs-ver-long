pentium 4 processors have an integrated heat spreader ( ihs ) that prevents the die from accidentally being damaged when mounting and unmounting cooling solutions . prior to the ihs , a cpu shim was sometimes used by people worried about damaging the core . overclockers sometimes removed the ihs from socket 423 and socket 478 chips to allow for more direct heat transfer . on socket 478 prescott processors and processors using the socket lga 775 ( socket t ) interface , the ihs is directly soldered to the die or dies , making it difficult to remove .
