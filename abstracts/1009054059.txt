ehlersâ€“danlos syndromes are a group of rare genetic connective tissue disease . symptoms may include loose joints , joint pain , stretchy velvety skin , and abnormal scar formation . these can be noticed at birth or in early childhood . complications may include aortic dissection , joint dislocations , scoliosis , chronic pain , or early osteoarthritis . eds occurs due to variations of more than 19 different genes that are present at birth . the specific gene affected determines the type of eds . some cases result from a new variation occurring during early development , while others are inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive manner . typically , these variations result in defects in the structure or processing of the protein collagen . diagnosis is often based on symptoms and confirmed with genetic testing or skin biopsy , but people may initially be misdiagnosed with hypochondriasis , depression , or chronic fatigue syndrome . a large number of signs and symptoms still remain to be identified and linked to eds , and ignorance on the part of physicians is , according to rehabilitation medicine physician claude hamonet , '' at the origin of therapeutic errors accompanied by the iatrogenic effects of prejudice towards these patients . '' no cure is known . treatment is supportive in nature . physical therapy and bracing may help strengthen muscles and support joints . while some forms of eds result in a normal life expectancy , those that affect blood vessels generally decrease it . the hypermobile type of eds ( heds ) affects at least one in 5,000 people globally ; other types occur at lower frequencies . the prognosis depends on the specific disorder . excess mobility was first described by hippocrates in 400 bc . the syndromes are named after two physicians , edvard ehlers from denmark and henri-alexandre danlos from france , who described them at the turn of the 20th century .
