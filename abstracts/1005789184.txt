engine sales increased , mostly for use in boats , and in june 1887 , daimler bought another property at seelberg hill , cannstatt . it was located some distance from the town on ludwigstra√üe 67 because cannstatt 's mayor did not approve of the workshop . built at a cost 30,200 goldmarks , the new premises had room for 23 employees . daimler managed the commercial issues while maybach ran the engine design department . in 1889 , daimler and maybach built the stahlradwagen , their first automobile that did not involve adapting a horse-drawn carriage with their engine , but which was somewhat influenced by bicycle designs . there was no production in germany , but it was licensed to be built in france and presented to the public in paris in october 1889 by both engineers . the same year , daimler 's wife , emma kunz , died .
