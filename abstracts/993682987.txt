computability theory , also known as recursion theory , is a branch of mathematical logic , computer science , and the theory of computation that originated in the 1930s with the study of computable functions and turing degrees . the field has since expanded to include the study of generalized computability and definability . in these areas , recursion theory overlaps with proof theory and effective descriptive set theory . basic questions addressed by recursion theory include : what does it mean for a function on the natural numbers to be computable ? how can noncomputable functions be classified into a hierarchy based on their level of noncomputability ? although there is considerable overlap in terms of knowledge and methods , mathematical recursion theorists study the theory of relative computability , reducibility notions , and degree structures ; those in the computer science field focus on the theory of subrecursive hierarchies , formal methods , and formal languages .
