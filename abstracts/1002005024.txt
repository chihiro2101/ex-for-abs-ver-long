albrecht ritschl ( 25 march 182220 march 1889 ) was a german protestant theology . starting in 1852 , ritschl lectured on '' systematic theology '' . according to this system , faith was understood to be irreducible to other experiences , beyond the scope of reason . faith , he said , came not from facts but from value judgments . jesus ' divinity , he argued , was best understood as expressing '' revelational-value '' of christ for the community that trusts him as god . he held the christ 's message to be committed to a community .
