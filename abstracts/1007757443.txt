in a parliamentary or semi-presidential system of government , a reserve power is a power that may be exercised by the head of state without the approval of another branch of the government . unlike in a presidential system of government , the head of state is generally constrained by the cabinet or the legislature in a parliamentary system , and most reserve powers are usable only in certain exceptional circumstances . in some countries , reserve powers go by another name ; for instance , the president of ireland discretionary powers are called discretionary powers .
