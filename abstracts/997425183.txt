in physics , there are four observed fundamental interactions ( informally , '' fundamental forces '' ) that form the basis of all known interactions in nature : gravity , electromagnetic , strong nuclear , and weak nuclear forces . some speculative theories have proposed a fifth force to explain various anomalous observations that do not fit existing theories . the characteristics of this fifth force depend on the hypothesis being advanced . many postulate a force roughly the strength of gravity ( i.e . , it is much weaker than electromagnetism or the nuclear forces ) with a range of anywhere from less than a millimeter to cosmological scales . another proposal is a new weak force mediated by w′ and z′ bosons . the search for a fifth force has increased in recent decades due to two discoveries in cosmology which are not explained by current theories . it has been discovered that most of the mass of the universe is accounted for by an unknown form of matter called dark matter . most physicists believe that dark matter consists of new , undiscovered subatomic particles , but some believe that it could be related to an unknown fundamental force . second , it has also recently been discovered that the expansion of the universe is accelerating , which has been attributed to a form of energy called dark energy . some physicists speculate that a form of dark energy called quintessence could be a fifth force .
