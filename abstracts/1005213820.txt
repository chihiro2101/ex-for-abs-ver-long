differential heat treatment ( also called selective heat treatment or local heat treatment ) is a technique used during heat treating to harden or soften certain areas of a steel object , creating a difference in hardness between these areas . there are many techniques for creating a difference in properties , but most can be defined as either differential hardening or differential tempering . these were common heat treating techniques used historically in europe and asia , with possibly the most widely known example being from japanese swordsmithing . some modern varieties were developed in the twentieth century as metallurgical knowledge and technology rapidly increased . differential hardening consists of either two methods . it can involve heating the metal evenly to a red-hot temperature and then cooling it at different rates , turning part of the object into very hard martensite while the rest cools slower and becomes softer pearlite . it may also consist of heating only a part of the object very quickly to red-hot and then rapidly cooling ( quenching ) , turning only part of it into hard martensite but leaving the rest unchanged . conversely , differential tempering methods consist of heating the object evenly to red-hot and then quenching the entire object , turning the whole thing into martensite . the object is then heated to a much lower temperature to soften it ( tempering ) , but is only heated in a localized area , softening only a part of it .
