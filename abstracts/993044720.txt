a lime kiln is a kiln used for the calcination of limestone ( calcium carbonate ) to produce the form of lime called quicklime ( calcium oxide ) . the chemical equation for this reaction is : caco 3 + heat → cao + carbon dioxide this reaction takes place at ( at which temperature the partial pressure of co 2 is 1 atmosphere ) , but a temperature around 1000 & nbsp ; °c ( 1800 & nbsp ; °f ; at which temperature the partial pressure of co 2 is 3.8 atmospheres crc handbook of chemistry and physics , 54th ed , p f-76 ) is usually used to make the reaction proceed quickly . parkes , g.d . and mellor , j.w .
