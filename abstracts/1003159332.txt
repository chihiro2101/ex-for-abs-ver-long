the bridgwater and taunton canal is a canal in the south-west of england between bridgwater and taunton , opened in 1827 and linking the river tone to the river parrett . there were a number of abortive schemes to link the bristol channel to the english channel by waterway in the 18th and early 19th centuries . these schemes followed the approximate route eventually taken by the bridgwater and taunton canal , but the canal was instead built as part of a plan to link bristol to taunton by waterway . the early years of operation were marred by a series of legal disputes , which were resolved when the bridgwater and taunton canal company and the conservators , who managed the river tone navigation , agreed that the canal company should take over the tone navigation . the canal originally terminated at a basin at huntworth , to the east of bridgwater , but was later extended to a floating harbour at bridgwater docks on its western edge . financially this was a disaster , as the extension was funded by a mortgage , and the arrival of the railways soon afterwards started the demise of the canal . the canal was rescued from bankruptcy by the bristol and exeter railway in 1866 . despite commercial traffic ceasing in 1907 , the infrastructure was maintained in good order , and the canal was used for the transport of potable water from 1962 . the countryside act 1968 provided a framework for somerset county council to start the restoration of the canal as a leisure facility , which was completed in 1994 , when the canal was reopened throughout . bridgwater docks have been restored as a marina , but there is no navigable connection to the river parrett , as the canal still transports drinking water for the people of bridgwater .
