a digital signal processor ( dsp ) is a specialized microprocessor chip , with its architecture optimized for the operational needs of digital signal processing . dsps are fabricated on mos integrated circuit chips . they are widely used in audio signal processing , telecommunications , digital image processing , radar , sonar and speech recognition systems , and in common consumer electronic devices such as mobile phones , disk drives and high-definition television ( hdtv ) products . the goal of a dsp is usually to measure , filter or compress continuous real-world analog signals . most general-purpose microprocessors can also execute digital signal processing algorithms successfully , but may not be able to keep up with such processing continuously in real-time . also , dedicated dsps usually have better power efficiency , thus they are more suitable in portable devices such as mobile phones because of power consumption constraints . dsps often use special memory architectures that are able to fetch multiple data or instructions at the same time . dsps often also implement data compression technology , with the discrete cosine transform ( dct ) in particular being a widely used compression technology in dsps .
