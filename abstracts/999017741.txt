triggerfish are about 40 species of often brightly colored fish of the family balistidae . often marked by lines and spots , they inhabit tropics and subtropics oceans throughout the world , with the greatest species richness in the indo-pacific . most are found in relatively shallow , coastal habitats , especially at coral reefs , but a few , such as the oceanic triggerfish ( canthidermis maculata ) , are pelagic . while several species from this family are popular in the marine aquarium trade , they are often notoriously ill-tempered .
