mordred or modred ; welsh : medraut or medrawt ) is a character who is variously portrayed in the arthurian legend . the earliest known mention of a possibly historical medraut is in the welsh chronicle annales cambriae , wherein he and arthur are ambiguously associated with the battle of camlann in a brief entry for the year 537 . his figure seemed to have been regarded positively in the early welsh tradition and may have been related to that of arthur 's son . as modredus , mordred was depicted as arthur 's traitorous nephew and a legitimate son of king lot in geoffrey of monmouth 's pseudo-historical work historia regum britanniae which then served as the basis for the following evolution of the legend since the 12th century . later variants most often characterised him as arthur 's villainous bastard son , born of an incestuous relationship with morgause named either anna , orcades or morgause . the accounts presented in the historia and most other versions include mordred 's death at camlann , typically in a final duel during which he manages to mortally wound his slayer arthur . mordred is usually a brother or half-brother to gawain ; however , his other family relations as well as his relationships with arthur 's wife guinevere vary greatly . in a popular telling originating from the french chivalric romances of the 13th century , and made prominent today through its inclusion in le morte d'arthur , mordred is knighted by arthur and joins the fellowship of the round table . in this narrative , he eventually becomes the main actor in arthur 's downfall as he helps his half-brother agravain to expose guinevere 's and lancelot 's affair and then takes advantage of the resulting war to make himself the high king of britain .
