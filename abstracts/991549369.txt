ernesto júlio de nazareth ( march 20 , 1863 – february 1 , 1934 ) was a brazilian composer and pianist , especially noted for his creative maxixe and choro compositions . influenced by a diverse set of rhythms like the polka , the habanera , and the lundu , he combined this elements with his classical formation to create compositions that he called “ brazilian tangos '' . these would be the precursors for what is known today as choro . his piano repertoire is now part of the teaching programs of both classical and popular styles , as nazareth once served at the boundary between these two worlds .
