earl of derby is a title in the peerage of england . the title was first adopted by robert de ferrers , 1st earl of derby , under a creation of 1139 . it continued with the ferrers family until the 6th earl forfeited his property toward the end of the reign of henry iii and died in 1279 . most of the ferrers property and ( by a creation in 1337 ) the derby title were then held by the family of henry iii . the title merged in the crown upon henry iv 's accession to the throne in 1399 . the title was created again , this time for the stanley family , in 1485 . lord derby 's subsidiary titles are baron stanley of bickerstaffe in the county palatine of lancaster ( created 1832 ) , and baron stanley of preston in the county palatine of lancaster ( 1886 ) . the courtesy title of the heir apparent is lord stanley . the 1st to 5th earls also held an earlier baron stanley , created for the 1st earl 's father in 1456 and currently abeyant ; the 2nd to 5th earls held the baron strange created in 1299 , currently held by the viscount st davids ; and the 7th to 9th earls held another barony of strange , created in error in 1628 and currently held independently of other peerages . several successive generations of the stanley earls , along with other members of the family , have been prominent members of the conservative party , and at least one historian has suggested that this family rivals the marquess of salisbury as the single most important family in the party 's history . they were at times one of the richest landowning families in england . the stanley cup , the championship trophy of the national hockey league , was presented to the dominion of canada in 1892 by frederick stanley , 16th earl of derby , during his tenure as governor general of canada . the family seat is knowsley hall , near liverpool , merseyside .
