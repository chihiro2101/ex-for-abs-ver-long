bubble memory is a type of non-volatile computer memory that uses a thin film of a magnetic material to hold small magnetized areas , known as bubbles or domains , each storing one bit of data . the material is arranged to form a series of parallel tracks that the bubbles can move along under the action of an external magnetic field . the bubbles are read by moving them to the edge of the material where they can be read by a conventional magnetic pickup , and then rewritten on the far edge to keep the memory cycling through the material . in operation , bubble memories are similar to delay line memory systems . bubble memory started out as a promising technology in the 1980s , offering memory density of an order similar to hard drives but performance more comparable to core memory while lacking any moving parts . this led many to consider it a contender for a '' universal memory '' that could be used for all storage needs . the introduction of dramatically faster semiconductor memory chips pushed bubble into the slow end of the scale , and equally dramatic improvements in hard drive capacity made it uncompetitive in price terms . bubble memory was used for some time in the 1970s and 80s where its non-moving nature was desirable for maintenance or shock-proofing reasons . the introduction of flash ram and similar technologies rendered even this niche uncompetitive , and bubble disappeared entirely by the late 1980s .
