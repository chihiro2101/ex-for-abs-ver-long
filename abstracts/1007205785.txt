triglycerides can be saponified with sodium hydroxide to give glycerol and fatty sodium salt or soap . typical plant sources include soybeans or palm . animal-derived tallow is another source . approximately 950,000 tons per year are produced in the united states and europe ; 350,000 tons of glycerol were produced per year in the united states alone from 2000 to 2004 . the eu directive 2003/30/ec set a requirement that 5.75 % of petroleum fuels are to be replaced with biofuel sources across all member states by 2010 . it was projected in 2006 that by the year 2020 , production would be six times more than demand , creating an excess of glycerol . glycerol from triglycerides is produced on a large scale , but the crude product is of variable quality , with a low selling price of as low as 2-5 u.s . cents per kilogram in 2011 . it can be purified , but the process is expensive . some glycerol is burned for energy , but its heat value is low . crude glycerol from the hydrolysis of triglycerides can be purified by treatment with activated carbon to remove organic impurities , alkali to remove unreacted glycerol esters , and ion exchange to remove salts . high purity glycerol ( > 99.5 % ) is obtained by multi-step distillation ; a vacuum chamber is necessary due to its high boiling point ( 290 & nbsp ; Â°c ) .
