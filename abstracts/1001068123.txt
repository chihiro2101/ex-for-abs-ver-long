in economics , moral hazard occurs when an entity has an incentive to increase its exposure to risk because it does not bear the full costs of that risk . for example , when a corporation is insured , it may take on higher risk knowing that its insurance will pay the associated costs . a moral hazard may occur where the actions of the risk-taking party change to the detriment of the cost-bearing party after a financial transaction has taken place . moral hazard can occur under a type of information asymmetry where the risk-taking party to a transaction knows more about its intentions than the party paying the consequences of the risk and has a tendency or incentive to take on too much risk from the perspective of the party with less information . one example is a principal-agent problem , where one party , called an agent , acts on behalf of another party , called the principal . if the agent has more information about his or her actions or intentions than the principal then the agent may have an incentive to act too riskily ( from the viewpoint of the principal ) if the interests of the agent and the principal are not aligned .
