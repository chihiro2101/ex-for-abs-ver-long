rocksteady is a music genre that originated in jamaica around 1966 . a successor of ska and a precursor to reggae , rocksteady was the dominant style of music in jamaica for nearly two years , performed by many of the artists who helped establish reggae , including harmony groups such as the techniques , the paragons , the heptones and the gaylads ; soulful singers such as alton ellis , delroy wilson , bob andy , ken boothe and phyllis dillon ; musicians such as jackie mittoo , lynn taitt and tommy mccook . the term rocksteady comes from a popular ( slower ) dance style mentioned in the alton ellis song 'rocksteady ' that matched the new sound . some rocksteady songs became hits outside jamaica , as with ska , helping to secure the international base reggae music has today . despite the name , rocksteady is not directly related to rock .
