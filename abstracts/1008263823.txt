ventricular fibrillation ( v-fib or vf ) is an abnormal heart rhythm in which the ventricles of the heart quiver instead of pumping normally . it is due to disorganized electrical activity . ventricular fibrillation results in cardiac arrest with loss of consciousness and no pulse . this is followed by death in the absence of treatment . ventricular fibrillation is initially found in about 10 % of people with cardiac arrest . ventricular fibrillation can occur due to coronary heart disease , valvular heart disease , cardiomyopathy , brugada syndrome , long qt syndrome , electric shock , or intracranial hemorrhage . diagnosis is by an electrocardiogram ( ecg ) showing irregular unformed qrs complexes without any clear p waves . an important differential diagnosis is torsades de pointes . treatment is with cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) and defibrillation . biphasic defibrillation may be better than monophasic . the medication epinephrine or amiodarone may be given if initial treatments are not effective . rates of survival among those who are out of hospital when the arrhythmia is detected is about 17 % while in hospital it is about 46 % .
