in geography and geology , a cliff is a vertical , or nearly vertical , rock exposure . cliffs are formed as erosion landforms by the processes of weathering and erosion . cliffs are common on coasts , in mountainous areas , escarpments and along rivers . cliffs are usually formed by rock that is resistant to weathering and erosion . sedimentary rocks most likely to form cliffs include sandstone , limestone , chalk , and dolomite . igneous rocks such as granite and basalt also often form cliffs . an escarpment ( or scarp ) is a type of cliff , formed by the movement of a geologic fault or landslide , or by differential erosion of rock layers of differing hardness . most cliffs have some form of scree slope at their base . in arid areas or under high cliffs , they are generally exposed jumbles of fallen rock . in areas of higher moisture , a soil slope may obscure the talus . many cliffs also feature tributary waterfalls or rock shelters . sometimes a cliff peters out at the end of a ridge , with mushroom rocks or other types of rock columns remaining . coastal erosion may lead to the formation of sea cliffs along a receding coastline . the ordnance survey distinguishes between cliffs ( continuous line along the top edge with projections down the face ) and outcrops ( continuous lines along lower edge ) .
