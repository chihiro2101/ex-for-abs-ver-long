image : overclock.jpg thumb upright 1.5 overclocking bios setup on an abit nf7-s motherboard with an amd athlon & nbsp ; xp processor . front side bus ( fsb ) frequency ( external clock ) has been increased from 133 & nbsp ; mhz to 148 & nbsp ; mhz , and the cpu clock multiplier factor has been changed from 13.5 to 16.5 . this corresponds to an overclocking of the fsb by 11.3 % and of the cpu by 36 % . in computing , overclocking is the practice of increasing the clock rate of a computer to exceed that certified by the manufacturer . commonly , operating voltage is also increased to maintain a component 's operational stability at accelerated speeds . semiconductor devices operated at higher frequencies and voltages increase power consumption and heat . an overclocked device may be unreliable or fail completely if the additional heat load is not removed or power delivery components can not meet increased power demands . many device warranties state that overclocking and/or over-specification voids any warranty , however there are an increasing number of manufacturers that will allow overclocking as long as performed ( relatively ) safely .
