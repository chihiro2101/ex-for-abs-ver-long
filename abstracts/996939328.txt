thumb team roping also known as heading and heeling is a rodeo event that features a steer ( typically a corriente ) and two equestrianism . the first roper is referred to as the '' header '' , the person who ropes the front of the steer , usually around the horns , but it is also legal for the rope to go around the neck , or go around one horn and the nose resulting in what they call a '' half head '' . once the steer is caught by one of the three legal head catches , the header must dally ( wrap the rope around the rubber covered saddle horn ) and use his horse to turn the steer to the left . the second roper is the '' heeler '' , who ropes the steer by its hind feet after the '' header '' has turned the steer , with a five-second penalty assessed to the end time if only one leg is caught . team roping is the only rodeo event where men and women compete equally together in professionally sanctioned competition , in both single-gender or mixed-gender teams .
