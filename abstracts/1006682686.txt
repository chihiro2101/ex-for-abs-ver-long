neverland is a fictional island featured in the works of j . m . barrie and those based on them . it is an imaginary faraway place where peter pan , tinker bell , captain hook , the lost boys , and some other mythical beings and creatures live . although not all people who come to neverland cease to age , its best-known resident famously refused to grow up . thus , the term is often used as a metaphor for eternal childhood ( and childishness ) , as well as immortality and escapism . the concept was first introduced as '' the never never land '' in barrie 's theatre play peter pan , or the boy who would n't grow up , first staged in 1904 . in the earliest drafts of the play , the island was called '' peter 's never never never land , '' , a name possibly influenced by the 'never never ' , a contemporary term for outback australia . in the 1928 published version of the play 's script , the name was shortened to '' the never land '' . although the caption to one of f . d . bedford 's illustrations also calls it '' the never never land , '' barrie 's 1911 novelisation peter and wendy simply refers to it as '' the neverland , '' and its many variations '' the neverlands . '' neverland has been featured prominently in subsequent works that either adapted barrie 's works or expanded upon them . these neverlands sometimes vary in nature from the original .
