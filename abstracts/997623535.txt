protein production is the biotechnology process of generating a specific protein . it is typically achieved by the manipulation of gene expression in an organism such that it expresses large amounts of a recombinant gene . this includes the transcription of the recombinant dna to messenger rna ( mrna ) , the translation of mrna into polypeptide chains , which are ultimately folded into functional proteins and may be targeted to specific subcellular or extracellular locations . protein production systems ( in lab jargon also referred to as 'expression systems ' ) are used in the life sciences , biotechnology , and medicine . molecular biology research uses numerous proteins and enzymes , many of which are from expression systems ; particularly dna polymerase for pcr , reverse transcriptase for rna analysis , restriction endonucleases for cloning , and to make proteins that are screened in drug discovery as biological targets or as potential drugs themselves . there are also significant applications for expression systems in industrial fermentation , notably the production of biopharmaceuticals such as human insulin to treat diabetes , and to manufacture enzymes .
