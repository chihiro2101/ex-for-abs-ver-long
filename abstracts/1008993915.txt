the battle of montmirail ( 11 february 1814 ) was fought between a french force led by emperor napoleon and two allied corps commanded by fabian wilhelm von osten-sacken and ludwig yorck von wartenburg . in hard fighting that lasted until evening , french troops including the imperial guard defeated sacken 's russian soldiers and compelled them to retreat to the north . part of yorck 's prussian i corps tried to intervene in the struggle but it was also driven off . the battle occurred near montmirail , france during the six days campaign of the napoleonic wars . montmirail is located east of meaux . after napoleon crushed zakhar dmitrievich olsufiev 's small isolated corps in the battle of champaubert on 10 february , he found himself in the midst of gebhard leberecht von bl체cher 's widely-spread army of silesia . leaving a small force in the east to watch bl체cher , napoleon turned the bulk of his army to the west in an attempt to destroy sacken . unaware of the size of napoleon 's army , sacken tried to smash his way east to join bl체cher . the russians managed to hold their ground for several hours , but were forced back as more and more french soldiers appeared on the battlefield . yorck 's troops belatedly arrived only to be repulsed , but the prussians distracted the french long enough to allow sacken 's russians to join them in a withdrawal to the north . the following day would see the battle of ch창teau-thierry as napoleon launched an all-out pursuit .
