facel s.a . was a french manufacturer of pressed steel automobile components , later complete automobiles of their own design . to intensify its war effort , french subcontracting company for military aeronautics bronzavia created a subsidiary called facel ( acronym of forges et ateliers de constructions d'eure-et-loir ) in december 1939 . after the war , in 1945 , by merging with métallon , facel began to make short-run special bodies , coupés or cabriolets for simca , ford , panhard and delahaye . approximately 2,900 cars of all models were hand-built in facel 's short life . unitary bodies without a chassis became general for mass-produced cars , and facel lost its big customers . french niche manufacturers ceased production . métallon left the partnership in 1953 , and facel set about designing and making its own complete cars using engines made by chrysler , volvo and austin . its first design , named vega , was shown to the public in 1954 . the facellia model , introduced in 1959 , was under-developed , and losses brought about by its warranty problems became impossible to recoup . prior to closure facel had been placed under the control of sud aviation subsidiary sferma . though initially successful , facel closed its factory in october 1964 .
