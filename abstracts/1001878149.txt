pedogenesis ( from the greek pedo- , or pedon , meaning 'soil , earth , ' and genesis , meaning 'origin , birth ' ) ( also termed soil development , soil evolution , soil formation , and soil genesis ) is the process of soil formation as regulated by the effects of place , environment , and history . biogeochemical processes act to both create and destroy order ( anisotropy ) within soils . these alterations lead to the development of layers , termed soil horizons , distinguished by differences in color , structure , texture , and chemistry . these features occur in patterns of soil type distribution , forming in response to differences in soil forming factors . pedogenesis is studied as a branch of pedology , the study of soil in its natural environment . other branches of pedology are the study of soil morphology , and soil classification . the study of pedogenesis is important to understanding soil distribution patterns in current ( soil mapping ) and past ( paleopedology ) geologic periods .
