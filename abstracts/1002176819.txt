the parasympathetic nervous system ( psns ) is one of the three divisions of the autonomic nervous system , the others being the sympathetic nervous system and the enteric nervous system . the autonomic nervous system is responsible for regulating the body 's unconscious actions . the parasympathetic system is responsible for stimulation of '' rest-and-digest '' or '' feed and breed '' activities that occur when the body is at rest , especially after eating , including sexual arousal , salivation , tears ( tears ) , urination , digestion , and defecation . its action is described as being complementary to that of the sympathetic nervous system , which is responsible for stimulating activities associated with the fight-or-flight response . nerve fibres of the parasympathetic nervous system arise from the central nervous system . specific nerves include several cranial nerves , specifically the oculomotor nerve , facial nerve , glossopharyngeal nerve , and vagus nerve . three spinal nerves in the sacrum ( s2-4 ) , commonly referred to as the pelvic splanchnic nerves , also act as parasympathetic nerves . owing to its location , the parasympathetic system is commonly referred to as having '' craniosacral outflow '' , which stands in contrast to the sympathetic nervous system , which is said to have '' thoracolumbar outflow '' .
