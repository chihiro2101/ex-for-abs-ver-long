lanolin ( from latin 'wool ' , and 'oil ' ) , also called wool yolk , wool wax , or wool grease , is a wax secreted by the sebaceous glands of wool-bearing animals . lanolin used by humans comes from domestic sheep breeds that are raised specifically for their wool . historically , many pharmacopoeias have referred to lanolin as wool fat ( adeps lanae ) ; however , as lanolin lacks glycerides ( glycerol esters ) , it is not a true fat . lanolin primarily consists of sterol esters instead . lanolin 's waterproofing property aids sheep in shedding water from their coats . certain breeds of sheep produce large amounts of lanolin . lanolin 's role in nature is to protect wool and skin from climate and the environment ; it also plays a role in skin ( integumental ) hygiene . lanolin and its derivatives are used in the protection , treatment and beautification of human skin .
