the stratford-upon-avon and midland junction railway ( smjr ) was a railway company formed at the beginning of 1909 by the merger of three earlier companies : the east and west junction railway , the evesham , redditch , and stratford-upon-avon junction railway , and the stratford-upon-avon , towcester , and midland junction railway . in 1910 the northampton and banbury junction railway was purchased and an east-west network was formed which linked routes to bedford and northampton in the east to lines leading towards banbury and gloucester in the west , by way of towcester and stratford-on-avon . the constituent lines had each been built with a view to carrying northamptonshire iron ore to south wales and the west midlands , but they were all unable to finance their planned lines in full . the formation of the smjr in 1909 was in effect a financial reconstruction , but the management of the combined company also showed a certain flair for generating tourist income , based on the connection with shakespeare and also the family connections with george washington . in addition the line developed as a shorter route for midland railway goods traffic from the bristol area to london . some upgrading of the poor-quality infrastructure was undertaken , and some heavy mineral flows – continuing until as late as 1960 – passed along the line , but the severe operational constraints led to the diversion of traffic to other routes in 1964 . by that time all of the passenger traffic had dwindled to nothing and the line was closed down piece by piece . a short section of the original network remains in use serving a mod kineton .
