the panopticon is a type of institutional building and a system of control designed by the english philosopher and social theorist jeremy bentham in the 18th century . the concept of the design is to allow all prisoners of an institution to be observed by a single security guard , without the inmates being able to tell whether they are being watched . although it is physically impossible for the single guard to observe all the inmates ' cells at once , the fact that the inmates can not know when they are being watched means that they are motivated to act as though they are being watched at all times . thus , the inmates are effectively compelled to regulate their own behaviour . the architecture consists of a rotunda with an inspection house at its centre . from the centre , the manager or staff of the institution are able to watch the inmates . bentham conceived the basic plan as being equally applicable to hospitals , schools , sanitorium , and asylums , but he devoted most of his efforts to developing a design for a panopticon prison . it is his prison that is now most widely meant by the term '' panopticon '' .
