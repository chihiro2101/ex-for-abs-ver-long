retributive justice is a theory of punishment that when an offender breaks the law , justice requires that they suffer in return , and that the response to a crime is proportional to the offence . as opposed to revenge , retribution—and thus retributive justice—is not personal , is directed only at wrongdoing , has inherent limits , involves no pleasure at the suffering of others ( i.e . , schadenfreude , sadism ) , and employs procedural standards . retributive justice contrasts with other purposes of punishment such as deterrence ( prevention of future crimes ) and rehabilitation of the offender . the concept is found in most world cultures and in many ancient texts . classical texts advocating the retributive view include cicero 's de legibus ( 1st century bc ) , kant 's science of right ( 1790 ) , and hegel 's philosophy of right ( 1821 ) . the presence of retributive justice in ancient jewish culture is shown by its mention in the torah , 19:17-21 which refers to the punishments of '' life for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot '' in reference to the code of hammurabi . documents assert similar values in other cultures . however , the judgment of whether a punishment is appropriately severe can vary greatly across cultures and individuals .
