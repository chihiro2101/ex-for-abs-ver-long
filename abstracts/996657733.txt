macropsia is a neurological condition affecting human visual perception , in which objects within an affected section of the visual field appear larger than normal , causing the person to feel smaller than they actually are . macropsia , along with its opposite condition , micropsia , can be categorized under dysmetropsia . macropsia is related to other conditions dealing with visual perception , such as aniseikonia and alice in wonderland syndrome ( aiws , also known as todd 's syndrome ) . macropsia has a wide range of causes , from prescription and illicit drugs , to migraines and ( rarely ) complex partial epilepsy , and to different retinal conditions , such as epiretinal membrane . physiologically , retinal macropsia results from the compression of cones in the eye . it is the compression of receptor distribution that results in greater stimulation and thus a larger perceived image of an object .
