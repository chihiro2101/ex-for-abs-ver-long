thumb critical mass is a form of direct action in which people meet at a set location and time and travel as a group through their neighbourhoods on bikes . the idea is for people to group together to make it safe for each other to ride bicycles through their streets , based on the old mantra : there 's safety in numbers . critical mass events highlight the numbers of people who want to use their bike on the streets , but are usually unable to do so without risking their safety . they are a call to action to councils , governments and road planners to properly and thoughtfully design in the safety of all road users , including those who would prefer to walk and cycle , instead of prioritising motor traffic above all else . the event originated in 1992 in san francisco ( typically held on the last friday of every month ) ; by the end of 2003 , the event was being held in over 300 cities around the world . critical mass has been described as '' monthly political-protest rides '' , and characterized as being part of a social movement . it has been described as a '' monthly protest by cyclists reclaiming the streets . '' participants have insisted that these events should be viewed as '' celebrations '' and spontaneous gatherings , and not as protests or organized demonstrations . this stance allows critical mass to argue a legal position that its events can occur without advance notification of local police . though they are sometimes described as political , they are not necessarily .
