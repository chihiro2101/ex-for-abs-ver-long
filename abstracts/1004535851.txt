a nuclear isomer is a metastable state of an atomic nucleus , in which one or more nucleons ( protons or neutrons ) occupy excited state than in the ground state of the same nucleus . '' metastable '' describes nuclei whose excited states have half-life 100 to 1000 times longer than the half-lives of the excited nuclear states that decay with a '' prompt '' half life ( ordinarily on the order of 10 −12 seconds ) . the term '' metastable '' is usually restricted to isomers with half-lives of 10 −9 seconds or longer . some references recommend 5 × 10 −9 seconds to distinguish the metastable half life from the normal '' prompt '' gamma-emission half-life . occasionally the half-lives are far longer than this and can last minutes , hours , or years . for example , the nuclear isomer survives so long that it has never been observed to decay ( at least 10 15 years ) . the half-life of a nuclear isomer can even exceed that of the ground state of the same nuclide , as shown by as well as , and multiple holmium isomers . sometimes , the gamma decay from a metastable state is referred to as isomeric transition , but this process typically resembles shorter-lived gamma decays in all external aspects with the exception of the long-lived nature of the meta-stable parent nuclear isomer . the longer lives of nuclear isomers ' metastable states are often due to the larger degree of nuclear spin change which must be involved in their gamma emission to reach the ground state . this high spin change causes these decays to be forbidden transitions and delayed . delays in emission are caused by low or high available decay energy . the first nuclear isomer and decay-daughter system ( uranium x 2 /uranium z , now known as / ) was discovered by otto hahn in 1921 .
