but is a series of mathematical sequences . change ringing originated following the invention of english full-circle tower bell ringing in the early 17th century , when bell ringers found that swinging a bell through a much larger arc than that required for swing-chiming gave control over the time between successive strikes of the clapper . ordinarily a bell will swing through a small arc only at a set speed governed by its size and shape in the nature of a simple pendulum , but by swinging through a larger arc approaching a full circle , control of the strike interval can be exercised by the ringer . this culminated in the technique of full circle ringing , which enabled ringers to independently change the speeds of their individual bells accurately to combine in ringing different mathematical permutations , known as '' changes '' . speed control of a tower bell is exerted by the ringer only when each bell is mouth upwards and moving slowly near the balance point ; this constraint and the intricate rope manipulation involved normally requires that each bell has its own ringer . the considerable weights of full-circle tower bells also means they can not be easily stopped or started and the practical change of interval between successive strikes is limited . this places limitations on the rules for generating easily-rung changes ; each bell must strike once in each change , but its position of striking in successive changes can only change by one place . change ringing is practised worldwide , but it is by far most common on church bells in english churches , where it first developed . change ringing is also performed on handbells , where conventionally each ringer holds two bells , and chimed on carillons and chimes of bells ; though these are more commonly used to play conventional melodies .
