morus , a genus of flowering plants in the family moraceae , consists of diverse species of deciduous trees commonly known as mulberries , growing wild and under cultivation in many temperate world regions . generally , the plant has three main species ostensibly named for the fruit color of the best-known cultivar : white , red , and black mulberry ( morus alba , rubra , and nigra , respectively ) , with numerous cultivars , but more than 200 species are identified in taxonomy . the name “ white mulberry ” came about because the first specimens named by european taxonomists were a cultivated mutation prized for their white fruit , but wild trees bear black fruit like other mulberries . white mulberry is native to south asia , but is widely distributed across europe , southern africa , south america , and north america . it is regarded as an invasive species in brazil and the united states . the closely related genus broussonetia is also commonly known as mulberry , notably the paper mulberry , broussonetia papyrifera .
