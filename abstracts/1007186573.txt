john de gray or de grey ( died 18 october 1214 ) was an english prelate who served as bishop of norwich , and was elected but unconfirmed archbishop of canterbury . he was employed in the service of prince john even before john became king , for which he was rewarded with a number of ecclesiastical offices , culminating in his pro forma election to norwich in 1200 . de gray continued in royal service after his elevation to the episcopate , lending the king money and undertaking diplomatic missions on his behalf . in 1205 king john attempted to further reward de gray with a translation to the archbishopric of canterbury , but a disputed election process led to de gray 's selection being quashed by pope pope innocent iii in 1206 . innocent consecrated stephen langton as archbishop against john 's wishes , triggering a long dispute between the papacy and the king . the pope imposed various sanctions on england and john ; at one point de gray was one of only two bishops still legitimately holding office in england . in 1209 he became governor of ireland for john , and spent until 1213 attempting to impose royal government on the anglo-norman barons and the native irish in that country . recalled to england to help defend against a threatened invasion by the french , de gray then travelled to rome to secure a papal pardon after the final settlement of john and innocent 's dispute over the bishop 's abortive elevation to canterbury . after securing his pardon de gray was appointed bishop of durham , but he died on his way back to england . de gray built a palace in his diocese and several castles in ireland . although he was reviled by one contemporary writer as an '' evil counsellor '' to the king , modern historians have been more forgiving ; one praised his intelligence and others stated that de gray was one of the few men king john trusted throughout his life . de gray 's nephew , walter de gray , secured the office of lord chancellor with his uncle 's help in 1205 .
