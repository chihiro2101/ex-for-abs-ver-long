the day before the award , police arrested several jews at a demonstration of the hungarian youth organization calling for the cession of the town to hungary . their participation was then used in propaganda blaming the jews for the result ( nazi germany and fascist italy obviously did not carry out '' the wish of the jewry '' but followed their own interests ) . on 3 november 1939 , tiso met with jozef faláth ( the head of the '' central office for the jewish question '' who had already contacts to nazi politicians in vienna ) and jozef kirschbaum . tiso , who was otherwise a relatively pragmatic politician , adopted an unusually firm solution . on 4 november 1938 he ordered the deportation of jews '' without property '' , and later those without citizenship , to the territory now annexed by hungary . his government then deported more than 7,500 people including elderly people , pregnant women , and at least 570 children under age 15 to no man 's land in rainy autumn weather . on 7 november , he cancelled the action . as a prime minister and minister of the interior of the autonomous government , tiso had extensive powers . in october–december 1938 , his government did not share power with any other slovak public body , because the autonomous parliament was elected only thereafter . during this period , hsľs forbade activities of all political parties except those that agreed to join the governing coalition '' voluntarily '' and two parties representing minority populations , the '' german party '' and the '' unified hungarian party '' . hsľs then organized rigged parliamentary elections . even before the official announcement of the elections , tiso told the german newspaper völkischer beobachter that there would be only one united ballot and jews could not be elected . the deportations and some other actions of tiso 's autonomous government were against the czechoslovak constitution .
