a business rule defines or constrains some aspect of business and always resolves to either true or false . it specifically involves terms , facts and rules . business rules are intended to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business . business rules describe the operations , definitions and constraints that apply to an organization . business rules can apply to people , processes , corporate behavior and computing systems in an organization , and are put in place to help the organization achieve its goals . even though a system of strategic processes govern business rules , business rules are not strategic themselves ; they are directive . for example , a business rule might state that no credit check is to be performed on return customers . other examples of business rules include requiring a rental agent to disallow a rental tenant if their credit rating is too low , or requiring company agents to use a list of preferred suppliers and supply schedules . while a business rule may be informal or even unwritten , documenting the rules clearly and making sure that they do n't conflict is a valuable activity . when carefully managed , rules can be used to help the organization to better achieve goals , remove obstacles to market growth , reduce costly mistakes , improve communication , comply with legal requirements , and increase customer loyalty . business rules can also be applied to software , like computing systems . this software helps business organize and achieve their goals by using business rules and business logic .
