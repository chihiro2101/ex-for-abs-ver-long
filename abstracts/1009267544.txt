laser cooling includes a number of techniques in which atomic and molecular samples are cooled down to near absolute zero . laser cooling techniques rely on the fact that when an object ( usually an atom ) absorbs and re-emits a photon ( a particle of light ) its momentum changes . for an ensemble of particles , their thermodynamic temperature is proportional to the variance in their velocity . that is , more homogeneous velocities among particles corresponds to a lower temperature . laser cooling techniques combine atomic spectroscopy with the aforementioned mechanical effect of light to compress the velocity distribution of an ensemble of particles , thereby cooling the particles . } the first example of laser cooling , and also still the most common method ( so much so that it is still often referred to simply as 'laser cooling ' ) is doppler cooling . other methods of laser cooling include : sisyphus cooling laser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms nobel lecture by william d . phillips , dec 8 , 1997 : resolved sideband cooling raman cooling velocity selective coherent population trapping ( vscpt ) gray molasses cavity mediated cooling use of a zeeman slower electromagnetically induced transparency cooling anti-stokes cooling in solids
