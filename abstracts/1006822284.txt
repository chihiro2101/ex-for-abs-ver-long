suomenlinna ( finnish ; until 1918 viapori ) , or sveaborg ( swedish ) , is an inhabited sea fortress built on eight islands about 4 & nbsp ; km southeast of the city center of helsinki , the capital of finland . suomenlinna is a unesco world heritage site that is popular with tourists and locals , who enjoy it as a picturesque picnic site . originally named sveaborg ( castle of the swedes ) , or viapori as referred to by finnish-speaking finns , it was renamed in finnish to suomenlinna ( castle of finland ) in 1918 for patriotic and nationalistic reasons , though it is still known by its original name in sweden and by swedish-speaking finns . the swedish crown commenced the construction of the fortress in 1748 as protection against russian expansionism . the general responsibility for the fortification work was given to augustin ehrensv√§rd . the original plan of the bastion fortress was strongly influenced by the ideas of vauban , the foremost military engineer of the time , and the principles of the star fort style of fortification , albeit adapted to a group of rocky islands . during the finnish war , sweden surrendered the fortress to russia on 3 may 1808 , paving the way for the occupation of finland by russian forces in 1809 , and the eventual cession of finland to russia at the conclusion of the war . russia held the fortress until finnish independence in 1918 . finland then managed suomenlinna through the defense department until turning most of it over to civilian control in 1973 .
