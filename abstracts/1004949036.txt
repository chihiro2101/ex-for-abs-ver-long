a scene graph is a general data structure commonly used by vector graphics applications and modern computer games , which arranges the logical and often spatial representation of a graphical scene . it is a collection of nodes in a graph or tree structure . a tree node may have many children but only a single parent , with the effect of a parent applied to all its child nodes ; an operation performed on a group automatically propagates its effect to all of its members . in many programs , associating a geometrical transformation matrix ( see also transformation and matrix ) at each group level and concatenating such matrices together is an efficient and natural way to process such operations . a common feature , for instance , is the ability to group related shapes and objects into a compound object that can then be manipulated as easily as a single object .
