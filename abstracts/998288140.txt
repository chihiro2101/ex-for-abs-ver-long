in computer programming , an iterator is an object that enables a programmer to traverse a container , particularly lists . various types of iterators are often provided via a container 's interface . though the interface and semantics of a given iterator are fixed , iterators are often implemented in terms of the structures underlying a container implementation and are often tightly coupled to the container to enable the operational semantics of the iterator . an iterator performs traversal and also gives access to data elements in a container , but does not itself perform iteration ( i.e . , not without some significant liberty taken with that concept or with trivial use of the terminology ) . an iterator is behaviorally similar to a database cursor . iterators date to the clu programming language in 1974 .
