an extended play , often referred to as an ep , or mini-album , is a musical recording that contains more tracks than a single but is usually unqualified as an album or lp . contemporary eps generally contain a minimum of three tracks and maximum of six tracks , and are considered '' less expensive and time-consuming '' for an artist to produce than an album . an ep originally referred to specific types of vinyl records other than 78 rpm standard play ( sp ) and lp , but it is now applied to mid-length cds and downloads as well . ricardo baca of the denver post said , '' eps—originally extended-play 'single ' releases that are shorter than traditional albums—have long been popular with punk and indie bands . '' in the united kingdom , the official chart company defines a boundary between ep and album classification at 25 minutes of maximum length and no more than four tracks ( not counting alternative versions of featured songs , if present ) . a modern ep is usually defined as generally between four and six tracks , with some sources setting a maximum of seven tracks or 28 minutes .
