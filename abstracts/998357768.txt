black wednesday occurred on 16 september 1992 when the british government was forced to withdraw the pound sterling from the european exchange rate mechanism ( erm ) , after a failed attempt to keep the pound above the lower bureau de change limit mandated by the erm . at that time , the united kingdom held the presidency of the european communities . in 1997 , the hm treasury estimated the cost of black wednesday at £3.14 & nbsp ; billion , which was revised to £3.3 & nbsp ; billion in 2005 , following documents released under the freedom of information act ( earlier estimates placed losses at a much higher range of £13–27 & nbsp ; billion ) . trading losses in august and september made up a minority of the losses ( estimated at £800 & nbsp ; million ) and the majority of the loss to the central bank arose from non-realised profits of a potential devaluation . treasury papers suggested that if the government had maintained 24 & nbsp ; billion foreign currency reserves and the pound had fallen by the same amount , the uk could have made a £2.4 & nbsp ; billion profit on the pound sterling 's devaluation . the crisis damaged the credibility of the second major ministry in handling of economic matters . the ruling conservative party suffered a landslide defeat five years later at the 1997 united kingdom general election and did not return to power until 2010 . the rebounding of the british economy in the years after black wednesday led to a reassessment of the legacy of the crisis , as the major government 's adoption of an inflation targeting policy as an alternative to the erm set the foundation for a prospering economy in the years prior to the financial crisis of 2007–2008 , and the british public turned increasingly eurosceptic . mcrae , hamish ( 10 february 2005 ) . how the erm disaster turned into a triumph . the independent . retrieved 21 october 2019 . moore , charles ( 3 november 2018 ) . bring on the next black wednesday . the spectator . retrieved 21 october 2019 .
