the battle of champaubert ( 10 february 1814 ) was the opening engagement of the six days ' campaign . it was fought between a french army led by emperor napoleon and a small russian corps commanded by lieutenant general count zakhar dmitrievich olsufiev . after putting up a good fight , the russian formation was adequately destroyed ; the survivors escaped into the woods while olsufiev became a french prisoner . champaubert is located in france , west of châlons-en-champagne and east of meaux . after defeating napoleon at the battle of la rothière nine days earlier , the two main allied armies under austrian field marshal karl philipp , prince of schwarzenberg and prussian field marshal gebhard leberecht von blücher separated . schwarzenberg 's southern advance was slow while the prussian field marshal 's march represented a more serious threat to paris . leaving part of his forces to hold off schwarzenberg , napoleon massed 30,000 troops to deal with blücher , who allowed his 57,000-man army to become badly spread out . allied lapses in communication and blücher 's overconfidence left olsufiev 's corps isolated near champaubert when napoleon 's army lunged from the south to deal it a crippling blow .
