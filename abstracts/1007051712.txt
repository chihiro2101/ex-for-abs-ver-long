in meteorology , wind speed , or wind flow speed , is a fundamental atmosphere quantity caused by air moving from high to low pressure , usually due to changes in temperature . wind speed is now commonly measured with an anemometer . wind speed affects weather forecasting , aviation and maritime operations , construction projects , growth and metabolism rate of many plant species , and has countless other implications . note that wind direction is usually almost parallel to isobars ( and not perpendicular , as one might expect ) , due to earth 's rotation .
