reinke 's edema is the swelling of the vocal folds due to fluid ( edema ) collected within the reinke 's space . first identified by the german anatomist friedrich b . reinke in 1895 , the reinke 's space is a gelatinous layer of the vocal cord located underneath the outer cells of the vocal cord . f . b . reinke . untersuchungen über das menschliche stimmband . fortschritte der medizin , münchen , 1895 , 13 : 469-478 . when a person speaks , the reinke 's space vibrates to allow for sound to be produced ( phonation ) . the reinke 's space is sometimes referred to as the superficial lamina propria . reinke 's edema is characterized by the '' sac-like '' appearance of the fluid-filled vocal cords . the swelling of the vocal folds causes the voice to become deep and hoarse . therefore , the major symptom of reinke 's edema is a hoarseness similar to laryngitis . the major cause associated with reinke 's edema is smoking . in fact , 97 % of patients diagnosed with reinke 's edema are habitual smokers . other identified risk factors include overuse of the vocal cords , gastroesophageal reflux , and hypothyroidism . the disease is more often cited in women than in men , because lower voice changes are more noticeable in women . the first cases of reinke 's edema were recorded in 1891 by m . hajek , followed by f . reinke in 1895 . in his investigations , reinke injected a stained glue into the superficial lamina propria ( reinke 's space ) to mimic edema . reinke 's edema is considered to be a benign ( non-cancercous ) polyp ( protrusion ) that represents 10 % of all benign larynx pathologies . treatment of reinke 's edema starts with the elimination of associated risk factors , such as smoking , gastric reflux , and hypothyroidism . advanced cases may undergo phonosurgery to remove the fluid from the vocal cords .
