the pudendal nerve is the main nerve of the perineum . it carries sensation from the external genitalia of both sexes and the skin around the anus and perineum , as well as the motor supply to various pelvic muscles , including the male or female external urethral sphincter and the external anal sphincter . if damaged , most commonly by childbirth , lesions may cause sensory loss or fecal incontinence . the nerve may be temporarily blocked as part of an pudendal anesthesia . the pudendal canal that carries the pudendal nerve is also known by the eponymous term '' alcock 's canal '' , after benjamin alcock , an irish anatomist who documented the canal in 1836 .
