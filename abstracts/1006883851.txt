the thames and severn canal is a canal in gloucestershire in the south of england , which was completed in 1789 . it was conceived as part of a canal route from bristol to london . at its eastern end , it connects to the river thames at inglesham lock near lechlade , while at its western end , it connects to the stroudwater navigation at wallbridge near stroud , and thence to the river severn . it has one short arm ( branch ) , from siddington to the town of cirencester . it includes sapperton tunnel , which when built was the longest canal tunnel in britain , and remains the second-longest complete tunnel . there were always problems with water supply , as no reservoirs were built , while the summit section near the tunnel ran through porous limestone , and there were constant difficulties with leakage . competition from the railways took much of the canal 's traffic by the end of the 19th century , and most of the canal was abandoned in 1927 , the remainder in 1941 . since 1972 , the cotswold canals trust has been working to restore both the canal and the stroudwater navigation to navigably re-link the thames and the severn . a number of the structures have been restored , and some sections are now in water . a major step forward occurred in 2003 , when a bid was made to the heritage lottery fund for £82 & nbsp ; million to restore both canals . the bid and the project had to be split into smaller sections , but £11.9 & nbsp ; million was awarded in 2006 for phase 1a , which with matched funding will restore from 'the ocean ' at stonehouse to wallbridge on the navigation , and from there to brimscombe port on the canal . in 2010 , british waterways gave inglesham lock to the trust , and the inland waterways association mounted a national campaign to fund its restoration ( and of canal above ) . to re-open the whole canal some major engineering obstacles will need to be overcome .
