hammer 's horror films were often praised by critics for their visual style , although rarely taken seriously . '' altogether this is a horrific film and sometimes a crude film , but by no means an unimpressive piece of melodramatic storytelling '' wrote one critic of dracula in the times in 1958 . critics who specialise in cult films , like kim newman , have praised hammer horror more fully , enjoying their atmosphere , craftsmanship and occasional camp appeal . in a history of horror , mark gatiss remarked that hammer 's earlier films were taken seriously at the time , in comparison to the trademark camp appeal of their later works . in a 2013 retrospective for the guardian , michael newton wrote : shot in eastmancolor , the first batch of hammer horror movies – terence fisher 's the curse of frankenstein ( 1957 ) , dracula ( 1958 ) and the mummy ( 1959 ) – are among the loveliest-looking british films of the decade . the early hammer films offer a last gasp of british romanticism , the solid sets drenched in a soft brilliance of shadows , of greys , reds and blues ; when these films stray into the far woods , it 's always autumn there , never spring . the leaves fall , and the light shines golden and clear ; compared with the well-lit contemporary look of the '' angry young men '' films , hammer 's mournful sumptuousness must have been even more striking . they play out a 1950s reverie of contagion , lust and post-suez anxiety . questions of guilt circulate in these films , where the virtuous can be transformed into vampires through one moment of sexual weakness .
