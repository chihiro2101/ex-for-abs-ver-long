the geology of the appalachians dates back to more than 480 million years ago . a look at rocks exposed in today 's appalachian mountains reveals elongate belts of folded and thrust faulted marine sedimentary rocks , volcanic rocks and slivers of ophiolite â€“ strong evidence that these rocks were deformed during plate tectonics . the birth of the appalachian ranges marks the first of several mountain building plate collisions that culminated in the construction of the supercontinent pangaea with the appalachians and neighboring little atlas ( now in morocco ) near the center . these mountain ranges likely once reached elevations similar to those of the alps and the rocky mountains before they were eroded .
