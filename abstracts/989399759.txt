link-state routing protocols are one of the two main classes of routing protocols used in packet switching networks for computer communications , the other being distance-vector routing protocols . examples of link-state routing protocols include open shortest path first ( ospf ) and is-is ( is-is ) . the link-state protocol is performed by every switching node in the network ( i.e . , nodes that are prepared to forward packets ; in the internet , these are called routers ) . the basic concept of link-state routing is that every node constructs a map of the connectivity to the network , in the form of a graph , showing which nodes are connected to which other nodes . each node then independently calculates the next best logical path from it to every possible destination in the network . each collection of best paths will then form each node 's routing table . this contrasts with distance-vector routing protocols , which work by having each node share its routing table with its neighbours , in a link-state protocol the only information passed between nodes is connectivity related . link-state algorithms are sometimes characterized informally as each router , '' telling the world about its neighbors .
