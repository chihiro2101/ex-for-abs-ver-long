bruxism is excessive teeth grinding or jaw clenching . it is an oral parafunctional habit ; i.e . , it is unrelated to normal function such as eating or talking . bruxism is a common behavior ; reports of prevalence range from 8 % to 31 % in the general population . several symptoms are commonly associated with bruxism , including hypersensitive teeth , aching jaw muscles , headaches , tooth wear , and damage to dental restorations ( e.g . crowns and fillings ) . symptoms may be minimal , without patient awareness of the condition . there are two main types of bruxism : one occurs during sleep ( nocturnal bruxism ) and one during wakefulness ( awake bruxism ) . dental damage may be similar in both types , but the symptoms of sleep bruxism tend to be worse on waking and improve during the course of the day , and the symptoms of awake bruxism may not be present at all on waking , and then worsen over the day . the causes of bruxism are not completely understood , but probably involve multiple factors . awake bruxism is more common in women , whereas men and women are affected in equal proportions by sleep bruxism . awake bruxism is thought to have different causes from sleep bruxism . several treatments are in use , although there is little evidence of robust efficacy for any particular treatment .
