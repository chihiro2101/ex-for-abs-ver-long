the feet of chameleons are highly adapted to arboreal locomotion , and species such as chamaeleo namaquensis that have secondarily adopted a terrestrial habit have retained the same foot morphology with little modification . on each foot , the five clearly distinguished toes are grouped into two fascicles . the toes in each fascicle are bound into a flattened group of either two or three , giving each foot a tongs-like appearance . on the front feet , the outer , lateral , group contains two toes , whereas the inner , medial , group contains three . on the rear feet , this arrangement is reversed , the medial group containing two toes , and the lateral group three . these specialized feet allow chameleons to grip tightly onto narrow or rough branches . furthermore , each toe is equipped with a sharp claw to afford a grip on surfaces such as bark when climbing . it is common to refer to the feet of chameleons as dactyly or dactyly , though neither term is fully satisfactory , both being used in describing totally different feet , such as the zygodactyl feet of parrots or didactyl feet of sloths or ostriches , none of which is significantly like chameleon feet . although '' zygodactyl '' is reasonably descriptive of chameleon foot anatomy , their foot structure does not resemble that of parrots , to which the term was first applied . as for didactyly , chameleons visibly have five toes on each foot , not two . some chameleons have a crest of small spikes extending along the spine from the proximal part of the tail to the neck ; both the extent and size of the spikes varies between species and individuals . these spikes help break up the definitive outline of the chameleon , which aids it when trying to blend into a background .
