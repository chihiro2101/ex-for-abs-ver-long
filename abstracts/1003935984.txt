female ejaculation is characterized as an expulsion of fluid from the skene 's gland at the lower end of the urethra during or before an orgasm . it is also known colloquially as squirting ( or gushing ) , although research indicates that female ejaculation and squirting are different phenomena , with squirting being attributed to a sudden expulsion of liquid that partly comes from the bladder and contains urine . female ejaculation is physiologically distinct from coital incontinence , with which it is sometimes confused . there have been few studies on female ejaculation . a failure to adopt common definitions and research methodology by the scientific community has been the primary contributor to this lack of experimental data . research has suffered from highly selected participants , narrow case studies , or very small sample sizes , and consequently has yet to produce significant results . much of the research into the composition of the fluid focuses on determining whether it is , or contains , urine . it is common for any secretion that exits the vagina , and for fluid that exits the urethra , during sexual activity to be referred to as female ejaculate , which has led to significant confusion in the literature . whether the fluid is secreted by the skene 's gland through and around the urethra has also been a topic of discussion ; while the exact source and nature of the fluid remain controversial among medical professionals , and are related to doubts over the existence of the g-spot , there is substantial evidence that the skene 's gland is the source of female ejaculation . the function of female ejaculation , however , remains unclear .
