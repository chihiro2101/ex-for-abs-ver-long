a white christmas is a christmas with the presence of snow : either on christmas eve or on christmas , depending on local tradition . this phenomenon is most common in the northern countries of the northern hemisphere . because december is at the beginning of the southern hemisphere summer , white christmases there are extremely rare , except in antarctica ( uninhabited ) , in the southern alps / kƒÅ tiritiri o te moana of new zealand 's south island , and in parts of the andes in south america as well as the southern tip of the continent , in places like ushuaia , argentina . the opposite of a white christmas , when there is no snow and thus the ground is bare , is traditionally known as a '' green christmas , '' from the color of bare grass . the notion of '' white christmas '' was popularized by writings of charles dickens . the depiction of snow-covered christmas season found in the pickwick papers ( 1836 ) , a christmas carol ( 1843 ) , and his short stories was apparently influenced by memories of his childhood , which coincided with the coldest decade in england in more than a century . the song , '' white christmas '' , written by irving berlin and sung by bing crosby ( with the ken darby singers and john scott trotter and his orchestra ) and featured in the 1942 paramount pictures film holiday inn , is the best-selling single of all time and speaks nostalgically of a traditional white christmas and has since become a seasonal standard .
