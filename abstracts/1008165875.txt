in the bible , the name azazel ; ʿazāʾzēl ; appears in association with the scapegoat rite ; the name represents a desolate place where a scapegoat bearing the sins of the jews during yom kippur was sent . during the end of the second temple period , his association as a fallen angel responsible for introducing humans to forbidden knowledge emerged due to hellenization , christian narrative , and interpretation exemplified in the book of enoch . his role as a fallen angel partly remains in christian and islamic traditions .
