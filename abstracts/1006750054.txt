a bicycle brake reduces the speed of a bicycle or prevents it from moving . the three main types are : rim brakes , disc brakes , and drum brakes . most bicycle brake systems consist of three main components : a mechanism for the rider to apply the brakes , such as brake levers or pedals ; a mechanism for transmitting that signal , such as bowden cables , hydraulic hoses , rods , or the bicycle chain ; and the brake mechanism itself , a caliper or drum , to press two or more surfaces together in order to convert , via friction , kinetic energy of the bike and rider into thermal energy to be dissipated .
