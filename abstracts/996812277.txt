micropsia is a condition affecting human visual perception in which objects are perceived to be smaller than they actually are . micropsia can be caused by optical factors ( such as wearing glasses ) , by distortion of images in the eye ( such as optically , via swelling of the cornea or from changes in the shape of the retina such as from retinal edema , macular degeneration , or central serous retinopathy ) , by changes in the brain ( such as from traumatic brain injury , epilepsy , migraines , prescription drugs , and illicit drugs ) , and from psychological factors . dissociative phenomena are linked with micropsia , which may be the result of brain-lateralization disturbance . micropsia is also commonly reported when the eyes are fixating at ( convergence ) , or focussing at ( accommodation ) , a distance closer than that of the object in accord with emmert 's law . specific types of micropsia include hemimicropsia , a form of micropsia that is localized to one half of the visual field and can be caused by brain lesions in one of the cerebral hemispheres . related visual distortion conditions include macropsia , a less common condition with the reverse effect , and alice in wonderland syndrome , a condition that has symptoms that can include both micropsia and macropsia .
