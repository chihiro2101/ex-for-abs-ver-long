sybaris ; was an important city of magna graecia . it was situated on the gulf of taranto , in southern italy , between two rivers , the crathis ( crati ) and the sybaris ( coscile ) . the city was founded in 720 & nbsp ; bc by achaean and troezenian settlers . sybaris amassed great wealth thanks to its fertile land and busy port . its inhabitants became famous among the greeks for their hedonism , feasts , and excesses , to the extent that '' sybarite '' and '' sybaritic '' have become bywords for opulence , luxury and outrageous pleasure-seeking . in 510/09 & nbsp ; bc the city was subjugated by its neighbor kroton and its population driven out . sybaris became a dependent ally of kroton , but kroton again besieged the city in 476/5 & nbsp ; bc , probably resulting in another victory for kroton . two attempts to reoccupy the city failed around 452/1 & nbsp ; bc and 446/5 & nbsp ; bc when the remaining sybarites were again expelled by the krotoniates . after a call for help the sybarites reoccupied their city later in 446/5 & nbsp ; bc with the assistance of new settlers from athens and other cities in the peloponnese . this coexistence did not last long : the sybarites got into a conflict with the new colonists and were ousted for the last time in the summer of 445 bc . in sum , the city saw a total of five periods of occupation separated by expulsion . the new settlers then proceeded to found the city of thurii in 444/3 & nbsp ; bc , a new colony which was built partially on top of the site of sybaris . the surviving sybarites founded sybaris on the traeis . the ruins of sybaris and thurii became forgotten as they were buried by sediment from the crati river over time . the ruins were rediscovered and excavated in the 1960s by donald freeman brown . today they can be found southeast of sibari , a frazione in the comune of cassano allo ionio in the province of cosenza , calabria region , italy .
