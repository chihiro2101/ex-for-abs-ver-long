hms good hope was one of four drake-class armoured cruisers built for the royal navy around 1900 ; she was originally named africa , but was renamed before she was launched . she became flagship of the 1st cruiser squadron of the atlantic fleet in 1906 , and was the flagship of the 2nd cruiser squadron in 1908 . she was reduced to reserve in 1913 , but was recommissioned in mid-1914 . when war was declared in august 1914 , good hope was ordered to reinforce the 4th cruiser squadron and became the flagship of rear admiral christopher cradock . cradock moved the available ships of his squadron later that month to the coast of south america to search for german commerce raiders . he was then ordered further south to the strait of magellan to block any attempt of the german east asia squadron to penetrate into the south atlantic . he found the german squadron on 1 november off the coast of chile . the german squadron outnumbered cradock 's force and were individually more powerful ; they sank cradock 's two armoured cruisers in the battle of coronel . good hope was lost with all hands .
