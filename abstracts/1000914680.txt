buc : mìng ngṳ̄ ) is a broad group of sinitic languages spoken by about 30 million people in fujian province as well as by the descendants of min speaking colonists on leizhou peninsula and hainan , or assimilated natives of chaoshan , parts of zhongshan , three counties in southern wenzhou , zhoushan archipelago , and taiwan . the name is derived from the min river in fujian , which is also the abbreviated name of fujian province . min varieties are not mutually intelligible with one another nor with any other variety of chinese . there are many min speakers among overseas chinese in southeast asia . the most widely spoken variety of min outside fujian is southern min ( min nan ) , also known as hokkien ( which includes taiwanese and amoy ) . many min languages have retained notable features of old chinese , and there is linguistic evidence that not all min varieties are directly descended from middle chinese of the sui–tang dynasties . min languages are believed to have a significant linguistic substrate from the languages of the inhabitants of the region prior to its sinicization .
