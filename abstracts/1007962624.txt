the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , or nubecula minor , is a dwarf galaxy near the milky way . classified as a dwarf irregular galaxy , the smc has a diameter of about 7,000 light-years , contains several hundred million stars , and has a total mass of approximately 7 billion solar masses . nasa ads - the total mass and dark halo properties of the small magellanic cloud the smc contains a central bar structure , and astronomers speculate that it was once a barred spiral galaxy that was disrupted by the milky way to become somewhat irregular . at a distance of about 200,000 light-years , the smc is among the nearest intergalactic neighbors of the milky way and is one of the most distant objects visible to the naked eye . the smc is visible from the entire southern hemisphere , but can be fully glimpsed low above the southern horizon from tropics south of about 15° north . the galaxy is located across both the constellations of tucana and part of hydrus , appearing as a faint hazy patch resembling a detached piece of the milky way . the smc has an average apparent diameter of about 4.2° ( 8 times the moon 's ) and thus covers an area of about 14 square degrees ( 70 times the moon 's ) . since its surface brightness is very low , this deep-sky object is best seen on clear new moon nights and away from city lights . the smc forms a pair with the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , which lies 20° to the east , and like the lmc , is a member of the local group and highly probably is a former satellite of the large magellanic cloud and a current satellite of the milky way .
