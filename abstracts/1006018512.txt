in statistical hypothesis testing , a result has statistical significance when it is very unlikely to have occurred given the null hypothesis . more precisely , a study 's defined significance level , denoted by \alpha , is the probability of the study rejecting the null hypothesis , given that the null hypothesis was assumed to be true ; and the p-value of a result , p , is the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme , given that the null hypothesis is true . the result is statistically significant , by the standards of the study , when p \le \alpha . the significance level for a study is chosen before data collection , and is typically set to 5 % or much lowerâ€”depending on the field of study . in any experiment or observation that involves drawing a sample from a population , there is always the possibility that an observed effect would have occurred due to sampling error alone . but if the p-value of an observed effect is less than ( or equal to ) the significance level , an investigator may conclude that the effect reflects the characteristics of the whole population , thereby rejecting the null hypothesis . this technique for testing the statistical significance of results was developed in the early 20th century . the term significance does not imply importance here , and the term statistical significance is not the same as research , theoretical , or practical significance . for example , the term clinical significance refers to the practical importance of a treatment effect .
