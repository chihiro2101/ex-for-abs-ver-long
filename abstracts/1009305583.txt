a kerosene lamp ( also known as a paraffin lamp in some countries ) is a type of lighting device that uses kerosene as a fuel . kerosene lamps have a wick or mantle as light source , protected by a glass chimney or globe ; lamps may be used on a table , or hand-held lanterns may be used for portable lighting . like oil lamps , they are useful for lighting without electricity , such as in regions without rural electrification , in electrified areas during power outages , at campsites , and on boats . there are three types of kerosene lamp : flat-wick , central-draught ( tubular round wick ) , and mantle lamp . kerosene lanterns meant for portable use have a flat wick and are made in dead-flame , hot-blast , and cold-blast variants . pressurized kerosene lamps use a gas mantle ; these are known as petromax , tilley lamps , or coleman lamps , among other manufacturers . they produce more light per unit of fuel than wick-type lamps , but are more complex and expensive in construction and more complex to operate . a hand-pump pressurizes air , which forces liquid fuel from a reservoir into a gas chamber . vapor from the chamber burns , heating a mantle to incandescence and also providing heat . kerosene lamps are widely used for lighting in rural areas of africa and asia , where electricity is not distributed or is too costly . kerosene lamps consume an estimated 77 billion litres of fuel per year , equivalent to 1.3 million barrels of oil per day , jean-claude bolay , alexandre schmid , gabriela tejada technologies and innovations for development : scientific cooperation for a sustainable future , springer , 2012 page 308 . comparable to annual u.s . jet-fuel consumption of 76 billion litres per year . ^ energy information administration .
