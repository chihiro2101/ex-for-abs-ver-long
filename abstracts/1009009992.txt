a pattern language is an organized and coherent set of patterns , each of which describes a problem and the core of a solution that can be used in many ways within a specific field of expertise . the term was coined by architect christopher alexander and popularized by his 1977 book a pattern language . a pattern language can also be an attempt to express the deeper wisdom of what brings aliveness within a particular field of human endeavor , through a set of interconnected patterns . aliveness is one placeholder term for '' the quality that has no name '' : a sense of wholeness , spirit , or grace , that while of varying form , is precise and empirically verifiable . some advocates of this design approach claim that ordinary people can use it to successfully solve very large , complex design problems .
