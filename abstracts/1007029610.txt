religious persecution is the systematic mistreatment of an individual or a group of individuals as a response to their religion or their irreligion . the tendency of societies or groups within societies to alienate or repress different subcultures is a recurrent theme in human history . moreover , because a person 's religion often determines his or her morality , world view , self-image , attitudes towards others , and overall personal identity to a significant extent , religious differences can be significant cultural , personal , and social factors . religious persecution may be triggered by religious bigotry ( i.e . when members of a dominant group denigrate religions other than their own ) or it may be triggered by the state when it views a particular religious group as a threat to its interests or security . at a societal level , the dehumanisation of a particular religious group may readily lead to violence or other forms of persecution . indeed , in many countries , religious persecution has resulted in so much violence that it is considered a human rights problem .
