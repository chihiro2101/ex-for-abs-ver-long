a period 6 element is one of the chemical elements in the sixth row ( or period ) of the periodic table , including the lanthanides . the periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate recurring ( periodic ) trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases : a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat , meaning that elements with similar behaviour fall into the same vertical columns . the sixth period contains 32 elements , tied for the most with period 7 , beginning with caesium and ending with radon . lead is currently the last stable element ; all subsequent elements are radioactive . for bismuth , however , its only primordial isotope , 209 bi , has a half-life of more than 10 19 years , over a billion times longer than the current age of the universe . as a rule , period 6 elements fill their 6s shells first , then their 4f , 5d , and 6p shells , in that order ; however , there are exceptions , such as gold .
