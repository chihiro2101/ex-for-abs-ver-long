sir hans adolf krebs ; 25 august 1900 â€“ 22 november 1981 ) was a german-born british biologist , physician and biochemist . he was a pioneer scientist in the study of cellular respiration , a biochemical process in living cells that extracts energy from food and oxygen and makes it available to drive the processes of life . he is best known for his discoveries of two important sequences of chemical reactions that take place in the cells of humans and many other organisms , namely the citric acid cycle and the urea cycle . the former , often eponymously known as the '' krebs cycle '' , is the key sequence of metabolic reactions that provides energy in the cells of humans and other aerobic organism ; and its discovery earned krebs a nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1953 . with hans kornberg , he also discovered the glyoxylate cycle , which is a slight variation of the citric acid cycle found in plants , bacteria , protists , and fungi . krebs died in 1981 in oxford , where he had spent 13 years of his career from 1954 until his retirement in 1967 at the university of oxford .
