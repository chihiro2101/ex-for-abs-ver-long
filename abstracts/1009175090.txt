a remix is a piece of media which has been altered or contorted from its original state by adding , removing , and changing pieces of the item . a song , piece of artwork , books , video , poem , or photograph can all be remixes . the only characteristic of a remix is that it appropriates and changes other materials to create something new . most commonly , remixes are a subset of audio mixing in music and song recordings . songs may be remixed for a variety of reasons : to adapt or revise a song for radio or nightclub play to create a stereo or surround sound version of a song where none was previously available to improve the fidelity of an older song for which the original master has been lost or degraded to alter a song to suit a specific music genre or radio format to use some of the same materials , allowing the song to reach a different audience to alter a song for artistic purposes to provide additional versions of a song for use as bonus tracks or for a b-side , for example , in times when a cd single might carry a total of 4 tracks to create a connection between a smaller artist and a more successful one , as was the case with fatboy slim 's remix of '' brimful of asha '' by cornershop to improve the first or demo mix of the song , generally to ensure a professional product . to provide an alternative version of a song to improve a song from its original state remixes should not be confused with edits , which usually involve shortening a final stereo master for marketing or broadcasting purposes . another distinction should be made between a remix , which recombines audio pieces from a recording to create an altered version of a song , and a cover : a re-recording of someone else 's song . while audio mixing is one of the most popular and recognized forms of remixing , this is not the only media form which is remixed in numerous examples . literature , film , technology , and social systems can all be argued as a form of remix . everything is a remix
