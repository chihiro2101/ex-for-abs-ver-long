the emergency alert system ( eas ) is a national warning system in the united states put into place on january 1 , 1997 ( approved by the federal communications commission ( fcc ) in november 1994 ) , when it replaced the emergency broadcast system ( ebs ) , which in turn replaced conelrad . it is jointly coordinated by the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) , the federal communications commission ( fcc ) and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) . the eas regulations and standards are governed by the public safety and homeland security bureau of the fcc . as with its predecessors , the system is primarily designed to allow the president to address the country via all radio and television stations , in the event of a national emergency . despite this , neither the system nor its predecessors have been used in this manner , due to the 24-hour news cycle in these situations . in practice , it is more commonly used to distribute information regarding imminent threats to public safety , such as severe weather situations ( including flash floods and tornadoes ) , amber alerts of child abductions , and other civil emergencies . authorized organizations are able to disseminate and coordinate emergency alerts and warning messages through eas . the integrated public alert and warning system ( ipaws ) is used as a backend to distribute alert information via eas and related technologies such as wireless emergency alerts ( wea ) , using common alerting protocol ( cap ) . eas messages are transmitted primarily via terrestrial and satellite radio and television ( including broadcast and multichannel television ) , which are required to participate in the system .
