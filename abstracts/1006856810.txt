in colorimetry , the munsell color system is a color space that specifies colors based on three properties of color : hue ( basic color ) , chroma ( color intensity ) , and value ( lightness ) . it was created by professor albert h . munsell in the first decade of the 20th century and adopted by the united states department of agriculture ( usda ) as the official color system for soil research in the 1930s . several earlier color order systems had placed colors into a three-dimensional color solid of one form or another , but munsell was the first to separate hue , value , and chroma into perceptually uniform and independent dimensions , and he was the first to illustrate the colors systematically in three-dimensional space . kuehni ( 2002 ) , p . 21 munsell 's system , particularly the later renotations , is based on rigorous measurements of human subjects ' color vision to color , putting it on a firm experimental scientific basis . because of this basis in human visual perception , munsell 's system has outlasted its contemporary color models , and though it has been superseded for some uses by models such as cielab ( l a b ) and ciecam02 , it is still in wide use today . landa ( 2005 ) , pp . 437â€“438 ,
