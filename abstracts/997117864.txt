a writ of prohibition is a writ directing a subordinate to stop doing something the law prohibits . this writ is often issued by a superior court to the lower court directing it not to proceed with a case which does not fall under its jurisdiction . writs of prohibition can be subdivided into '' alternative writs '' and '' peremptory writs '' . an alternative writ directs the recipient to immediately act , or desist , and '' show cause '' why the directive should not be made permanent . a peremptory writ directs the recipient to immediately act , or desist , and '' return '' the writ , with certification of its compliance , within a certain time . when an agency of an official body is the target of the writ of prohibition , the writ is directed to the official body over which the court has direct jurisdiction , ordering the official body to cause the agency to desist . although the rest of this article speaks to judicial processes , a writ of prohibition may be directed by any court of record ( i.e . , higher than a misdemeanor court ) toward any official body , whether a court or a county , city or town government , that is within the court 's jurisdiction .
