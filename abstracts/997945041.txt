thumb a transmembrane protein ( tp ) is a type of integral membrane protein that spans the entirety of the cell membrane . many transmembrane proteins function as membrane transport protein of specific substances across the membrane . they frequently undergo significant protein dynamics to move a substance through the membrane . they are usually highly hydrophobic and aggregate and precipitate in water . they require detergents or nonpolar solvents for extraction , although some of them ( beta-barrels ) can be also extracted using denaturing agents . the peptide sequence that spans the membrane , or the transmembrane domain , is largely hydrophobic and can be visualized using the hydropathy plot . depending on the number of transmembrane segments , transmembrane proteins can be classified as single-span ( or bitopic ) or multi-span ( polytopic ) . some other integral membrane proteins are called monotopic , meaning that they are also permanently attached to the membrane , but do not pass through it .
