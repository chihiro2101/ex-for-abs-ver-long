the following is a list of notable unsolved problems grouped into broad areas of physics . some of the major unsolved problems in physics are theoretical , meaning that existing theory seem incapable of explaining a certain observed phenomenon or experimental result . the others are experimental , meaning that there is a difficulty in creating an experiment to test a proposed theory or investigate a phenomenon in greater detail . there are still some questions physics beyond the standard model , such as the strong cp problem , neutrino mass , matter–antimatter asymmetry , and the nature of dark matter and dark energy . another problem lies within the quantum field theory of the standard model itself—the standard model is inconsistent with that of general relativity , to the point that one or both theories break down under certain conditions ( for example within known spacetime singularities like the big bang and the centres of black holes beyond the event horizon ) .
