loa loa is a filarial ( arthropod-borne ) nematode ( roundworm ) that causes loa loa filariasis . loa loa actually means '' worm worm '' , but is commonly known as the '' eye worm '' , as it localizes to the conjunctiva of the eye . loa loa is commonly found in africa . schmidt , gerald et al . '' foundations of parasitology '' . 7th ed . mcgraw hill , new york , ny , 2005 . it mainly inhabits rain forests in west africa and has native origins in ethiopia . the disease caused by loa loa is called loiasis and belongs to the so-called neglected diseases . l . loa is one of three parasitic filarial nematodes that cause subcutaneous filariasis in humans . the other two are mansonella streptocerca and onchocerca volvulus ( causes river blindness ) . maturing larvae and adults of the '' eye worm '' occupy the subcutaneous layer of the skin – the fat layer – of humans , causing disease . the l . loa adult worm which travels under the skin can survive up to 10–15 years , causing inflammations known as calabar swellings . the adult worm travels under the skin , where the female deposits the microfilariae which can develop in the host ’ s blood within 5 to 6 months and can survive up to 17 years . the young larvae , or microfilariae , develop in horseflies of the genus chrysops ( deer flies , yellow flies ) , including the species c . dimidiata and c . silacea , which infect humans by biting them . after bites from these infected flies , the microfilariae are unique in that they travel in the peripheral blood during the day and migrate into the lungs at night . turkington , c . , & ashby , b .
