a person 's second language , or l2 , is a language that is not the native language ( first language or l1 ) of the speaker , but is learned later ( usually as a foreign language , but it can be another language used in the speaker 's home country ) . a speaker 's dominant language , which is the language a speaker uses most or is most comfortable with , is not necessarily the speaker 's first language . the second language can also be the dominant one . for example , the canadian census defines first language for its purposes as '' the first language learned in childhood and still spoken '' , recognizing that for some , the earliest language may be lost , a process known as language attrition . this can happen when young children move to a new language environment .
