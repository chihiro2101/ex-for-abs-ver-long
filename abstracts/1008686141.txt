unable to generate any follow-up success , the group disbanded in 1966 . the paramounts were signed to emi uk for their releases ; until one day before procol harum linked with emi uk again , they were called the pinewoods . a last-minute offer from chris blackwell 's fledgling island records label was rejected by brooker and band . in april 1967 , brooker began working as a singer-songwriter and formed procol harum with non-paramounts keith reid ( poet ) , hammond organist matthew fisher , guitarist ray royer and bassist david knights . guy stevens , their original manager , named the band after a burmese cat , which had been bred by eleonore vogt-chapman and belonged to liz coombes . the cat 's '' cat fancy '' name was procul harun , procul being the breeder 's prefix . in the absence of a definitive origin , the band 's name has attracted various interpretations , being said to be ( incorrect ) latin for '' beyond these things '' ; the correct latin would be procul hÄ«s . the name of the band is frequently misspelled ; often with '' procul '' , '' harem '' , both , or other variations .
