world series cricket ( wsc ) was a professional cricket competition staged between 1977 and 1979 and organised by kerry packer for his australian television network , nine network . a break away competition , the matches ran in opposition to established international cricket . world series cricket drastically changed the nature of cricket , and its influence continues to be felt today . two main factors caused the formation of wscâ€”the widespread view that players were not paid sufficient amounts to make a living from cricket , and that packer wished to secure the exclusive broadcasting rights to australian cricket , then held by the australian broadcasting commission ( abc ) . after the cricket australia ( acb ) refused to accept channel nine 's bid to gain exclusive television rights to australia 's test matches in 1976 , packer set up his own series by secretly signing agreements with leading australian , english , pakistani , south african and west indian players , most notably england captain tony greig , west indies captain clive lloyd , australian captain greg chappell , future pakistani captain imran khan and former australian captain ian chappell . packer was aided by businessmen john cornell and austin robertson , both of whom were involved with the initial setup and administration of the series .
