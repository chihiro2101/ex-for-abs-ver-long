the douglas dc-3 is a propeller-driven airliner which had a lasting effect on the airline industry in the 1930s/1940s and world war ii . it was developed as a larger , improved 14-bed sleeper version of the douglas dc-2 . it is a low-wing metal monoplane with conventional landing gear , powered by two radial piston engines of . ( although most dc-3s flying today use pratt & whitney r-1830 twin wasp engines , many dc-3s built for civil service originally had the wright r-1820 cyclone . ) the dc-3 has a cruise speed of , a capacity of 21 to 32 passengers or 6,000 & nbsp ; lbs ( 2,700 & nbsp ; kg ) of cargo , and a range of , and can operate from short runways . the dc-3 had many exceptional qualities compared to previous aircraft . it was fast , had a good range , was more reliable , and carried passengers in greater comfort . before the war , it pioneered many air travel routes . it was able to cross the continental us from new york to los angeles in 18 hours and with only 3 stops . it is one of the first airliners that could profitably carry only passengers without relying on mail subsidies . following the war , the airliner market was flooded with surplus transport aircraft and the dc-3 was no longer competitive due to its size and speed . it was made obsolete on main routes by more advanced types such as the douglas dc-4 and lockheed constellation , but the design proved adaptable and useful on less glamorous routes . civil dc-3 production ended in 1942 at 607 aircraft . military versions , including the c-47 skytrain ( the dakota in british raf service ) , and soviet- and japanese-built versions , brought total production to over 16,000 . many continue to see service in a variety of niche roles : 2,000 dc-3s and military derivatives were estimated to be still flying in 2013 ; a 2017 article put the number at that time at more than 300 .
