the river avon in central england flows generally southwestwards and is a major left-bank tributary of the river severn , of which it is the easternmost . it is also known as the warwickshire avon or shakespeare 's avon , to distinguish it from several other rivers of the same name in the united kingdom . beginning in northamptonshire , the river flows through or adjoining the county of leicestershire , northamptonshire , warwickshire , worcestershire and gloucestershire , near the cotswold hills area . notable towns it flows through include rugby , warwick , stratford-upon-avon , evesham , pershore and tewkesbury , where it joins the severn . it has traditionally been divided since 1719 into the lower avon , below evesham , and the upper avon , from evesham to above stratford-upon-avon . improvements to aid navigation began in 1635 , and a series of locks and weirs made it possible to reach stratford , and to within of warwick . the upper avon was tortuous and prone to flooding , and was abandoned as a means of navigation in 1877 . the lower avon struggled on , and never really closed , although it was only navigable below pershore by 1945 . restoration of the lower river as a navigable waterway began in 1950 , and was completed in 1962 . the upper river was a more daunting task , as most of the locks and weirs were no longer extant . work began in 1965 on the construction of nine new locks and of river , using mainly volunteer labour , and was completed in 1974 when it was opened by elizabeth bowes-lyon . the avon connects with the stratford-upon-avon canal in the centre of stratford , and is used primarily by leisure craft . plans to extend the navigable river to provide a link with the grand union canal at either warwick or leamington spa have met with some opposition .
