an armed merchantman is a merchant ship equipped with guns , usually for defensive purposes , either by design or after the fact . in the days of sail , piracy and privateers , many merchantmen would be routinely armed , especially those engaging in long distance and high value trade . in more modern times , auxiliary cruisers were used offensively as merchant raiders to disrupt trade chiefly during both world war i and world war ii , particularly by germany . while armed merchantmen are clearly inferior to purpose-built warships , sometimes they have scored successes in combat against them . examples include east indiaman mimicking ship of the line and chasing off regular french warships in the battle of pulo aura in 1804 , and the sinking the australian light cruiser in their battle in 1941 , although kormoran was also destroyed and had to be scuttled .
