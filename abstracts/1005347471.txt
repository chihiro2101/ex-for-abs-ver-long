aluminium hydroxide , al ( oh ) 3 , is found in nature as the mineral gibbsite ( also known as hydrargillite ) and its three much rarer polymorphs : bayerite , doyleite , and nordstrandite . aluminium hydroxide is amphoteric in nature , i.e . , it has both basic and acidic properties . closely related are aluminium oxide hydroxide , alo ( oh ) , and aluminium oxide or alumina ( al 2 o 3 ) , the latter of which is also amphoteric . these compounds together are the major components of the aluminium ore bauxite .
