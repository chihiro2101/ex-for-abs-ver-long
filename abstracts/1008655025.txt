the sherry is fortified using destilado , made by distilling wine , usually from la mancha . the distilled spirit is first mixed with mature sherry to make a 50/50 blend known as mitad y mitad ( half and half ) , and then the mitad y mitad is mixed with the younger sherry to the proper proportions . this two-stage procedure is performed so the strong alcohol will not shock the young sherry and spoil it .
