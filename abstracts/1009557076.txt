a nuclear family , elementary family or conjugal family is a family group consisting of two parents and their children ( one or more ) . it is in contrast to a single-parent family , the larger extended family , or a family with more than two parents . nuclear families typically center on a married couple which may have any number of children . there are differences in definition among observers . some definitions allow only biological children that are full-blood siblings and consider adopted or half and step siblings a part of the immediate family , but others allow for a stepparent and any mix of dependent children including stepchildren and adopted children . some sociologists and anthropologists consider the nuclear family as the most basic form of social organization . although the term nuclear family was popularized in the 20th century , it has been the dominant form of family structure for centuries in europe .
