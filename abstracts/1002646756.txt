the foss dyke , or fossdyke , connects the river trent at torksey to lincoln , the county town of lincolnshire , and may be the oldest canal in england that is still in use . it is usually thought to have been built around ad & nbsp ; 120 by the romans , but there is no consensus among authors . it was refurbished in 1121 , during the reign of king henry i , and responsibility for its maintenance was transferred to the city of lincoln by king james i . improvements made in 1671 included a navigable sluice or lock at torksey , and warehousing and wharves were built at brayford pool in the centre of lincoln . connection to the river witham at brayford was hampered by the small bore and depth of high bridge , a medieval structure just below the pool . the channel through it was made deeper in 1795 , but john rennie 's plans to demolish it in 1803 were not adopted . the canal was leased to several generations of the ellison family , who profited from the tolls but failed to maintain it . although cargoes of coal and wool moved to the railway , the carriage of grain continued , and the last commercial operation was in 1972 . the brayford mere trust have turned brayford pool into a marina , and the lincolnshire waterways partnership are opening a footpath and cycleway from lincoln to torksey ; the section to saxilby was officially opened on 26 july 2011 .
