in christian theology , merit ( latin : meritum ) is a good work done that is '' seen to have a claim to a future reward from a graceful god '' . the role of human merit in christian life is a point of dispute between catholics and protestants . within christianity , both catholics and lutherans affirm that '' by grace alone , in faith in christ 's saving work and not because of any merit on our part , we are accepted by god and receive the holy spirit , who renews our hearts while equipping and calling us to good works '' . the catholic church further teaches that '' when catholics affirm the 'meritorious ' character of good works , they wish to say that , according to the biblical witness , a reward in heaven is promised to these works . their intention is to emphasize the responsibility of persons for their actions , not to contest the character of those works as gifts , or far less to deny that justification always remains the unmerited gift of grace '' . roman catholicism '' speaks of merit in three distinct ways '' : condign merit ( which god crowns freely ) , congruous merit ( nonobligatory reward that may result in sanctification ) , and supererogation ( given for doing above what a christian is required ) . reformed doctrine , on the other hand , puts more emphasis on the merit of christ that humans receive through divine grace . protestants generally teach that merit can never be used to earn or achieve salvation : '' because christians are justified by faith alone , their standing before god is not in any way related to personal merit . good works and practical holiness do not provide the grounds for acceptance with god . '' '' the only merit god accepts for salvation is that of jesus christ ; nothing man can ever do could earn god â€™ s favor or add anything to the merit of christ . ''
