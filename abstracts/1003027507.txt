the coandă-1910 , designed by romanian inventor henri coandă , was an unconventional sesquiplane aircraft powered by a ducted fan . called the '' turbo-propulseur '' by coandă , its experimental engine consisted of a conventional piston engine driving a multi-bladed centrifugal blower which exhausted into a duct . the unusual aircraft attracted attention at the paris air show in paris in october 1910 , being the only exhibit without a propeller , but the aircraft was not displayed afterwards and it fell from public awareness . coandă used a similar turbo-propulseur to drive a snow sledge , but he did not develop it further for aircraft . decades later , after the practical demonstration of motorjets and turbojets , coandă began to tell various conflicting stories about how his early experiments were precursors to the jet , even that his turbo-propulseur was the first motorjet engine with fuel combustion in the airstream . he also claimed to have made a single brief flight in december 1910 , crashing just after takeoff , the aircraft being destroyed by fire . two aviation historians countered coandă 's version of events , saying there was no proof that the engine had combustion in the airstream , and no proof that the aircraft ever flew . in 1965 , coandă brought drawings forward to prove his claim of combustion ducting but these were shown to be reworked , differing substantially from the originals . some british aviation historians were dismissive , saying that coandă 's turbo-propulseur design involved a weak stream of '' plain air '' , not a powerful jet of air expanding from fuel combustion . in 2010 , based on the notion that coandă invented the first jet , the centennial of the jet aircraft was celebrated in romania . a special coin and stamp were issued , and construction began on a working replica of the aircraft . at the european parliament , an exhibition commemorated the building and testing of the coandă-1910 .
