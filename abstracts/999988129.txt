beech ( fagus ) is a genus of deciduous trees in the family fagaceae , native to temperate europe , asia , and north america . recent classifications recognize 10 to 13 species in two distinct subgenera , engleriana and fagus . the engleriana subgenus is found only in east asia , distinctive for their low branches , often made up of several major trunks with yellowish bark . the better known fagus subgenus beeches are high-branching with tall , stout trunks and smooth silver-grey bark . the european beech ( fagus sylvatica ) is the most commonly cultivated . beeches are monoecious , bearing both male and female flowers on the same plant . the small flowers are unisexual , the female flowers borne in pairs , the male flowers wind-pollinating catkins . they are produced in spring shortly after the new leaves appear . the fruit of the beech tree , known as beechnuts or mast , is found in small burrs that drop from the tree in autumn . they are small , roughly triangular and edible , with a bitter , astringent , or mild and nut-like taste . the european species fagus sylvatica yields a utility timber that is tough but dimensionally unstable . it is widely used for furniture framing and carcase construction , flooring and engineering purposes , in plywood and in household items like plates , but rarely as a decorative wood . the timber can be used to build chalets , houses , and log cabins . beech wood also makes excellent firewood , easily split and burning for many hours with bright but calm flames . slats of washed beech wood are spread around the bottom of fermentation tanks for budweiser ( anheuser-busch ) beer . beech logs are burned to dry the malt used in some german smoked beers . beech is also used to smoke westphalian ham , andouille sausage , and some cheeses .
