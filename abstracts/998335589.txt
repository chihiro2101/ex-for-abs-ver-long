total information awareness ( tia ) was a mass detection program by the united states information awareness office . it operated under this title from february to may 2003 before being renamed terrorism information awareness . based on the concept of predictive policing , tia was meant to correlate detailed information about people in order to anticipate and prevent terrorist incidents before execution . the program modeled specific information sets in the hunt for terrorists around the globe . admiral john poindexter called it a '' manhattan project for counter-terrorism '' . according to senator ron wyden , tia was the '' biggest surveillance program in the history of the united states '' . congress defunded the information awareness office in late 2003 after media reports criticized the government for attempting to establish '' total information awareness '' over all citizens . although the program was formally suspended , other government agencies later adopted some of its software with only superficial changes . tia 's core architecture continued development under the code name '' basketball . '' according to a 2012 new york times article , tia 's legacy was '' quietly thriving '' at the national security agency ( nsa ) .
