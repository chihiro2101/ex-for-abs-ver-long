william kempe ( c . 1560â€“c . 1603 ) , commonly referred to as will kemp , was an english actor and dancer specialising in comic roles and best known for having been one of the original players in early dramas by william shakespeare . roles associated with his name may include the great comic creation , falstaff , and his contemporaries considered him the successor to the great clown of the previous generation , richard tarlton . kempe 's success and influence was such that in december 1598 he was one of a core of five actor-shareholders in the lord chamberlain 's men alongside shakespeare and richard burbage , but in a short time ( possibly after a disagreement among the members of the troupe ) he parted company with the group . despite his fame as a performer and subsequent intent to continue his career , he appears to have died unregarded and in poverty circa 1603 .
