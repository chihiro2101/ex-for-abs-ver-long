degenerate art was a term adopted in the 1920s by the nazi party in germany to describe modern art . during the dictatorship of adolf hitler , german modernist art , including many works of internationally renowned artists , was removed from state-owned museums and banned in nazi germany on the grounds that such art was an '' insult to german feeling '' , un-german , jewish , or communist in nature . those identified as degenerate artists were subjected to sanctions that included being dismissed from teaching positions , being forbidden to exhibit or to sell their art , and in some cases being forbidden to produce art . degenerate art also was the title of an exhibition , held by the nazis in munich in 1937 , consisting of 650 modernist artworks chaotically hung and accompanied by text labels deriding the art . designed to inflame public opinion against modernism , the exhibition subsequently traveled to several other cities in germany and austria . while modern styles of art were prohibited , the nazis promoted paintings and sculptures that were traditional in manner and that exalted the '' blood and soil '' values of racial purity , militarism , and obedience . similar restrictions were placed upon music , which was expected to be tonal and free of any jazz influences ; disapproved music was termed degenerate music . films and plays were also censored .
