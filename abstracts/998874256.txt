the christian music industry is a small part of the larger music industry , that focuses on traditional gospel music , southern gospel , contemporary christian music , and alternative christian music . it is sometimes called the gospel music industry , although this designation is not a limitation on the musical styles represented . christian artists generally use secular styles , pairing them with lyrics that display faith and spirituality to varying degrees . generally speaking , the industry is influenced by mainstream culture . musical trends , for instance , follow those of the secular scene , though usually a few years behind . quote : '' of course the christian market was a few years behind the rest of the world . it always is . '' original emphasis the christian music industry carries the distinction of being the only music subculture whose content is labeled by its lyrical dimension rather than its music . still , music within the industry is sold by its musical style rather than lyrical content . christian music 's critics point to the divergent interests of commercialization and ministry , which have , according to some , polar opposite goals . aspects of christian music have long struggled to gain general acceptance , even within the christian community . what some see as secularization and a lacking of direct theology , others see as artistic ministry . this opens up questions of the definition of '' christian music '' that have lingered over the industry since its inception . the christian music industry experienced tremendous growth in the 1990s . christian music sales grew to exceed those for classical , jazz , and new age music . even so , the christian music industry has experienced the same issues as the general market in recent years .
