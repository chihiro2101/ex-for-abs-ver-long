mains electricity ( commonwealth english ) , also known by the american english terms utility power , power grid , domestic power , and wall power , or in some parts of canada as hydro , is a general-purpose alternating current ( ac ) electric power supply . it is the form of electrical power that is delivered to homes and businesses through electric grid in many parts of the world . people use this electricity to power everyday items—such as domestic appliances , televisions and lamps—by plugging them into a wall outlet . the two principal properties of the electric power supply , voltage and frequency , differ between regions . a voltage of ( nominally ) 230 & nbsp ; v and a frequency of 50 & nbsp ; hz is used in europe , most of africa , most of asia , australia , and much of south america . in north america , the most common combination is 120 & nbsp ; v and a frequency of 60 & nbsp ; hz . other voltages exist , and some countries may have , for example , 230 & nbsp ; v at 60 & nbsp ; hz . this is a concern to travellers , since portable appliances designed for one voltage and frequency combination may not operate with , or may even be destroyed by another . the use of different and incompatible plugs and sockets in different regions and countries provides some protection from accidental use of appliances with incompatible voltage and frequency requirements .
