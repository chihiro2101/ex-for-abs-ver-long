a cepheid variable is a type of star that instability strip , varying in both diameter and temperature and producing changes in brightness with a well-defined stable period and amplitude . a strong direct relationship between a cepheid variable 's luminosity and pulsation period established cepheids as important indicators of cosmic benchmarks for scaling cosmic distance ladder . this robust characteristic of classical cepheids was discovered in 1908 by henrietta swan leavitt after studying thousands of variable stars in the magellanic clouds . this discovery allows one to know the true luminosity of a cepheid by simply observing its pulsation period . this in turn allows one to determine the distance to the star , by comparing its known luminosity to its observed brightness . the term cepheid originates from delta cephei in the constellation cepheus , identified by john goodricke in 1784 , the first of its type to be so identified . the mechanics of the pulsation as a heat-engine was proposed in 1917 by arthur stanley eddington ( who wrote at length on the dynamics of cepheids ) , but it was not until 1953 that s . a . zhevakin identified ionized helium as a likely valve for the engine .
