isotope analysis is the identification of isotopic signature , the abundance of certain stable isotopes and chemical elements within organic and inorganic compounds . isotopic analysis can be used to understand the flow of energy through a food web , to reconstruct past environmental and climatic conditions , to investigate human and animal diets in the past , for food authentification , and a variety of other physical , geological , palaeontological and chemical processes . stable isotope ratios are measured using mass spectrometry , which separates the different isotopes of an element on the basis of their mass-to-charge ratio .
