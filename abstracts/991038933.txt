the human skeleton is the internal framework of the human body . it is composed of around 270 bones at birth â€“ this total decreases to around 206 bones by adulthood after some bones get fused together . the bone mass in the skeleton reaches maximum density around age 21 . the human skeleton can be divided into the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton . the axial skeleton is formed by the vertebral column , the rib cage , the skull and other associated bones . the appendicular skeleton , which is attached to the axial skeleton , is formed by the shoulder girdle , the pelvic girdle and the bones of the upper and lower limbs . the human skeleton performs six major functions : support , movement , protection , production of blood cells , storage of minerals , and endocrine regulation . the human skeleton is not as sexual dimorphism as that of many other primate species , but subtle differences between sexes in the morphology of the skull , dentition , long bones , and pelvis exist . in general , female skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust than corresponding male elements within a given population . the human female pelvis is also different from that of males in order to facilitate childbirth . thieme atlas of anatomy , ( 2006 ) , p 113 unlike most primates , human males do not have penile bones . patterns of sexual behavior clellan s . ford and frank a . beach , published by harper & row , new york in 1951 .
