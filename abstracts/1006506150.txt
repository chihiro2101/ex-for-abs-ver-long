a crosier ( also known as a crozier , paterissa , pastoral staff , or bishop 's staff ) is a stylized staff that is a symbol of the governing office of a bishop or apostle and is carried by high-ranking prelates of roman catholic , eastern catholic , eastern orthodox , oriental orthodox , anglican , and some lutheran , united methodist and pentecostal churches . in western christianity the usual form has been a shepherd 's crook , curved at the top to enable animals to be hooked . in eastern christianity , it is found in two common forms : tau-shaped , with curved arms , surmounted by a small cross ; or a pair of sculptured serpents or dragons curled back to face each other , with a small cross between them . other typical insignia of prelates are the mitre , the pectoral cross , and the episcopal ring .
