melanie klein ( née reizes ) ( 30 march 1882 – 22 september 1960 ) was an austrian-british author and psychoanalyst known for her work in child analysis . she was the primary figure in the development of object relations theory . klein suggested that pre-verbal existential anxiety in infancy catalyzed the formation of the unconscious , resulting in the unconscious splitting of the world into good and bad idealizations . in her theory , how the child resolves that split depends on the constitution of the child and the character of nurturing the child experiences ; the quality of resolution can inform the presence , absence , and/or type of distresses a person experiences later in life . r . d . hinshelwood : clinical klein , basic books , 2003 ,
