george antheil ; july 8 , 1900 – february 12 , 1959 ) was an american avant-garde composer , pianist , author , and inventor whose modernist musical compositions explored the modern sounds – musical , industrial , and mechanical – of the early 20th century . spending much of the 1920s in europe , antheil returned to the us in the 1930s , and thereafter spent much of his time composing music for films , and eventually , television . as a result of this work , his style became more tonal . a man of diverse interests and talents , antheil was constantly reinventing himself . he wrote magazine articles ( one accurately predicted the development and outcome of world war ii ) , an autobiography , a mystery novel , and newspaper and music columns . in 1941 , antheil and the actress hedy lamarr developed a radio guidance system for allied torpedoes that used a code ( stored on a punched paper tape ) to synchronise random frequencies , referred to as frequency hopping , between a receiver and transmitter . it is one of the techniques now known as spread spectrum , widely used in telecommunications . this work led to their being inducted into the national inventors hall of fame in 2014 .
