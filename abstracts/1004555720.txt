hyper-threading ( officially called hyper-threading technology or ht technology and abbreviated as htt or ht ) is intel 's proprietary simultaneous multithreading ( smt ) implementation used to improve parallel computation ( doing multiple tasks at once ) performed on x86 microprocessors . it was introduced on xeon server processors in february 2002 and on pentium & nbsp ; 4 desktop processors in november 2002 . since then , intel has included this technology in itanium , atom , and intel core cpus , among others . for each processor core that is physically present , the operating system addresses two virtual ( logical ) cores and shares the workload between them when possible . the main function of hyper-threading is to increase the number of independent instructions in the pipeline ; it takes advantage of superscalar architecture , in which multiple instructions operate on separate data in parallel . with htt , one physical core appears as two processors to the operating system , allowing concurrent scheduling of two processes per core . in addition , two or more processes can use the same resources : if resources for one process are not available , then another process can continue if its resources are available . in addition to requiring simultaneous multithreading support in the operating system , hyper-threading can be properly utilized only with an operating system specifically optimized for it . intel required components interchangeability list for the intel pentium & nbsp ; 4 processor with ht technology , includes list of operating systems that include optimizations for hyper-threading technology ; they are windows xp professional & nbsp ; 64 , windows xp mce , windows xp home , windows xp professional , some versions of linux such as cosix linux & nbsp ; 4.0 , redhat linux & nbsp ; 9 ( professional and personal versions ) , redflag linux desktop & nbsp ; 4.0 and suse linux & nbsp ; 8.2 ( professional and personal versions )
