sir arthur wing pinero ( 24 may 185523 november 1934 ) was an english playwright and , early in his career , actor . pinero was drawn to the theatre from an early age , and became a professional actor at the age of 19 . he gained experience as a supporting actor in british provincial theatres , and from 1876 to 1881 was a member of henry irving 's company , based at the lyceum theatre , london . pinero wrote his first play in 1877 . seven years later , having written 15 more , three of them highly successful , he abandoned acting and became a full-time playwright . he first became known for a series of farces , of which the magistrate ( 1885 ) was the longest-running . during the 1890s he turned to serious subjects . the second mrs tanqueray ( 1893 ) , dealing with a woman with a scandalous past , was regarded as shocking , but ran well and made a large profit . his other successes included trelawny of the 'wells ' ( 1898 ) , a romantic comedy celebrating the theatre , old and new , and the gay lord quex , about a reformed rou√© and a feisty young woman . a venture into opera , with a libretto for the beauty stone ( 1898 ) , was not a success , and pinero thereafter generally stuck to his familiar genre of society dramas and comedies . although he continued to write throughout the first three decades of the 20th century and into the fourth , it is pinero 's work from the 1880s and 1890s that has endured . there have been numerous revivals of many of his plays ; and some have been adapted for the cinema or as musicals . by his later years , pinero was seen as old-fashioned , and his last plays were not successful . he died in london at the age of 79 .
