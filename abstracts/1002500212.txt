a by-election , also spelled bye-election , and also known as a special election ( united states , the philippines ) or a bypoll ( india ) , is an election used to fill an office that has become vacant between general elections . in most cases these elections occur after the incumbent dies or resigns , but they also occur when the incumbent becomes ineligible to continue in office ( because of a recall , nobility , criminal conviction , or failure to maintain a call of the house ) . less commonly , these elections have been called when a constituency election is invalidated by voting irregularities .
