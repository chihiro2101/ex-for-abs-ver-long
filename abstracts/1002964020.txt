ex situ conservation literally means , '' off-site conservation '' . it is the process of protecting an endangered species , variety or breed , of plant or animal outside its natural habitat ; for example , by removing part of the population from a threatened habitat and placing it in a new location , an artificial environment which is similar to the natural habitat of the respective animal and within the care of humans , example are zoological parks and wildlife safaris . the degree to which humans control or modify the natural dynamics of the managed population varies widely , and this may include alteration of living environments , reproductive patterns , access to resources , and protection from predation and mortality . ex situ management can occur within or outside a species ' natural geographic range . individuals maintained ex situ exist outside an niche ( ecology ) . this means that they are not under the same selection pressures as wild populations , and they may undergo selective breeding if maintained ex situ for multiple generations . crop diversity is also conserved in ex situ collections . this is primarily in the form of gene banks where samples are stored in order to conserve the genetic resources of major crop plants and their wild relatives .
