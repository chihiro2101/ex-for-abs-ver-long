the ultimate fate of the universe is a topic in physical cosmology , whose theoretical restrictions allow possible scenarios for the evolution and ultimate fate of the universe to be described and evaluated . based on available observational evidence , deciding the fate and evolution of the universe has become a valid cosmological question , being beyond the mostly untestable constraints of mythological or theological beliefs . several possible futures have been predicted by different scientific hypotheses , including that the universe might have existed for a finite and infinite duration , or towards explaining the manner and circumstances of its beginning . observations made by edwin hubble during the 1920s–1950s found that galaxies appeared to be moving away from each other , leading to the currently accepted big bang theory . this suggests that the universe began – very small and very dense – about age of universe ago , and it has expanded and ( on average ) become less dense ever since . confirmation of the big bang mostly depends on knowing the rate of expansion , average density of matter , and the physical properties of the mass–energy in the universe . there is a strong consensus among cosmologists that the universe is considered '' flat '' ( see shape of the universe ) and will continue to expand forever . factors that need to be considered in determining the universe 's origin and ultimate fate include the average motions of galaxies , the shape and structure of the universe , and the amount of dark matter and dark energy that the universe contains .
