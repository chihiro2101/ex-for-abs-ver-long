in aeronautics , the fuselage ; from the french fusel√© '' spindle-shaped '' ) is an aircraft 's main body section . it holds crew , passengers , and cargo . in single-engine aircraft , it will usually contain an engine , as well , although in some amphibious aircraft the single engine is mounted on a pylon attached to the fuselage , which in turn is used as a floating hull . the fuselage also serves to position the control and stabilization surfaces in specific relationships to surface lift , which is required for aircraft stability and maneuverability .
