the aerospike engine is a type of rocket engine that maintains its aerodynamic efficiency across a wide range of altitudes . it belongs to the class of altitude compensating nozzle engines . a vehicle with an aerospike engine uses 25–30 % less fuel at low altitudes , where most missions have the greatest need for thrust . aerospike engines have been studied for a number of years and are the baseline engines for many single-stage-to-orbit ( ssto ) designs and were also a strong contender for the space shuttle main engine . however , no such engine is in commercial production , although some large-scale aerospikes are in testing phases . the terminology in the literature surrounding this subject is somewhat confused—the term aerospike was originally used for a truncated plug nozzle with a very rough conical taper and some gas injection , forming an '' air spike '' to help make up for the absence of the plug tail . however , frequently , a full-length plug nozzle is now called an aerospike .
