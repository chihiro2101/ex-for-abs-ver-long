the western blot ( sometimes called the protein immunoblot ) , or western blotting , is a widely used analytical technique in molecular biology and immunogenetics to detect specific proteins in a sample of tissue homogenate or extract . in brief , the sample undergoes protein denaturation , followed by gel electrophoresis . a synthetic or animal-derived antibody ( known as the primary antibody ) is created that recognises and binds to a specific target protein . the electrophoresis membrane is washed in a solution containing the primary antibody , before excess antibody is washed off . a secondary antibody is added which recognises and binds to the primary antibody . the secondary antibody is visualised through various methods such as staining , immunofluorescence , and radioactivity , allowing indirect detection of the specific target protein . other related techniques include dot blot analysis , quantitative dot blot , immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry , where antibodies are used to detect proteins in tissues and cells by immunostaining , and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) . the name western blot is a play on the southern blot , a technique for dna detection named after its inventor , english biologist edwin southern . similarly , detection of rna is termed as northern blot . the term '' western blot '' was given by w . neal burnette in 1981 , although the method itself originated in 1979 in the laboratory of harry towbin at the friedrich miescher institute in basel , switzerland . between 1979 and 2019 '' it has been mentioned in the titles , abstracts , and keywords of more than 400,000 pubmed-listed publications '' and may still be the most used protein-analytical technique .
