because of this , political opponents were few and far between . near the end of this presidency , he declared that he would remove the state of siege , but quickly recanted after students began protesting trolley fares . for the first 13 years of his rule , stroessner ruled under a severely authoritarian constitution enacted in 1940 . it was replaced in 1967 with an equally repressive document . like its predecessor , it gave the president broad powers to take exceptional actions for the good of the country , such as suspending civil liberties and intervening in the economy . it thus formed the legal basis for the state of virtual martial law under which stroessner governed . while it limited the president to two five-year terms , it stipulated that only those terms completed after the 1968 election would count toward that limit . in 1977 , faced with having to leave office for good the following year , stroessner pushed through a constitutional amendment allowing him to run for an unlimited number of five-year terms .
