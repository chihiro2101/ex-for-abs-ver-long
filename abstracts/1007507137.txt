the great bible of 1539 was the first authorised edition of the bible in english , authorised by king henry viii of england to be read aloud in the church services of the church of england . the great bible was prepared by myles coverdale , working under commission of thomas cromwell , secretary to henry viii and vicar general . in 1538 , cromwell directed the clergy to provide '' one book of the bible of the largest volume in english , and the same set up in some convenient place within the said church that ye have care of , whereas your parishioners may most commodiously resort to the same and read it . '' the great bible includes much from the tyndale bible , with the objectionable features revised . as the tyndale bible was incomplete , coverdale translated the remaining books of the old testament and apocrypha from the latin vulgate and german translations , rather than working from the original greek , hebrew and aramaic texts . although called the great bible because of its large size , it is known by several other names as well : the cromwell bible , since thomas cromwell directed its publication ; whitchurch 's bible after its first english printer ; the chained bible , since it was chained to prevent removal from the church . it has less accurately been termed cranmer 's bible , since although thomas cranmer was not responsible for the translation , a preface by him appeared in the second edition . .
