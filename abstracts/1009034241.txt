little orphan annie is a daily american comic strip created by harold gray and syndicated by the tribune media services . the strip took its name from the 1885 poem '' little orphant annie '' by james whitcomb riley , and made its debut on august 5 , 1924 , in the new york daily news . the plot follows the wide-ranging adventures of annie , her dog sandy and her benefactor oliver '' daddy '' warbucks . secondary characters include punjab , the asp and mr . am . the strip attracted adult readers with political commentary that targeted ( among other things ) organized labor , the new deal and communism . following gray 's death in 1968 , several artists drew the strip and , for a time , '' classic '' strips were reruns . little orphan annie inspired a radio show in 1930 , film adaptations by rko in 1932 and paramount in 1938 and a broadway musical annie in 1977 ( which was adapted into a film of the same name three times , one in 1982 , one in 1999 and another in 2014 ) . the strip 's popularity declined over the years ; it was running in only 20 newspapers when it was cancelled on june 13 , 2010 . the characters now appear occasionally as supporting ones in dick tracy .
