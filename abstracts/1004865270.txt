boranes is the name given to the class of synthetic hydrides of boron with generic formula b x h y . in the past , borane molecules were often labeled '' electron-deficient '' because of their multicenter bonding ( in which a pair of bonding electrons links more than two atoms , as in 3-center-2-electron bonds ) ; this was done in order to distinguish such molecules from hydrocarbons and other classically bonded compounds . however , this usage is incorrect , as most boranes and related clusters such as carboranes are actually electron-precise , not electron-deficient . for example , the extremely stable icosahedral b 12 h 12 2− dianion , whose 26 cluster valence electrons exactly fill the 13 bonding molecular orbitals , is in no actual sense deficient in electrons ; indeed it is thermodynamically far more stable than benzene . 1 r . n . grimes ( 2016 ) carboranes 3rd edition , elsevier , new york and amsterdam , pp . 16-17 . while some boranes are highly reactive with respect to electron-pair donors , others are not , e.g . , the b n h n 2− dianions ( n 6-12 ) as well as many neutral boranes such as b 18 h 22 . some lower boranes are pyrophoric in air and react with water . the boranes belong to the class of cluster compounds , which have been the subject of developments in chemical bond . many of the related anionic hydridoborates have also been synthesized .
