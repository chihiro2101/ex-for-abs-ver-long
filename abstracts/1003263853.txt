simon says ( or simple simon says ) is a children 's game for three or more players . one player takes the role of '' simon '' and issues instructions ( usually physical actions such as '' jump in the air '' or '' stick out your tongue '' ) to the other players , which should be followed only when prefaced with the phrase '' simon says '' . players are eliminated from the game by either following instructions that are not immediately preceded by the phrase , or by failing to follow an instruction which does include the phrase '' simon says '' . it is the ability to distinguish between genuine and fake commands , rather than physical ability , that usually matters in the game ; in most cases , the action just needs to be attempted . in many regions of the united states , “ simon says ” is also known as '' simon sez '' . the object for the player acting as simon is to get all the other players out as quickly as possible ; the winner of the game is usually the last player who has successfully followed all of the given commands . occasionally , however , two or more of the last players may all be eliminated at the same time , thus resulting in simon winning the game . the game is embedded in popular culture , with numerous references in films , music , and literature .
