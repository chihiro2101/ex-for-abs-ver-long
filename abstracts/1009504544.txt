the fieldfare ( turdus pilaris ) is a member of the thrush family turdidae . it breeds in woodland and scrub in northern europe and across the palearctic . it is strongly migratory , with many northern birds moving south during the winter . it is a very rare breeder in the british isles , but winters in large numbers in the united kingdom , southern europe , north africa and the middle east . it is omnivorous , eating a wide range of molluscs , insects and earthworms in the summer , and berries , grain and seeds in the winter . fieldfares often nest in small colonies , possibly for protection from predation . the nest is built in a tree where five or six eggs are laid . the chicks are fed by both parents and leave the nest after a fortnight . there may be two broods in southern parts of the range but only one further north . migrating birds and wintering birds often form large flocks , often in the company of redwings . the fieldfare is long , with a grey crown , neck and rump , a plain brown back , dark wings and tail and white underwings . the breast and flanks are heavily spotted . the breast has a reddish wash and the rest of the underparts are white . the sexes are similar in appearance but the females are slightly more brown . the male has a simple chattering song and the birds have various guttural flight and alarm calls .
