tempest ( telecommunications electronics materials protected from emanating spurious transmissions ) is a u.s . national security agency specification and a nato certification referring to spying on information systems through leaking emanations , including unintentional radio or electrical signals , sounds , and vibrations . tempest covers both methods to spy upon others and how to shield equipment against such spying . the protection efforts are also known as emission security ( emsec ) , which is a subset of communications security ( comsec ) . the nsa methods for spying on computer emissions are classified , but some of the protection standards have been released by either the nsa or the department of defense . protecting equipment from spying is done with distance , shielding , filtering , and masking . the tempest standards mandate elements such as equipment distance from walls , amount of shielding in buildings and equipment , and distance separating wires carrying classified vs . unclassified materials , filters on cables , and even distance and shielding between wires or equipment and building pipes . noise can also protect information by masking the actual data . while much of tempest is about van eck phreaking , it also encompasses sounds and mechanical vibrations . for example , it is possible to log a user 's keystrokes using the accelerometer inside smartphones . compromising emissions are defined as unintentional information-bearing signals which , if intercepted and analyzed ( side-channel attack ) , may disclose the information transmitted , received , handled , or otherwise processed by any information-processing equipment .
