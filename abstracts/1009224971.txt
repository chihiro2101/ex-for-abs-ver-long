forcetoc__ susanoo ( スサノオ ; historical orthography : スサノヲ , susanowo ) is a kami in japanese mythology . the younger brother of amaterasu , goddess of the sun and mythical ancestress of the japanese imperial line , he is a multifaceted deity with contradictory characteristics ( both good and bad ) , being portrayed in various stories either as a wild , impetuous god associated with the sea and storms , as a heroic figure who killed a monstrous serpent , or as a local deity linked with the harvest and agriculture . shinbutsu shūgō that arose after the introduction of buddhism to japan also saw susanoo becoming conflated with deities of pestilence and disease . susanoo , alongside amaterasu and the earthly kami ōkuninushi ( also ōnamuchi ) – who , depending on the source , is depicted as being either susanoo 's son or descendant – is one of the central deities of the imperial japanese mythological cycle recorded in the kojiki ( ca . 712 ce ) and the nihon shoki ( 720 ce ) . one of the gazetteer reports ( fudoki ) commissioned by the imperial court during the same period these texts were written , that of izumo province ( modern shimane prefecture ) in western japan , also contains a number of short legends concerning susanoo or his children , suggesting a connection between the god and this region . in addition , a few other myths also hint at a connection between susanoo and the korean peninsula .
