computer-aided manufacturing ( cam ) also known as computer-aided modeling or computer-aided machining is the use of software to control machine tools and related ones in the manufacturing of work pieces . this is not the only definition for cam , but it is the most common ; cam may also refer to the use of a computer to assist in all operations of a manufacturing plant , including planning , management , transportation and storage . its primary purpose is to create a faster production process and components and tooling with more precise dimensions and material consistency , which in some cases , uses only the required amount of raw material ( thus minimizing waste ) , while simultaneously reducing energy consumption . cam is now a system used in schools and lower educational purposes . cam is a subsequent computer-aided process after computer-aided design ( cad ) and sometimes computer-aided engineering ( cae ) , as the model generated in cad and verified in cae can be input into cam software , which then controls the machine tool . cam is used in many schools alongside computer-aided design ( cad ) to create objects .
