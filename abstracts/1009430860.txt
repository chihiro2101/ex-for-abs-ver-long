robert burnell ( sometimes spelled robert burnel ; harding england in the thirteenth century p . 159 c . 1239 & nbsp ; – 25 october 1292 ) was an english bishop who served as lord chancellor of england from 1274 to 1292 . a native of shropshire , he served as a minor royal official before entering into the service of prince edward , the future king edward i of england . when edward went on the eighth crusade in 1270 , burnell stayed in england to secure the prince 's interests . he served as regent after the death of king henry iii of england while edward was still on crusade . he was twice elected archbishop of canterbury , but his personal life—which included a long-term mistress who was rumoured to have borne him four sons—prevented his confirmation by the papacy . in 1275 burnell was elected bishop of bath and wells , after edward had appointed him lord chancellor in 1274 . burnell was behind the efforts of the royal officials to enforce royal rights during his term of office as chancellor , including the implementation of the quo warranto procedures . he also helped with the legislative and legal reforms of edward 's reign . during burnell 's tenure the chancellor 's office and records became fixed in london rather than travelling with the king . burnell went abroad on diplomatic missions for edward , and for a time governed gascony . he continued to enjoy the king 's trust until his death in 1292 ; one historian has suggested that burnell may have been the most important royal official of the 13th century .
