the history of group dynamics ( or group processes ) has a consistent , underlying premise : 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts ' a social group is an entity that has qualities which can not be understood just by studying the individuals that make up the group ( the proposition remains questionable , since modern biologists and game theorists do look to explain the 'structural laws of the whole ' in terms of 'the way the elements fit together ' ( the concept of a collective consciousness is not essential to group dynamics eventually , the social psychology kurt lewin ( 1890–1947 ) coined the term group dynamics to describe the positive and negative forces within groups of people in 1945 , he established the group dynamics research center at the massachusetts institute of technology , the first institute devoted explicitly to the study of group dynamics throughout his career , lewin was focused on how the study of group dynamics could be applied to real-world , social issues increasingly , research has applied evolutionary psychology principles to group dynamics as humans social environments became more complex , they acquired adaptations by way of group dynamics that enhance survival examples include mechanisms for dealing with status , reciprocity , identifying cheaters , ostracism , altruism , group decision , leadership , and intergroup relations gustave le bon was a french social psychologist whose seminal study , the crowd : a study of the popular mind ( 1896 ) led to the development of group psychology the british psychologist william mcdougall in his work the group mind ( 1920 ) researched the dynamics of groups of various sizes and degrees of organization moreno was a psychiatrist , dramatist , philosopher and theoretician who coined the term '' group psychotherapy '' in the early 1930s and was highly influential at the time kurt lewin ( 1943 , 1948 , 1951 ) is commonly identified as the founder of the movement to study groups scientifically william schutz ( 1958 , 1966 ) looked at interpersonal relations as stage-developmental , inclusion ( am i included ? ) , control ( who is top dog here ? ) , and affection ( do i belong here ? ) he discovered several mass group processes which involved the group as a whole adopting an orientation which , in his opinion , interfered with the ability of a group to accomplish the work it was nominally engaged in yalom , the theory and practice of group psychotherapy , third edition , basic books ( 1985 ) , hardback , bion 's experiences are reported in his published books , especially experiences in groups this model refers to the overall pattern of the group , but of course individuals within a group work in different ways if distrust persists , a group may never even get to the norming stage richard hackman developed a synthetic , research-based model for designing and managing work groups these include : being a real team : which results from having a shared task , clear boundaries which clarify who is inside or outside of the group , and stability in group membership compelling direction : which results from a clear , challenging , and consequential goal enabling structure : which results from having tasks which have variety , a group size that is not too large , talented group members who have at least moderate social skill , and strong norms that specify appropriate behaviour in companies , supportive contexts involves a ) reward systems that reward performance and cooperation ( e.g intragroup dynamics ( also referred to as ingroup- , within-group , or commonly just ‘ group dynamics ’ ) are the underlying processes that give rise to a set of norms , roles , relations , and common goals that characterize a particular social group examples of groups include religious , political , military , and environmental groups , sports teams , work groups , and therapy groups in many fields of research , there is an interest in understanding how group dynamics influence individual behaviour , attitudes , and opinions the dynamics of a particular group depend on how one defines the boundaries of the group residents ( ‘ americans ’ ) as a group , but could also define a more specific set of u.s for example , there are group dynamics in the u.s group formation starts with a psychological bond between individuals additionally , from the social identity approach , group formation involves both identifying with some individuals and explicitly not identifying with others through interaction , individuals begin to develop group norms , roles , and attitudes which define the group , and are internalized to influence behaviour it also offers friendship , potential new interests , learning new skills , and enhancing self esteem however , joining a group may also cost an individual time , effort , and personal resources as they may conform to social pressures and strive to reap the benefits that may be offered by the group however , this does not necessarily mean that a person will join a group simply because the reward/cost ratio seems attractive according to the social exchange theory , group membership will be more satisfying to a new prospective member if the group 's outcomes , in terms of costs and rewards , are above the individual 's comparison level as well , group membership will be unsatisfying to a new member if the outcomes are below the individual 's comparison level to summarize , if membership in the group is above the comparison level for alternatives and above the comparison level , the membership within the group will be satisfying and an individual will be more likely to join the group if membership in the group is above the comparison level for alternatives but below the comparison level , membership will be not be satisfactory ; however , the individual will likely join the group since no other desirable options are available when group membership is below the comparison level for alternatives but above the comparison level , membership is satisfying but an individual will be unlikely to join it was found that participants consistently sorted groups into four categories : intimacy groups , task groups , loose associations , and social categories individuals that are a part of primary groups consider the group to be an important part of their lives examples of primary groups include family , close friends , and gangs collectives are characterized by large groups of individuals who display similar actions or outlooks entitativity is defined by campbell as the extent to which collections of individuals are perceived to be a group the degree of entitativity that a group has is influenced by whether a collection of individuals experience the same fate , display similarities , and are close in proximity an individual 's identity ( or self-concept ) has two components : personal identity and social identity ( or collective self ) in this way , these comparisons give us a distinct and valued social identity that benefits our self-esteem our social identity and group membership also satisfies a need to belong therefore , one 's social identity can have several , qualitatively distinct parts ( for example , one 's ethnic identity , religious identity , and political identity ) that is , to be similar to others ( those who you share group membership with ) , but also to be different from others ( those who are outside of your group ) terms such as attraction , solidarity , and morale are often used to describe group cohesion it is thought to be one of the most important characteristics of a group , and has been linked to group performance , group conflict and therapeutic change lewin defined group cohesion as the willingness of individuals to stick together , and believed that without cohesiveness a group could not exist later , this definition was modified to describe the forces acting on individual members to remain in the group , termed attraction to the group individuals tend to upgrade likeable in-group members and deviate from unlikeable group members , making them a separate outgroup according to this theory , people derogate socially undesirable ( deviant ) ingroup members relative to outgroup members , because they give a bad image of the ingroup and jeopardize people 's social identity whereas new members of a group must prove themselves to the full members to become accepted , full members have undergone socialization and are already accepted within the group marginal members were once full members but lost membership because they failed to live up to the group 's expectations they can rejoin the group if they go through re-socialization prescriptive norms : the socially appropriate way to respond in a social situation , or what group members are supposed to do ( e.g according to social identity theory , intergroup conflict starts with a process of comparison between individuals in one group ( the ingroup ) to those of another group ( the outgroup )
