menarche is the culmination of a series of physiological and anatomic processes of puberty : attainment of a sufficient body mass ( typically 17 % body fat ) death of some of the endometrial tissue from these hormone or blood supply fluctuations leads to deciduation , a sloughing of part of the lining with some blood flow from the vagina no specific hormonal signal for menarche is known ; menarche as a discrete event is thought to be the relatively chance result of the gradual thickening of the endometrium induced by rising but fluctuating pubertal estrogen the initial flow of menarche is usually brighter than mature menstrual flow '' like other menses , menarche may be accompanied by abdominal pain in most girls , menarche does not mean that ovulation has occurred in postmenarchal girls , about 80 % of the cycles were anovulatory in the first year after menarche , 50 % in the third and 10 % in the sixth year on the other hand , not every girl follows the typical pattern , and some girls ovulate before the first menstruation although unlikely , it is possible for a girl who has engaged in sexual intercourse shortly before her menarche to conceive and become pregnant , which would delay her menarche until after the end of the pregnancy this goes against the widely held assumption that a woman can not become pregnant until after menarche a young age at menarche is not correlated with a young age at first sexual intercourse when menarche occurs , it confirms that the girl has had a gradual estrogen-induced growth of the uterus , especially the endometrium , and that the '' outflow tract '' from the uterus , through the cervix to the vagina , is open in very rare instances , menarche may occur at an unusually early age , preceding thelarche and other signs of puberty when menarche has failed to occur for more than three years after thelarche , or beyond 16 years of age , the delay is referred to as primary amenorrhea according to a review article , there may also be an association between early age at menarche and breast cancer risk studies have been conducted to observe the association of the timing of menarche with various conditions and diseases some studies have shown that there may be an association between early or late-age menarche and cardiovascular disease , although the mechanism of the association is not well understood there is conflicting evidence regarding the association between obesity and timing of menarche ; a meta-analysis and systematic review has determined that more studies must be conducted to make any definitive conclusions about this association nearly all of the research on these effects has concerned girls , partly because female puberty requires greater physiological resources and partly because menarche involves a clear threshold event that makes survey research into female puberty much simpler than male in most of these studies menarche was specifically examined , assuming it to be a valid '' proxy '' for the more general process of puberty lack of exercise in childhood other research has focused on the effect of childhood stress on timing of puberty , especially female most sources agree that the average age of menarche in girls in modern societies has declined , though the reasons and the degree remain subjects of controversy from the sixth to the fifteenth centuries in europe , most women reached menarche on average at about 14 , between the ages of 12 and 15 in some indian communities , young women are given a special menarche ceremony called ruthu sadangu then , and to an extent now , menstruation was a private matter and a girl 's menarche was not a community phenomenon
