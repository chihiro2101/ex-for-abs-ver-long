q-switching is achieved by putting some type of variable attenuator inside the laser 's optical resonator when the attenuator is functioning , light which leaves the gain medium does not return , and lasing can not begin initially the laser medium is pumped while the q-switch is set to prevent feedback of light into the gain medium ( producing an optical resonator with low q ) since the rate of stimulated emission is dependent on the amount of light entering the medium , the amount of energy stored in the gain medium increases as the medium is pumped due to losses from spontaneous emission and other processes , after a certain time the stored energy will reach some maximum level ; the medium is said to be gain saturated because of the large amount of energy already stored in the gain medium , the intensity of light in the laser resonator builds up very quickly ; this also causes the energy stored in the medium to be depleted almost as quickly the net result is a short pulse of light output from the laser , known as a giant pulse , which may have a very high peak intensity alternatively , when the modulator is in its low-q state , an externally generated beam can be coupled into the cavity through the modulator initially , the loss of the absorber is high , but still low enough to permit some lasing once a large amount of energy is stored in the gain medium the cavity q goes from low to high to start the laser buildup , and then goes from high to low to '' dump '' the beam from the cavity all at once in regenerative amplification , an optical amplifier is placed inside a q-switched cavity pulses of light from another laser ( the '' master oscillator '' ) are injected into the cavity by lowering the q to allow the pulse to enter and then increasing the q to confine the pulse to the cavity where it can be amplified by repeated passes through the gain medium nd : yag lasers are currently the most favoured lasers due to their high peak powers , high repetition rates and relatively low costs
