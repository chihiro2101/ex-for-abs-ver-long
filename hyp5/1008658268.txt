it forms an equilibrium mixture with nitrogen dioxide the molecule is planar with an n-n bond distance of 1.78å and n-o distances of 1.19å the liquid is also colorless but can appear as a brownish yellow liquid due to the presence of no 2 according to the following equilibrium : : n 2 o 4 ⇌ 2 no 2 higher temperatures push the equilibrium towards nitrogen dioxide inevitably , some dinitrogen tetroxide is a component of smog containing nitrogen dioxide the gas is essentially pure nitrogen dioxide , which is condensed into dinitrogen tetroxide in a brine-cooled liquefier dinitrogen tetroxide can also be made through the reaction of concentrated nitric acid and metallic copper the oxidation of copper by nitric acid is a complex reaction forming various nitrogen oxides of varying stability which depends on the concentration of the nitric acid , presence of oxygen , and other factors the unstable species further react to form nitrogen dioxide which is then purified and condensed to form dinitrogen tetroxide gemini and apollo spacecraft and also on the space shuttle , it continues to be used as station-keeping propellant on most geo-stationary satellites , and many deep-space probes when used as a propellant , dinitrogen tetroxide is usually referred to simply as nitrogen tetroxide and the abbreviation nto is extensively used this hot nitrogen dioxide is expanded through a turbine , cooling it and lowering the pressure , and then cooled further in a heat sink , causing it to recombine into nitrogen tetroxide at the original molecular weight
