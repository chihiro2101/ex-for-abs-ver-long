cliff comes from the old english word clif of essentially the same meaning , cognate with dutch , low german , and old norse klif 'cliff' given that a cliff does not need to be exactly vertical , there can be ambiguity about whether a given slope is a cliff or not and also about how much of a certain slope to count as a cliff for example , given a truly vertical rock wall above a very steep slope , one could count just the rock wall or the combination according to other sources , the highest cliff in the world , about 1,340 m high , is the east face of great trango in the karakoram mountains of northern pakistan this uses a fairly stringent notion of cliff , as the 1,340 m figure refers to a nearly vertical headwall of two stacked pillars ; adding in a very steep approach brings the total drop from the east face precipice to the nearby dunge glacier to nearly 2,000 m the location of the world 's highest sea cliffs depends also on the definition of 'cliff ' that is used another contender is the north face of mitre peak , which drops 1,683 m to milford sound , new zealand however , other cliffs on baffin island , such as polar sun spire in the sam ford fjord , or others in remote areas of greenland may be higher trango towers : east face great trango tower , baltoro muztagh , gilgit–baltistan , pakistan , 1,340 m ( near vertical headwall ) , 2,100 m ( very steep overall drop from east summit to dunge glacier ) northwest face drops approximately 2,200 m to the trango glacier below , but with a taller slab topped out with a shorter overhanging headwall of approximately 1,000 m it has a sheer drop of about 4000 ft ( 1200 m ) various cliffs in zhangjiajie national forest park , hunan province , china jon roberts : agdlerussakasit ( 1750 m ) , east face , new route on east face ; the butler ( 900 m ) and mark ( 900 m ) , first ascents & nbsp ; 266–267 other notable cliffs include : mount asgard , baffin island , canada ; vertical drop of about 1,200 & nbsp ; m ( 4,000 & nbsp ; ft ) innumerable peaks in the drakensberg mountains of south africa are considered cliff formations
