that same year , the first pattern languages of programming conference was held , and the following year the portland pattern repository was set up for documentation of design patterns notable books in the design pattern genre include : although design patterns have been applied practically for a long time , formalization of the concept of design patterns languished for several years reusing design patterns helps to prevent such subtle issues , and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns in order to achieve flexibility , design patterns usually introduce additional levels of indirection , which in some cases may complicate the resulting designs and hurt application performance design patterns are composed of several sections ( see below ) efforts have also been made to codify design patterns in particular domains , including use of existing design patterns as well as domain specific design patterns examples include user interface design patterns , information visualization , secure design , '' secure usability '' , web design and business model design design patterns had originally been categorized into 3 sub-classifications based on kind of problem they solve finally , behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns the documentation for a design pattern describes the context in which the pattern is used , the forces within the context that the pattern seeks to resolve , and the suggested solution related patterns : other patterns that have some relationship with the pattern ; discussion of the differences between the pattern and similar patterns
