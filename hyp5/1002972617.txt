the camp david accords were the result of 14 months of diplomatic efforts by egypt , israel , and the united states that began after jimmy carter became president heroic diplomacy : sadat , kissinger , carter , begin , and the quest for arab–israeli peace 228–229 the efforts initially focused on a comprehensive resolution of disputes between israel and the arab countries , gradually evolving into a search for a bilateral agreement between israel and egypt 229–228 '' upon assuming office on 20 january 1977 , president carter moved to rejuvenate the middle east peace process that had stalled throughout the 1976 presidential campaign in the united states israel 's prime minister yitzhak rabin and his successor , menachem begin , were both skeptical of an international conference even earlier , begin had not been opposed to returning the sinai , but a major future obstacle was his firm refusal to consider relinquishing control over the west bank from zbigniew brzezinski , power and principle : memoirs of the national security advisor 1977–1981 , ( new york : farrar , straus and giroux , 1983 ) , p.88 begin responded that he could accept all of these points except the palestinian entity hafez al-assad , who had no interest in negotiating peace with israel , the middle east : ten years after camp david , william b sadat first spoke about the possibility of peace with israel in february 1971 and egypt was the initiator of many moves in the 1970s shortly afterward , the israeli government cordially invited him to address the knesset in a message passed to sadat via the us ambassador to egypt the sadat visit came about after he delivered a speech in egypt stating that he would travel anywhere , '' even jerusalem , '' to discuss peace '' menachem begin , guerrilla leader who became peacemaker that speech led the begin government to declare that , if israel thought that sadat would accept an invitation , israel would invite him in sadat 's knesset speech he talked about his views on peace , the status of israeli occupied territories , and the palestinian refugee problem carter 's people apparently had no inkling of the secret talks in morocco between dayan and sadat 's representative , hassan tuhami , that paved the way for sadat 's initiative indeed , in a sense egypt and israel were ganging up to push carter off his geneva track sadat 's visit was the first step to negotiations such as the preliminary cairo conference in december 1977 a mechanism had yet to be created for israel and egypt to pursue the talks begun by sadat and begin in jerusalem the egyptian president suggested to begin that israel place a secret representative in the american embassy in cairo carter 's acceptance of the proposed liaison scheme would have signaled american backing for sadat 's unprecedented peace initiative within days israeli journalists were allowed into cairo , breaking a symbolic barrier , and from there the peace process quickly gained momentum they believed in a short , loose , and overt linkage between the two countries amplified by the establishment of a coherent basis for a settlement numerous times both the egyptian and israeli leaders wanted to scrap negotiations , only to be lured back into the process by personal appeals from carter the issues of israeli settlement withdrawal from the sinai and the status of the west bank created what seemed to be an impasse in response , carter had the choice of trying to salvage the agreement by conceding the issue of the west bank to begin , while advocating sadat 's less controversial position on the removal of all settlements from the sinai peninsula or he could have refused to continue the talks , reported the reasons for their failure , and allowed begin to bear the brunt of the blame carter chose to continue and for three more days negotiated during this time , carter even took the two leaders to the nearby gettysburg national military park in the hopes of using the american civil war as a simile to their own struggle partly due to carter 's determination in obtaining an israeli–egyptian agreement , a full two-week pledge to a singular international problem both of them had invested enormous amounts of political capital and time to reach an agreement the camp david accords comprise two separate agreements : '' a framework for peace in the middle east '' and '' a framework for the conclusion of a peace treaty between egypt and israel '' , the second leading towards the egypt–israel peace treaty signed in march 1979 the preamble of the '' framework for peace in
