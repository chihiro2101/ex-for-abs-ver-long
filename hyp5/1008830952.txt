the scope of inventory management concerns the balance between replenishment lead time , carrying costs of inventory , asset management , inventory forecasting , inventory valuation , inventory visibility , future inventory price forecasting , physical inventory , available physical space , quality management , replenishment , returns and defective goods , and demand forecasting balancing these competing requirements leads to optimal inventory levels , which is an ongoing process as the business needs shift and react to the wider environment inventory management involves a retailer seeking to acquire and maintain a proper merchandise assortment while ordering , shipping , handling , and related costs are kept in check it also involves systems and processes that identify inventory requirements , set targets , provide replenishment techniques , report actual and projected inventory status and handle all functions related to the tracking and management of material it also may include abc analysis , lot tracking , cycle counting support , etc management of the inventories , with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution system , functions to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock holding and handling costs there are five basic reasons for keeping an inventory time – the time lags present in the supply chain , from supplier to user at every stage , requires that you maintain certain amounts of inventory to use in this lead time this can lead to stock accumulation , consider for example how goods consumed only in holidays can lead to accumulation of large stocks on the anticipation of future consumption so bulk buying , movement and storing brings in economies of scale , thus inventory appreciation in value – in some situations , some stock gains the required value when it is kept for some time to allow it reach the desired standard for consumption , or for production skus can be any combination of letters and numbers chosen , just as long as the system is consistent and used for all the products in the inventory such merchandise may not be produced anymore , and the new old stock may represent the only market source of a particular item at the present time retailers ' inventory may exist in a warehouse or in a shop or store accessible to customers while the reasons for holding stock were covered earlier , most manufacturing organizations usually divide their '' goods for sale '' inventory into : raw materials – materials and components scheduled for use in making a product a canned food manufacturer 's materials inventory includes the ingredients to form the foods to be canned , empty cans and their lids ( or coils of steel or aluminum for constructing those components ) , labels , and anything else ( solder , glue , etc this may be vats of prepared food , filled cans not yet labeled or sub-assemblies of food components it may also include finished cans that are not yet packaged into cartons or pallets pp 29–35 “ strategic positioning of inventory to match demand in a capital projects supply chain ” , k inventory may not only reflect physical items ( such as materials , parts , partially-finished sub-assemblies ) but also knowledge work-in-process ( such as partially completed engineering designs of components and assemblies to be fabricated ) inventory proportionality is the goal of demand-driven inventory management in such a case , there is no '' excess inventory '' , that is , inventory that would be left over of another product when the first product runs out the secondary goal of inventory proportionality is inventory minimization by integrating accurate demand forecasting with inventory management , rather than only looking at past averages , a much more accurate and optimal outcome is expected integrating demand forecasting into inventory management in this way also allows for the prediction of the '' can fit '' point when inventory storage is limited on a per-product basis one early example of inventory proportionality used in a retail application in the united states was for motor fuel inventory proportionality is used to balance the inventories of the different grades of motor fuel , each stored in dedicated tanks , in proportion to the sales of each grade inventory proportionality minimizes the amount of excess inventory carried in underground storage tanks the use of inventory proportionality in the united states is thought to have been inspired by japanese just-in-time parts inventory management made famous by toyota motors in the 1980s those companies ( especially in metalworking ) attempted to achieve success through economies of scope - the gains of jointly producing two or more products in one facility the dominance of financial reporting accounting over management accounting remains to this day with few exceptions , and the financial reporting definitions of 'cost ' have distorted effective management 'cost ' accounting since that time manufacturing management is more interested in inventory turnover ratio or average days to sell inventory since it tells them something about relative inventory levels this number tells how much cash/goods are tied up waiting for the process and is a critical measure of process reliability and effectiveness so a factory with two inventory turns has six months stock on hand , which is generally not a good figure ( depending upon the industry ) , whereas a factory that moves from six turns to twelve turns has probably improved effectiveness by 100 % this improvement will have some negative results in the financial reporting , since the 'value ' now stored in the factory as inventory is reduced there are , in fact , so many things that can vary hidden under this appearance of simplicity that a variety of 'adjusting ' assumptions may be used this effort , known as '' lean production '' will significantly reduce working capital tied up in inventory and reduce manufacturing costs ( see the toyota production system ) due to lifo 's potential to skew inventory value , uk gaap and ias have effectively banned lifo inventory accounting unfortunately , standard cost accounting methods developed about 100 years ago , when labor comprised the most important cost in manufactured goods also known as distressed or expired stock , distressed inventory is inventory whose potential to be sold at a normal cost has passed or will soon pass the possibility of sudden falls in commodity prices means that they are usually reluctant to lend more than about 60 % of the value of the inventory at the time of the loan
