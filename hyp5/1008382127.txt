the party was founded on 7 april 1947 as the arab ba'ath party by michel aflaq ( an antiochian christian ) , salah al-din al-bitar ( a sunni muslim ) , and the followers of zaki al-arsuzi ( an atheist ) in damascus , syria , leading to the establishment of the syrian regional branch other regional branches were established throughout the arab world in the later 1940s and early 1950s , in , among others , iraq , yemen and jordan throughout its existence , the national command ( the body responsible for all-arab affairs ) , gave most attention to syrian affairs the 2nd national congress was convened in june 1954 , and elected a seven-man national command ; aflaq , bitar , and akram al-hawrani were elected and represented the syrian regional branch , while abdullah rimawi and abdallah na'was were elected to represent the jordanian branch the congress is notable for sanctioning the merger of the arab socialist movement and the ba'ath party , which took place in 1952 the syrian regional branch rose to prominence in the 1940s and 1950s ; in the 1954 parliamentary elections the syrian regional branch won 22 seats in parliament , becoming the second largest party in the country 90 percent of ba'ath party members who stood for elections were elected to parliament the failure of the traditional parties represented by the people 's party and the national party , strengthened the ba'ath party 's public credibility through this position , the party was able to get two of its members into the cabinet ; bitar was appointed minister of foreign affairs and khalil kallas became minister of economics its new , strengthened position , was used successfully to garner support for syria 's merger with gamal abdel nasser 's egypt , which led to the establishment of the united arab republic ( uar ) in 1958 on 24 june 1959 , fuad al-rikabi , the regional secretary of the iraqi regional branch , accused the national command of betraying arab nationalist principles by conspiring against the uar the congress is notable for endorsing the dissolution of the syrian regional branch , which had been decided by aflaq and bitar without inner-party consultation in 1958 , and for expelling rimawi , the regional secretary of the jordanian regional branch rimawi reacted to his expulsion by forming his own party , the arab socialist revolutionary ba'ath party , which established a rival national command to compete with the original the national command responded to the problems in iraq by appointing a temporary regional command on 2 february 1960 , which appointed talib el-shibib as regional secretary , and on 15 june 1961 the national command expelled rikabi from the party the iraqi ba'athists supported qasim on the ground that they believed he would enter iraq into the uar , enlarging the arab nationalist republic declassified documents and the testimony of former cia officers indicate there was no direct american involvement , although the cia had been previously notified of an earlier ba'athist coup plot in july 1962 by a high-ranking informant within the party '' the iraqi regional branch , when it took power , was so riven by factionalism that its purported allies launched a counter-coup forcing them out of power in november 1963 the 4th national congress , held in august 1960 , criticized the leadership of aflaq and bitar , called for the reestablishment of the syrian regional branch and deemphasized the party 's commitment to arab nationalism while emphasizing more the socialist character of the party a year after , at the uar 's nadir in syria , the syrian general abd al-karim al-nahlawi launched a coup on 28 september 1961 , which led to the reestablishment of the syrian arab republic the iraqi regional branch was increasingly dominated by ali salih al-sadi , a self-described marxism he was supported in his ideological reorientation by hammud al-shufi , the regional secretary of the syrian regional branch , yasin al-hafiz , one of the party ’ s few ideological theorists , and by certain members of the secret military committee aflaq , angry at this transformation of his party , retained a nominal leadership role , but the national command as a whole came under the control of the radicals the moderate faction , formerly led by aflaq and al-bitar , were purged from the party however , both in iraq and syria , the regional command became the real centre of party power , and the membership of the national command became a largely honorary position , often the destination of figures being eased out of the leadership the organizational structure of the ba'ath party was created at the 2nd national congress by amending the party 's internal regulations , which was approved at the party 's 1st national congress in 1947 the organizational structure ran from top to bottom , and members were forbidden to initiate contacts between groups on the same level of the organisation—all contacts had to pass through a higher command level the national consultative council was a forum made up of representatives from the party 's regional branches however , the number of national consultative council members were decided by the size of the regional branch the national congress elected the national command , national tribunal , the party 's discipline body , and the secretary-general , the party leader the congress delegates determined the party 's policies and procedures in ba'athist jargon '' nation '' means the arab nation , because of that , the national command formed the highest policy-making and coordinating council for the ba'ath movement throughout the arab world the national command had several bureaus , similar to those of the regional command the regional congress is made of delegates from the provincial branches ; other members attended , but as observers the regional command , similar to the branch command , operated through bureaus and met for weekly-sessions the branch held a congress periodically in which it elected a command and a secretary ( leader ) there existed three types of membership categories in the ba'ath party ; active member ( arabic : udw ämil ) , apprentice member ( arabic : udw mutadarrib ) and supporter ( arabic : firqa ) party ideology , and ba'athism in general , was not based on concepts such as the purity of the arab race or ethnic chauvinism , but on idealistic thoughts borrowed from the enlightenment era the arab nation is considered , philosophically speaking , not as a social and economic formation , but as a transcendent fact inspiring different forms , one of its highest contributions taking the form of islam it was not islam that modeled the peoples of arabia , the fertile crescent , and north africa , equipping them with islamic values , especially the arabic language and the arabic culture , but the arab nation which created islam the peasants never constituted an object of his special concern issues such as these would only gain prominence when akram al-hawrani became a leading party figure , and when the '' transitional ba'athists '' took power when the akram al-hawrani 's arab socialist party ( asp ) merged with the ba'ath party , the majority of asp members of peasants origins did not join the ba'ath party , instead becoming personal followers of hawrani the slogan '' unity , liberty , socialism '' is the key tenet in ba'athist thought after the failure of the united arab republic ( uar ) , a union of egypt and syria , the ba'ath party was divided into two main factions , the regionalists and the nationalists ( pan-arab ) when the union with egypt collapsed , the ba'ath party was put in a difficult position , the party still sought arab unity , but did not oppose the uar 's dissolution and did not want to seek another union with egypt under gamal abdel nasser 's rule the end result was that the pro-arab nationalists within the ba'ath party became committed nasserists , while the more moderate arab nationalists founded the pro-nasserite socialist unionists party many rank-and-file members opposed this change in policy , with many members being both disenchanted with pan-arabism and aflaq 's continued party rule jamal al-atassi , who had been a moderate socialist for most of his life , called for the renunciation of arab socialism in 1963 and the adoption of a '' virtually marxist concept of socialism '' by claiming that class conflict was the moving force in society hammud al-shufi became the leader of the party 's marxist faction during his short stint as syrian regional secretary , literally the head of the syrian regional organization the document , which was approved by the 6th national congress , relegated arab unity to a secondary role and gave socialism prominence what is certain is that rikabi was elected the regional branch 's first regional secretary in 1952 however , the regional branch leaders rimawi , na'was , gharbiyah and munif al-razzaz opposed such an idea , and because of it , shuqyar left the ba'ath party however , at the same time , the lebanese regional branch opposed hawrani and his faction the ba'ath party had only 2,500 members by mid-1963 , the party lacked a popular base the saudi regional branches elected ali ghannäm to represent them at the 7th national command
