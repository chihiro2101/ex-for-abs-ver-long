the purpose of any engine bell is to direct the exhaust of a rocket engine in one direction , generating thrust in the opposite direction the bell redirects exhaust moving in the wrong direction so that it generates thrust in the correct direction ambient air pressure also imparts a small pressure against the exhaust , helping to keep it moving in the '' right '' direction as it exits the engine , outward from the main exhaust plume ) , the efficiency of the engine is reduced as the rocket travels because this escaping exhaust is no longer contributing to the thrust of the engine instead of firing the exhaust out of a small hole in the middle of a bell , an aerospike engine avoids this random distribution by firing along the outside edge of a wedge-shaped protrusion , the '' spike '' , which serves the same function as a traditional engine bell the idea behind the aerospike design is that at low altitude the ambient pressure compresses the exhaust against the spike since the pressure in front of the vehicle is ambient , this means that the exhaust at the base of the spike nearly balances out with the drag experienced by the vehicle as the vehicle climbs to higher altitudes , the air pressure holding the exhaust against the spike decreases , as does the drag in front of the vehicle aerospikes work relatively poorly between mach 1â€“3 , where the airflow around the vehicle has reduced the pressure , thus reducing the thrust this work on aerospike engines continues ; prospector-10 , a ten-chamber aerospike engine , was test-fired june 25 , 2008 small-scale aerospike engine development using a hybrid rocket propellant configuration has been ongoing by members of the reaction research society in march 2017 arca space corporation announced their intention to build a single-stage-to-orbit rocket ( ssto ) , named haas 2ca , using a linear aerospike engine in june 2017 , arca announced that they would fly their demonstrator3 rocket to space , also using a linear aerospike engine in september 2017 , arca announced that , after being delayed , their linear aerospike engine was ready to perform ground tests and flight tests on a demonstrator3 rocket
