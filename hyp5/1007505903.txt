fischer black ( 1972 ) developed another version of capm , called black capm or zero-beta capm , that does not assume the existence of a riskless asset the capm returns the asset-appropriate required return or discount rate—i.e the rate at which future cash flows produced by the asset should be discounted given that asset 's relative riskiness betas exceeding one signify more than average '' riskiness '' ; betas below one indicate lower than average given the accepted concave utility function , the capm is consistent with intuition—investors ( should ) require a higher return for holding a more risky asset market risk , the market as a whole , by definition , has a beta of one stock market indices are frequently used as local proxies for the market—and in that case ( by definition ) have a beta of one the risk of a portfolio comprises systematic risk , also known as undiversifiable risk , and specific risk which is also known as idiosyncratic risk or diversifiable risk systematic risk refers to the risk common to all securities—i.e the same is not possible for systematic risk within one market depending on the market , a portfolio of approximately 30–40 securities in developed markets such as the uk or us will render the portfolio sufficiently diversified such that risk exposure is limited to systematic risk only a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk , as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model therefore , the required return on an asset , that is , the return that compensates for risk taken , must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context—i.e in the capm context , portfolio risk is represented by higher variance i.e in other words , the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor the capm assumes that the risk-return profile of a portfolio can be optimized—an optimal portfolio displays the lowest possible level of risk for its level of return because the unsystematic risk is diversifiable , the total risk of a portfolio can be viewed as beta this assumes no preference between markets and assets for individual active and potential shareholders , and that active and potential shareholders choose assets solely as a function of their risk-return profile capm assumes that all active and potential shareholders will consider all of their assets and optimize one portfolio the treynor capital asset pricing model , journal of investment management , vol the capital asset pricing model ( capm ) , short-sale restrictions and related issues , journal of finance , 32 ( 177 ) stone , bernell k
