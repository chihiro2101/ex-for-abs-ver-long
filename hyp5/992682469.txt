joachim du bellay was born at the castle of la turmelière , not far from liré , near angers , being the son of jean du bellay , lord of gonnor , first cousin of the cardinal jean du bellay and of guillaume du bellay both his parents died while he was still a child , and he was left to the guardianship of his elder brother , rené du bellay , who neglected his education , leaving him to run wild at la turmelière when he was twenty-three , however , he received permission to study law at the university of poitiers , no doubt with a view to his obtaining preferment through his kinsman the cardinal jean du bellay there too he probably met jacques peletier du mans , who had published a translation of the ars poetica of horace , with a preface in which much of the program advocated later by la pléiade is to be found in outline it was probably in 1547 that du bellay met ronsard in an inn on the way to poitiers , an event which may justly be regarded as the starting-point of the french school of renaissance poetry du bellay returned with ronsard to paris to join the circle of students of the humanities attached to jean dorat at the collège de coqueret while ronsard and jean-antoine de baïf were most influenced by greek models , du bellay was more especially a latinist , and perhaps his preference for a language so nearly connected with his own had some part in determining the more national and familiar note of his poetry the famous manifesto of the pléiade , the défense et illustration de la langue française ( defense and illustration of the french language , 1549 ) , was at once a complement and a refutation of sébillet 's treatise to obtain a clear view of the reforms aimed at by the pléiade , the defence should be further considered in connection with ronsard 's abrégé d'art poétique and his preface to the franciade du bellay maintained that the french language as it was then constituted was too poor to serve as a medium for the higher forms of poetry , but he contended that by proper cultivation it might be brought on a level with the classical tongues both du bellay and ronsard laid stress on the necessity of prudence in these borrowings , and both repudiated the charge of wishing to latinize their mother tongue olive has been supposed to be an anagram for the name of a mlle viole , but there is little evidence of real passion in the poems , and they may perhaps be regarded as a petrarchan exercise , especially as , in the second edition , the dedication to his lady is exchanged for one to marguerite de valois , daughter of henry ii both works were published under the pseudonym of j quintil du troussay , and the courtier-poet was generally supposed to be mellin de saint-gelais , with whom du bellay had always , however , been on friendly terms in the exercise of these functions joachim quarrelled with eustache du bellay , bishop of paris , who prejudiced his relations with the cardinal , less cordial since the publication of the outspoken regrets sainte-beuve , tableau de la poésie française au xvi siècle ( 1828 ) la défense et illust biography , bibliography , analysis university of virginia 's gordon project a 1569 edition of du bellay 's works and background information the first complete translation into english of du bellay 's antiquités de rome since spenser lyrics of the french renaissance : marot , du bellay , ronsard by norman r
