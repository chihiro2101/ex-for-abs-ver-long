the first debate in crowd psychology began in rome at the first international congress of criminal anthropology on 16 november 1885 '' a weak response was offered by the french , who put forward an environmental theory of human psychology '' the psychology of crowd dynamics '' , blackwell handbook of social psychology : group processes the anomalies observed by lombroso were met with in honest men as well as criminals , manouvrier claimed , and there is no physical difference between them it is in this context that you have a debate between scipio sighele , an italian lawyer and gabriel tarde , a french magistrate on how to determine criminal responsibility in the crowd and hence who to arrest ( sighele , 1892 ; tarde , 1890 , 1892 , 1901 ) literature on crowds and crowd behavior appeared as early as 1841 , with the publication of charles mackay 's book extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds the attitude towards crowds underwent an adjustment with the publication of hippolyte taine 's six-volume the origins of contemporary france ( 1875 ) while it is difficult to directly link his works to crowd behavior , it may be said that his thoughts stimulated further study of crowd behavior french physician and anthropologist gustave le bon became its most-influential theorist the origins of crowd psychology crowds , psychology and politics 1871–1899 generally , researchers in crowd psychology have focused on the negative aspects of crowds , but not all crowds are volatile or negative in nature civil disobedience , rock concerts , and religious revivals all fall under this category le bon held that crowds existed in three stages : submergence , contagion , and suggestion contagion refers to the propensity for individuals in a crowd to unquestioningly follow the predominant ideas and emotions of the crowd suggestion refers to the period in which the ideas and emotions of the crowd are primarily drawn from a shared unconscious ideology crowd members become susceptible to any passing idea or emotion this behavior comes from an archaic shared unconscious and is therefore uncivilized in nature le bon believed that crowds could be a powerful force only for destruction additionally , le bon and others have indicated that crowd members feel a lessened sense of legal culpability , due to the difficulty in prosecuting individual members of a mob in short , the individual submerged in the crowd loses self control as the '' collective mind '' takes over and makes the crowd member capable of violating personal or social norms le bon 's idea that crowds foster anonymity and generate emotion has been contested by some critics additionally , le bon 's theory ignores the socio-cultural context of the crowd , which some theorists argue can disempower social change sigmund freud 's crowd behavior theory primarily consists of the idea that becoming a member of a crowd serves to unlock the unconscious mind this occurs because the super-ego , or moral center of consciousness , is displaced by the larger crowd , to be replaced by a charismatic crowd leader this organizational structure is that of the '' primal horde '' —pre-civilized society—and freud states that one must rebel against the leader ( re-instate the individual morality ) in order to escape from it convergence theory holds that crowd behavior is not a product of the crowd , but rather the crowd is a product of the coming together of like-minded individuals these garner attention , and the lack of negative response elicited from the crowd as a whole stands as tacit agreement to their legitimacy however , if the crowd is primarily related to some identifiable group ( such as christians or hindus or muslims or civil-rights activists ) , then the values of that group will dictate the crowd 's action in crowds which are more ambiguous , individuals will assume a new social identity as a member of the crowd jaap van ginneken , crowds , psychology and politics 1871–1899 , new york : cambridge university press , 1992
