the investigation of the nucleus was done by three optical spectrometers , one microwave radio antenna and one radar : alice ( an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ) the ultraviolet spectroscopy searched for and quantified the noble gas content in the comet nucleus , from which the temperature during the comet creation could be estimated alice was built and operated by the southwest research institute for nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory development and construction of the instrument was led by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) miro ( microwave instrument for the rosetta orbiter ) the consert experiment provided information about the deep interior of the comet using radar the radar performed tomography of the nucleus by measuring electromagnetic wave propagation between the philae lander and the rosetta orbiter through the comet nucleus rsi made use of the probe 's communication system for physical investigation of the nucleus and the inner coma of the comet the rtof was highly sensitive for neutral molecules and for ions the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) has contributed to the deveplopment and construction of the instrument cosima was built by the max planck institute for extraterrestrial physics ( mpe , germany ) with international contributions the cosima team is led by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps , germany ) previous observations have shown that comets contain complex organic compounds comets are thought to have delivered a vast quantity of water to earth , and they may have also seeded earth with organic molecules ; amino acids upon landing on the comet , philae should have also tested some hypotheses as to why essential amino acids are almost all '' left-handed '' , which refers to how the atoms arrange in orientation in relation to the carbon core of the molecule the supernova could wipe out one type of molecules while also flinging the other surviving molecules into space , where they could eventually end up on a planet the virtis spectrometer on board the rosetta spacecraft has provided evidence of nonvolatile organic macromolecular compounds everywhere on the surface of comet 67p with little to no water ice visible in turn , the philae lander 's cosac instrument detected organic molecules in the comet 's atmosphere as it descended to its surface measurements by the cosac and ptolemy instruments on the philae lander revealed sixteen organic compounds , four of which were seen for the first time on a comet , including acetamide , acetone , methyl isocyanate and propionaldehyde one of the most outstanding discoveries of the mission was the detection of large amounts of free molecular oxygen gas surrounding the comet 8 november – catalina sky survey briefly misidentified the rosetta spacecraft , approaching for its second earth flyby , as a newly discovered asteroid ; 2014 may to july – starting on 7 may , rosetta began orbital correction manoeuvres to bring itself into orbit around 67p 14 july – the osiris on-board imaging system returned images of comet 67p which confirmed the irregular shape of the comet after the success of the series , however , the esa commissioned the studio to continue producing new episodes in the series throughout the course of the mission file : chasing a comet - the rosetta mission.webm about rosetta mission ( 9 min , 1080p hd , english ) file : landing on a comet - the rosetta mission.webm about philae landing ( 10 min
