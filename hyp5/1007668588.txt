the aire and calder is a canalisation of the river calder from wakefield to castleford , where it joins the branch from leeds , which follows the river aire the aire continues to flow eastwards to bank dole junction , then continues in a north-easterly direction to haddlesey , from where it follows a winding course to join the river ouse at airmyn the section below haddlesey is no longer part of the navigation , as a derelict lock blocks access to the lower river instead , the selby canal flows northwards from haddlesey to the ouse at selby below dole bank junction , the knottingley and goole canal flows eastwards to join the ouse at goole from just before newbridge , where the modern a614 road crosses the waterway , this branch of the navigation runs parallel to the dutch river , an artificial channel built in 1635 to alleviate flooding caused by cornelius vermuyden 's original diversion of the river don northwards to the river aire in 1628 the aire and calder still fulfils its original purpose of linking leeds and wakefield with york and the humber ( and thence the trent ) , although the routes by which this is achieved have changed significantly beyond leeds , the leeds and liverpool canal carries boats over the pennines the calder and hebble navigation , which connects to the navigation at wakefield , allows boats to reach the huddersfield broad and narrow canals , and the rochdale canal the selby canal connects to the ouse , from where boats can travel upstream to reach york , boroughbridge and ripon , or downstream to the river derwent in the early 1600s , the river aire was navigable to knottingley , and boats carrying up to 30 & nbsp ; tons traded on the river , which was tidal up to this point a bill was drawn up in 1698 , with support from wool traders in leeds and general merchants in wakefield although the bill had a lot of support , it was opposed by the city of york , who feared that the river ouse would be damaged by the scheme the parliamentary bill was hotly contested , and the house of lords asked trinity house to produce a report on the three rivers it named 18 undertakers , nine from the corporation of leeds , and nine '' gentlemen of wakefield '' , who would oversee the improvements to the river aire ( from the river ouse at airmyn via castleford to leeds ) and the river calder ( from castleford to wakefield ) john hadley was engaged as the engineer immediately , and by 1704 the original work was completed , including 12 locks on the aire between haddesley and leeds and 4 on the calder the recently finished calder and hebble navigation proposed to build a canal from wakefield to the dutch river , which would bypass the calder completely , and the leeds and liverpool canal supported a leeds to selby canal , which would bypass the aire during 1772 , they asked smeaton to survey a route to avoid the lower aire , but his assistant , william jessop actually carried out the work he proposed a canal from haddlesey lock to the ouse at newland in 1774 the leeds to selby bill was rejected by parliament , but the aire and calder bill was passed , aire and calder navigation act 1774 ( 14 geo selby was the upper limit for seagoing ships at the time , and became a major transhipment port for the smaller boats using the canal those opposing the scheme were placated by a clause which ensured the aire to airmyn and the selby canal would be maintained in july 1821 , rennie proposed the construction of docks at goole , rather than a lock into the river , and the company proposed that of water should be available around 1864 , the aire and calder dabbled in owning its own railways , purchasing the silkstone waggonway from the barnsley canal in 1905 , the new junction canal connected the aire and calder to the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation near stainforth the main problem with upgrading the wakefield branch was the dimensions of stanley ferry aqueduct over the river calder at stanley ferry between wakefield and leeds , via castleford , the navigation is part of a circular cruising route or '' ring '' , formed by the leeds & liverpool and the huddersfield or rochdale canals
