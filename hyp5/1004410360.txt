in december 1998 , the ietf published - definition of the differentiated services field ( ds field ) in the ipv4 and ipv6 headers , which replaced the ipv4 tos field with the ds field diffserv-aware routers implement per-hop behaviors ( phbs ) , which define the packet-forwarding properties associated with a class of traffic rather than differentiating network traffic based on the requirements of an individual flow , diffserv operates on the principle of traffic classification , placing each data packet into one of a limited number of traffic classes each traffic class can be managed differently , ensuring preferential treatment for higher-priority traffic on the network a group of routers that implement common , administratively defined diffserv policies are referred to as a diffserv domain while diffserv does recommend a standardized set of traffic classes , the diffserv architecture does not incorporate predetermined judgments of what types of traffic should be given priority treatment diffserv simply provides a framework to allow classification and differentiated treatment traffic classifiers may honor any diffserv markings in received packets or may elect to ignore or override those markings for tight control over volumes and type of traffic in a given class , a network operator may choose not to honor markings at the ingress to the diffserv domain traffic in each class may be further conditioned by subjecting the traffic to rate limiting , traffic policers or shapers explicit congestion notification ( ecn ) occupies the least-significant 2 bits of the ipv4 tos field and ipv6 traffic class ( tc ) field filtering dscp in theory , a network could have up to 64 different traffic classes using the 64 available dscp values ef traffic is often given priority queue above all other traffic classes because an overload of ef traffic will cause queuing delays and affect the jitter and delay tolerances within the class , admission control , traffic policing and other mechanisms may be applied to ef traffic — definition of the differentiated services field ( ds field ) in the ipv4 and ipv6 headers — a differentiated services code point ( dscp ) for capacity-admitted traffic
