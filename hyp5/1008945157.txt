before the introduction of digital printing technology , production of small numbers of publications had many limitations large print jobs were not a problem , but small numbers of printed pages were typically during the early 20th century produced using stencils and reproducing on a mimeograph or similar machine and to print on a teletypewriter , line printer or other computer printer , but the software and hardware to produce original good-quality printed colour text and graphics and to print small jobs fast and cheaply was unavailable print on demand with digital technology is a way to print items for a fixed cost per copy , regardless of the size of the order pod has other business benefits besides lesser costs ( for small jobs ) : technical set-up is usually quicker than for offset printing large inventories of a book or print material do not need to be kept in stock , reducing storage , handling costs , and inventory accounting costs many publishers use pod for other printing needs other than books such as galley proof , catalogs and review copies digital technology is ideally suited to publish small print jobs of posters ( often as a single copy ) when they are needed for example , uk art retailer king and mcgaw fulfills many of its art print orders by printing on-demand rather than pre-printing and storing them until they are sold , requiring less space and reducing overheads to the business pod creates a new category of publishing ( or printing ) company that offers services , usually for a fee , directly to authors who wish to self-publish other services may also be available , including formatting , proofreading , and editing , but such companies typically do not spend money for marketing , unlike conventional publishers pod publishing gives authors editorial independence , speed to market , ability to revise content , and greater financial return per copy than royalties paid by conventional publishers print-on-demand services that offer printing and distributing services to publishing companies ( instead of directly to self-publishing authors ) are also growing in popularity within the industry print on demand is also used to print and reprint '' niche '' books that may have a high retail price but limited sales opportunities , such as specialist academic works because the per-unit cost is typically greater with pod than with a print job of thousands of copies , it is common for pod books to be more expensive than similar books made by conventional print jobs , especially if a book is produced exclusively with pod instead of using pod as a supplemental technology between print jobs pod books are rarely if ever available on such terms because for the publishing provider it is considered too much of a risk
