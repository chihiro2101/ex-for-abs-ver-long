usually , an enzyme molecule has only two active sites , and the active sites fit with one specific type of substrate an active site contains a binding site that binds the substrate and orients it for catalysis the orientation of the substrate and the close proximity between it and the active site is so important that in some cases the enzyme can still function properly even though all other parts are mutated and lose function initially , the interaction between the active site and the substrate is non-covalent and transient there are four important types of interaction that hold the substrate in a defined orientation and form an enzyme-substrate complex ( es complex ) : hydrogen bonds , van der waals force , hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions the charge distribution on the substrate and active site must be complementary , which means all positive and negative charges must be cancelled out the active site usually contains non-polar amino acids , although sometimes polar amino acids may also occur for example , alcohol dehydrogenase which catalyses the transfer of a hydride ion from ethanol to nadh interacts with the substrate methyl group , hydroxyl group and the pro- ( r ) hydrogen that will be abstracted during the reaction if these interactions are interfered with , for example by extreme ph values , high temperature or high ion concentrations , this will cause the enzyme to denature and lose its catalytic activity a tighter fit between an active site and the substrate molecule is believed to increase the efficiency of a reaction if the tightness between the active site of dna polymerase and its substrate is increased , the fidelity , which means the correct rate of dna replication will also increase most enzymes have deeply buried active sites , which can be accessed by a substrate via access channels there are three proposed models of how enzymes fit their specific substrate : the lock and key model , the induced fit model , and the conformational selection model the latter two are not mutually exclusive : conformational selection can be followed by a change in the enzyme 's shape amino acids at the binding site of ubiquitin generally follow the induced fit model , whereas the rest of the protein generally adheres to conformational selection factors such as temperature likely influences the pathway taken during binding , with higher temperatures predicted to increase the importance of conformational selection and decrease that of induced fit he proposed that the active site and substrate are two stable structures that fit perfectly without any further modification , just like a key fits into a lock if one substrate perfectly binds to its active site , the interactions between them will be strongest , resulting in high catalytic efficiency for example , the competitive enzyme inhibitor methylglucoside can bind tightly to the active site of 4-alpha-glucanotransferase and perfectly fits into it the induced fit model is a development of the lock-and-key model and assumes that an active site is flexible and changes shape until the substrate is completely bound conformational changes may then occur as the substrate is bound after the reaction products will move away from the enzyme and the active site returns to its initial shape in the end , the active site may manipulate the molecular orbital of the substrate into a suitable orientation to reduce activation energy but more often groups in substrate and active site act as brønsted–lowry acid and base this is called general acid and general base theory so conformational distortion was introduced and argues that both active site and substrate can undergo conformational changes to fit with each other all the time . preorganised active site complementarity to the transition state in reality , most enzyme mechanisms involve a combination of several different types of catalysis during this process , its thiol side chain is oxidised and two glutathione molecules are connected by a disulphide bond to form a dimer ( gssg ) in the active site , there are two cysteine residues besides the fad cofactor and are used to break the disulphide bond during the catalytic reaction the catalytic process starts when the fad is reduced by nadph to accept one electron and from fadh − it receives one proton in solution and forms the second glutathione monomer in the active site of this enzyme , three amino acid residues work together to form a catalytic triad which makes up the catalytic site as a result , they can fit into the active site and trigger favourable interactions to fill in the space and block substrates from entry since they do not compete with substrates for the active site , they can not be overcome by simply increasing the substrate concentration enzyme inhibitor are similar to competitive inhibitors as they both bind to the active site
