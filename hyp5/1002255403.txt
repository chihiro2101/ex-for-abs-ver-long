the first practical large-scale application of stratigraphy was by william smith in the 1790s and early 19th century known as the '' father of english geology '' , smith recognized the significance of strata or rock layering and the importance of fossil markers for correlating strata ; he created the first geologic map of england other influential applications of stratigraphy in the early 19th century were by georges cuvier and alexandre brongniart , who studied the geology of the region around paris image : geology of cyprus-chalk.jpg thumb chalk layers in cyprus , showing sedimentary layering variation in rock units , most obviously displayed as visible layering , is due to physical contrasts in rock type ( lithology ) the basic concept in stratigraphy , called the law of superposition , states : in an undeformed stratigraphic sequence , the oldest strata occur at the base of the sequence biostratigraphy or paleontology stratigraphy is based on fossil evidence in the rock layers the geologic time scale was developed during the 19th century , based on the evidence of biologic stratigraphy and faunal succession stratigraphy is also commonly used to delineate the nature and extent of hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir rocks , seals , and traps of petroleum geology chronostratigraphy is the branch of stratigraphy that places an absolute age , rather than a relative age on rock strata the ultimate aim of chronostratigraphy is to place dates on the sequence of deposition of all rocks within a geological region , and then to every region , and by extension to provide an entire geologic record of the earth if the ancient magnetic field were oriented similar to today 's field ( north magnetic pole near the north pole ) , the strata would retain a normal polarity ics subcommission for stratigraphic information university of south carolina sequence stratigraphy web front range stratigraphy international commission on stratigraphy university of georgia ( usa ) stratigraphy lab stratigraphy.net a stratigraphic data provider
