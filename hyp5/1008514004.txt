macrophages that reside in adult healthy tissues either derive from circulating monocytes or are established before birth and then maintained during adult life independently of monocytes by contrast , most of the macrophages that accumulate at diseased sites typically derive from circulating monocytes when a monocyte enters damaged tissue through the endothelium of a blood vessel , a process known as leukocyte extravasation , it undergoes a series of changes to become a macrophage monocytes are attracted to a damaged site by chemical substances through chemotaxis , triggered by a range of stimuli including damaged cells , pathogens and cytokines released by macrophages already at the site unlike short-lived neutrophils , macrophages survive longer in the body , up to several months macrophages are professional phagocytes and are highly specialized in removal of dying or dead cells and cellular debris this role is important in chronic inflammation , as the early stages of inflammation are dominated by neutrophils , which are ingested by macrophages if they come of age ( see cd31 for a description of this process ) when at the site , the first wave of neutrophils , after the process of aging and after the first 48 hours , stimulate the appearance of the macrophages whereby these macrophages will then ingest the aged neutrophils the removal of dying cells is , to a greater extent , handled by fixed macrophages , which will stay at strategic locations such as the lungs , liver , neural tissue , bone , spleen and connective tissue , ingesting foreign materials such as pathogens and recruiting additional macrophages if needed typhoidal salmonellae induce their own phagocytosis by host macrophages in vivo , and inhibit digestion by lysosomal action , thereby using macrophages for their own replication and causing macrophage apoptosis along with dendritic cells , they are foremost among the cells that present antigens , a crucial role in initiating an immune response as secretory cells , monocytes and macrophages are vital to the regulation of immune responses and the development of inflammation ; they produce a wide array of powerful chemical substances ( monokines ) including enzymes , complement proteins , and regulatory factors such as interleukin-1 after digesting a pathogen , a macrophage will present the antigen ( a molecule , most often a protein found on the surface of the pathogen and used by the immune system for identification ) of the pathogen to the corresponding helper t cell the presentation is done by integrating it into the cell membrane and displaying it attached to an mhc class ii molecule ( mhcii ) , indicating to other white blood cells that the macrophage is not a pathogen , despite having antigens on its surface the antigen presentation on the surface of infected macrophages ( in the context of mhc class ii ) in a lymph node stimulates th1 ( type 1 helper t cells ) to proliferate ( mainly due to il-12 secretion from the macrophage ) m1 macrophages : as mentioned earlier ( previously referred to as classically activated macrophages ) , m1 '' killer '' macrophages are activated by lps and ifn-gamma , and secrete high levels of il-12 and low levels of il-10 m2 macrophages produce high levels of il-10 , tgf-beta and low levels of il-12 tumor-associated macrophages are mainly of the m2 phenotype , and seem to actively promote tumor growth these mediator molecules create a pro-inflammatory response that in return produce pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 and tnf unlike m1 macrophages , m2 macrophages secrete an anti-inflammatory response via the addition of interleukin-4 or interleukin-13 this dysregulation results in insufficient m2 macrophages and its corresponding growth factors that aid in wound repair with a lack of these growth factors/anti-inflammatory cytokines and an overabundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines from m1 macrophages chronic wounds are unable to heal in a timely manner however , dysregulation occurs as the m1 macrophages are unable/do not phagocytose neutrophils that have undergone apoptosis leading to increased macrophage migration and inflammation m1 & nbsp ; macrophages promote atherosclerosis by inflammation m2 & nbsp ; macrophages can remove cholesterol from blood vessels , but when the cholesterol is oxidized , the m2 & nbsp ; macrophages become apoptosis foam cells contributing to the atheroma of atherosclerosis the first step to understanding the importance of macrophages in muscle repair , growth , and regeneration is that there are two '' waves '' of macrophages with the onset of damageable muscle use & nbsp ; – subpopulations that do and do not directly have an influence on repairing muscle these early-invading , phagocytic macrophages reach their highest concentration about 24 hours following the onset of some form of muscle cell injury or reloading it is thought that macrophages release soluble substances that influence the proliferation , differentiation , growth , repair , and regeneration of muscle , but at this time the factor that is produced to mediate these effects is unknown attracted to the wound site by growth factors released by platelets and other cells , monocytes from the bloodstream enter the area through blood vessel walls numbers of monocytes in the wound peak one to one and a half days after the injury occurs macrophages also secrete a number of factors such as growth factors and other cytokines , especially during the third and fourth post-wound days these factors attract cells involved in the proliferation stage of healing to the area by secreting these factors , macrophages contribute to pushing the wound healing process into the next phase scientists have elucidated that as well as eating up material debris , macrophages are involved in the typical limb regeneration in the salamander every tissue harbors its own specialized population of resident macrophages , which entertain reciprocal interconnections with the stroma and functional tissue for example , macrophages may have cytotoxic activity to kill tumor cells directly ; also the co-operation of t-cells and macrophages is important to suppress tumors like macrophages , intestinal macrophages are differentiated monocytes , though intestinal macrophages have to coexist with the microbiota in the intestines to prevent the destruction of the gut bacteria , intestinal macrophages have developed key differences compared to other macrophages whereas tissue macrophages release various inflammatory cytokines , such as il-1 , il-6 and tnf-α , intestinal macrophages do not produce or secrete inflammatory cytokines
