image : chicxulub-anomaly.jpg thumb gravity anomaly map of the chicxulub impact area penfield 's job was to use geophysical data to scout possible locations for oil drilling in the offshore magnetic data , penfield noted anomalies whose depth he estimated , and mapped according to penfield , '' the old data showed a large concentric set of onshore gravity anomalies '' a decade earlier , the same map suggested an impact feature to contractor robert baltosser , but he was forbidden to publicize his conclusion by pemex corporate policy of the time coincidentally , many experts in impact craters and the cretaceous–paleogene boundary were attending a separate conference on earth impacts penfield tried to secure site samples , but was told such samples had been lost or destroyed ' so when haitian professor florentine morás discovered what he thought to be evidence of an ancient volcano on haiti , hildebrand suggested it could be a telltale feature of a nearby impact in 1990 , houston chronicle reporter carlos byars told hildebrand of penfield 's earlier discovery of a possible impact crater hildebrand contacted penfield in april 1990 and the pair soon secured two drill samples from the pemex wells , stored in new orleans more recent evidence suggests the crater is wide , and the 180 & nbsp ; km ring is an inner wall of it the impact created a hole wide and deep , leaving a crater mainly under the sea and covered by of sediment by the 21st century the impact would have caused a megatsunami over tall that would have reached all the way to what are now texas and florida the height of the tsunami was limited by the relatively shallow sea in the area of the impact ; in deep ocean it would have been tall nonetheless , the most recent simulations show that waves may have been up to 1.5 kilometers ( ~1 & nbsp ; mi ) tall , able to reach the coastal lines all over the world a cloud of hot dust , ash and steam would have spread from the crater as the impactor burrowed underground in less than a second '' on the ground , you would feel an effect similar to an oven on broil , lasting for about an hour over a decade or longer , sunlight would have been blocked from reaching the surface of the earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere , cooling the surface dramatically image : iridium clay layer.png thumb right the piece of clay , held by walter alvarez , that sparked research into the impact theory the greenish-brown band in the center is extremely rich in iridium hildebrand , penfield , et al these andesitic igneous rocks were only found within the supposed impact feature , as is shocked quartz along the edge of the crater are clusters of cenotes or sinkholes , which suggest that there was a water basin inside the feature during the neogene period , after the impact in september 2007 , a report published in nature proposed an origin for the asteroid that created the chicxulub crater they proposed that the '' chicxulub asteroid '' was also a member of this group according to bottke , the chicxulub impactor was a fragment of a much larger parent body about across , with the other impacting body being around in diameter this makes an asteroid from this family highly improbable to be the asteroid that created the chicxulub crater , as typically the process of resonance and collision of an asteroid takes many tens of millions of years in 2010 , another hypothesis was offered which implicated the newly discovered asteroid 354p/linear , a member of the flora family of asteroids , as a possible remnant cohort of the k/pg impactor . chicxulub and mass extinction the impact associated with the crater is thus implicated in the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event , including the worldwide extinction of non-avian dinosaurs chicxulub is the only known earth crater with a remaining impact peak ring , but it is under of sediment during april and may 2016 , a joint iodp-icdp mission specific platform expedition no the granite samples were also found to be lighter and weaker than normal granite , a result of the shock and extreme conditions of the impact also related to this tsunami was a dense dinosaur bone bed on the cretaceous–paleogene boundary found in patagonia
