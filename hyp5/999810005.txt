thumb modern mmus typically divide the virtual address space ( the range of addresses used by the processor ) into pages , each having a size which is a power of 2 , usually a few kilobytes , but they may be much larger the bottom bits of the address ( the offset within a page ) are left unchanged the upper address bits are the virtual page numbers most mmus use an in-memory table of items called a '' page table '' , containing one '' page table entry '' ( pte ) per page , to map virtual page numbers to physical page numbers in main memory an associative cache of ptes is called a translation lookaside buffer ( tlb ) and is used to avoid the necessity of accessing the main memory every time a virtual address is mapped other mmus may have a private array of memory or registers that hold a set of page table entries the physical page number is combined with the page offset to give the complete physical address sometimes , a pte prohibits access to a virtual page , perhaps because no physical random access memory has been allocated to that virtual page if no ram is free , it may be necessary to choose an existing page ( known as a '' victim '' ) , using some replacement algorithm , and save it to disk ( a process called '' paging '' ) typically , an operating system assigns each program its own virtual address space after blocks of memory have been allocated and freed , the free memory may become fragmented ( discontinuous ) so that the largest contiguous block of free memory may be much smaller than the total amount with virtual memory , a contiguous range of virtual addresses can be mapped to several non-contiguous blocks of physical memory ; this non-contiguous allocation is one of the benefits of paging most modern systems divide memory into pages that are in size , often with the capability to use so called huge pages of or in size ( often both variants are possible ) page translations are cached in a translation lookaside buffer ( tlb ) they are : ; p0 space : used for general-purpose per-process memory such as heaps thus , there is effectively a two-level tree , allowing applications to have sparse memory layout without wasting a lot of space on unused page table entries oses which implement paging must find some way to emulate the accessed bit if they are to operate efficiently arm architecture-based application processors implement an mmu defined by arm 's virtual memory system architecture the current architecture defines ptes for describing and pages , sections and super-sections ; legacy versions also defined a tiny page tlb updates are performed automatically by page table walking hardware 1965 , included an mmu called a dynamic address translation ( dat ) box this reduces overhead for the os , which would otherwise need to propagate accessed and dirty bits from the page tables to a more physically oriented data structure starting in august , 1972 , the ibm system/370 has a similar mmu , although it initially supported only a 24-bit virtual address space rather than the 32-bit virtual address space of the system/360 model 67 a vpn2 has a global status bit and an os assigned id which participates in the virtual address tlb entry match , if the global status bit is set to zero a pfn stores the physical address without the page mask bits a tlb refill exception is generated when there are no entries in the tlb that match the mapped virtual address mips32 and mips32r2 support 32 bits of virtual address space and up to 36 bits of physical address space mips64 supports up to 64 bits of virtual address space and up to 59 bits of physical address space it includes the original sun 1 memory management unit that provides address translation , memory protection , memory sharing and memory allocation for multiple processes running on the cpu the mmu consists of a context register , a segment map and a page map g1 chips do not search for page table entries , but they do generate the hash , with the expectation that an os will search the standard hash table via software on chips that make this optional or do not support it at all , the os may choose to use a tree-based page table exclusively in all levels of the page table , the page table entry includes a nx bit bit first , in the mapping of virtual memory addresses , instead of needing an mmu , the mcp systems are descriptor-based descriptors are read only to user processes and may only be updated by the system ( hardware or mcp )
