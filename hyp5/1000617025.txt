veneration towards those who were considered holy began in early christianity , with the martyrs first being given special honor in catholic and orthodox theology , veneration is a type of honor distinct from the latria , which is due to god alone according to mark miravelle , of the franciscan university of steubenville , the english word '' worship '' has been associated with both veneration and adoration : as st thomas aquinas once explained , adoration , which is known as latria in classical theology , is the worship and homage that is rightly offered to god alone it is the worship of the creator that god alone deserves veneration , known as dulia in classical theology , is the honor and reverence appropriately due to the excellence of a created person we must make a further clarification regarding the use of the term “ worship ” in relation to the categories of adoration and veneration historically , schools of theology have used the term “ worship ” as a general term which included both adoration and veneration they would distinguish between “ worship of adoration ” and “ worship of veneration ” the word “ worship ” ( in a similar way to how the liturgical term “ cult ” is traditionally used ) was not synonymous with adoration , but could be used to introduce either adoration or veneration hence catholic sources will sometimes use the term “ worship ” not to indicate adoration , but only the worship of veneration given to mary and the saints church theologians have long adopted the terms latria for the type of worship due to god alone , and dulia and proskynesis for the veneration given to angels , saints , relics and icons images , veneration of , catholic and orthodox theologies also include the term hyperdulia for the type of veneration specifically paid to mary , mother of jesus , in catholic and orthodox traditions now , the roman catholic tradition has a well established philosophy for the veneration of the virgin mary via the field of mariology with pontifical schools such as the marianum specifically devoted to this task protestant theology usually denies that any real distinction between veneration and worship can be made , and claims that the practice of veneration distracts the christian soul from its true object , the worship of god while orthodox and organized judaism do not countenance the veneration of saints per se , veneration and pilgrimage to burial sites of holy jewish leaders is an ancient part of the tradition
