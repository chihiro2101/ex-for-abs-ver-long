the chinese concept of the world was largely a division between the civilized world and the barbarian world and there was little concept of the belief that chinese interests were served by a powerful chinese state the key factor in european nationalism was tradition – some of the newly manufactured – of a cultural identity based primarily on language and ethnicity chinese nationalism was rooted in the long historic tradition of china as the center of the world , in which all other states were offshoots and owed some sort of deference ethnic nationalism was , in any case , unacceptable to the ruling manchu elitethey were foreigners who conquered china and maintained their own language and traditions the discussion of modern chinese nationalism has dominated many political and intellectual debates since the late nineteenth century over the first half of the twentieth century , chinese nationalism has constituted a crucial part of many political ideologies , including the anti-manchuism during 1911 revolution , the anti-imperialism sentiment of the may fourth movement in 1919 , and the maoist thoughts that guided the communist revolution in 1949 the origin of modern chinese nationalism can be traced back to the intellectual debate on race and nation in late nineteenth century after the collapse of the qing regime and the founding of the republic of china in 1911 , concerns of both domestic and international threat made the role of racism decline , while anti-imperialism became the new dominant ideology of chinese nationalism over the 1910s while intellectuals and elites advocated their distinctive thoughts on chinese nationalism , political scientist chalmers johnson has pointed out that most of these ideas had very little to do with china 's majority population -- the chinese peasantry he thus proposes to supplement the chinese communist ideology in the discussion of chinese nationalism , which he labels '' peasant nationalism '' chinese nationalism in the early twentieth century was primarily based on anti-manchurism , an ideology that was prevalent among chinese revolutionaries from late nineteenth century to the turn of the twentieth century after qing 's defeat in the first sino-japanese war , reformers and intellectuals debated how to strengthen the nation , the discussion of which centered on the issue of race liang qichao , a late qing reformist who participated in the hundred days ' reform of 1898 , contended that the boundary between han and man must be erased ( ping man-han zhi jie ) liang 's thought was based on the idea of racial competition , a concept originating from social darwinism that believed only superior races would survive whereas the inferior races were bound to extinct liang 's critique of the qing court and the man-han relations laid the foundation for anti-manchuism , an ideology that early republican revolutionaries advocated in their efforts to overthrow the qing dynasty and found a new republic in his writing “ revolutionary army , ” zou rong , an active chinese revolutionary at the turn of the twentieth century , demanded a revolution education for the han people who were suffering from the oppression of the manchu rule wang jingwei , a chinese revolutionary who later became an important figure in the kuomintang , also believed that the manchus were an inferior race wang contended that a state consisting of a single race would be superior to those multiracial ones since the han had asserted its dominant role in chinese nationalism , the manchus had to be either absorbed or eradicated historian prasenjit duara summarized this by stating that the republican revolutionaries primarily drew on the international discourse of '' racist evolutionism '' to envision a '' racially purified china while both japan and russia were encroaching china , the newly born republic also faced ethnic movements in mongolia and tibet which claimed themselves to be part of the qing empire rather than the republic of china the wartime alliance of the chinese peasantry and the ccp manifests how the nationalist ideology of the ccp , or the peasant nationalism , reinforced the desire of the chinese to save and build a strong nation during the 1960s and 1970s , chinese nationalism within mainland china became mixed with the rhetoric of marxism , and nationalistic rhetoric become in large part subsumed into internationalist rhetoric on the other hand , chinese nationalism in taiwan was primarily about preserving the ideals and lineage of sun yat-sen , the party he founded , the kuomintang ( kmt ) , and anti-communism while the definition of chinese nationalism differed in the republic of china ( roc ) and the people 's republic of china ( prc ) , both are adamant in claiming chinese territories such as the senkaku islands and the nine-dash line in the south china sea defining the relationship between ethnicity and the chinese identity has been a very complex issue throughout chinese history in the 17th century , with the help of ming chinese rebels , the manchus conquered china proper and set up the qing dynasty it was during this time that the concept of han chinese came into existence as a means of describing the majority of chinese ethnicity due to sinicization in early chinese history furthermore , it was also influenced by the fate of multi-ethnic states such as austria-hungary and the ottoman empire it also became a very powerful force during the japanese occupation of coastal china during the 1930s and 1940s and the atrocities committed then chinese muslims have played an important role in chinese nationalism chinese muslims are sinophones , speaking chinese and practicing confucianism he even ordered the chinese flag to be saluted during prayer , and that all imams in ningxia preach chinese nationalism hu songshan harshly criticized those who were non-patriotic and those who taught anti-nationalist thinking , saying that they were fake muslims ma fuxiang preached unity of all chinese people , and even non-han chinese people such as tibetans and mongols to stay in china 167 ma fuxiang was loyal to the chinese government , and crushed muslim rebels when ordered to ma fuxiang had served under the chinese muslim general dong fuxiang , and fought against the foreigners during the boxer rebellion chinese muslim students returning from study abroad , from places such as al-azhar university in egypt , learned about nationalism and advocated chinese nationalism at home chinese muslims believed that their '' watan '' was the whole of the republic of china , non-muslims included general bai chongxi , the warlord of guangxi , and a member of the kuomintang , presented himself as the protector of islam in china and harbored muslim intellectuals fleeing from the japanese invasion in guangxi ma bufang , a chinese muslim general who was part of the kuomintang , supported chinese nationalism and tolerance between the different chinese ethnic groups the japanese attempted to approach him however their attempts at gaining his support were unsuccessful ma bufang presented himself as a chinese nationalist who fought against western imperialism to the people of china in order to deflect criticism by opponents that his government was feudal and oppressed minorities like tibetans and buddhist mongols in xinjiang , the chinese muslim general ma hushan supported chinese nationalism the chinese muslims even forced the uighur carpet industry at khotan to change its design to chinese versions ma hushan proclaimed his loyalty to nanjing , denounced sheng shicai as a soviet puppet , and fought against soviet invasion in 1937 the 9th panchen lama , thubten choekyi nyima , was considered extremely '' pro-chinese '' , according to official chinese sources one unified common goal of current chinese nationalists is the unification of mainland china and taiwan as a result , ethnic chinese in regional countries such as malaysia , singapore and thailand , as well as in the western world such as australia , canada and the united states were sharply divided over the concept of ethnic chinese from the concept of '' political chinese '' with opening of china under deng xiaoping and the death of mao zedong , the prc 's attitude toward overseas chinese became much more favourable , and overseas chinese were seen as a source of capital and expertise in recent years , there have been summer camps which have been set up by organizations such as the china institute and confucius institute in which overseas chinese youths may attend to learn first-hand about its own ancestral chinese culture as well as the language some critics states that chinese nationalism is '' inherently backward '' such as nationalism in every country and is therefore incompatible with a modern state chinese nationalism ( m , e
