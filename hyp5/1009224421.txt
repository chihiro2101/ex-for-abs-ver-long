the names somatotropin ( sth ) or somatotropic hormone refer to the growth hormone produced naturally in animals and extracted from carcasses hormone extracted from human cadavers is abbreviated hgh the main growth hormone produced by recombinant dna technology has the approved generic name ( inn ) somatropin and the brand name humatrope , and is properly abbreviated rhgh in the scientific literature genes for human growth hormone , known as growth hormone 1 ( somatotropin ; pituitary growth hormone ) and growth hormone 2 ( placental growth hormone ; growth hormone variant ) , are localized in the q22-24 region of chromosome 17 and are closely related to somatomammotropin ( also known as placental lactogen ) genes gh , human chorionic somatomammotropin , and prolactin belong to somatotropin family with growth-promoting and lactogenic activity the major isoform of the human growth hormone is a protein of 191 amino acids and a molecular weight of 22,124 daltons despite marked structural similarities between growth hormone from different species , only human and old world monkey growth hormones have significant effects on the human growth hormone receptor several molecule isoforms of gh exist in the pituitary gland and are released to blood furthermore , these variants circulate partially bound to a protein ( growth hormone-binding protein , ghbp ) , which is the truncated part of the growth hormone receptor , and an acid-labile subunit ( als ) secretion of growth hormone ( gh ) in the pituitary is regulated by the neurosecretion nuclei of the hypothalamus these cells release the peptides growth hormone-releasing hormone ( ghrh or somatocrinin ) and somatostatin ( ghih or somatostatin ) into the hypophyseal portal venous blood surrounding the pituitary somatotropic cells in the anterior pituitary gland then synthesize and secrete gh in a pulsatile manner , in response to these stimuli by the hypothalamus the largest and most predictable of these gh peaks occurs about an hour after onset of sleep with plasma levels of 13 to 72 & nbsp ; ng/ml additional analysis of the pulsatile profile of gh described in all cases less than 1 & nbsp ; ng/ml for basal levels while maximum peaks were situated around 10-20 & nbsp ; ng/ml young adolescents secrete gh at the rate of about 700 μg/day , while healthy adults secrete gh at the rate of about 400 μg/day effects of growth hormone on the tissues of the body can generally be described as anabolic ( building up ) thus , gh exerts some of its effects by binding to receptors on target cells , where it activates the mapk/erk pathway gh also stimulates , through the jak-stat signaling pathway , the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 ( igf-1 , formerly known as somatomedin c ) , a hormone homologous to proinsulin the liver is a major target organ of gh for this process and is the principal site of igf-1 production prolonged gh excess thickens the bones of the jaw , fingers and toes , resulting heaviness of the jaw and increased size of digits , referred to as acromegaly in some circumstances , focused radiation or a gh antagonist such as pegvisomant may be employed to shrink the tumor or block function other drugs like octreotide ( somatostatin agonist ) and bromocriptine ( dopamine agonist ) can be used to block gh secretion because both somatostatin and dopamine negatively inhibit ghrh-mediated gh release from the anterior pituitary gh is used as replacement therapy in adults with gh deficiency of either childhood-onset or adult-onset ( usually as a result of an acquired pituitary tumor ) gh can be used to treat conditions that produce short stature but are not related to deficiencies in gh examples of other causes of shortness often treated with gh are turner syndrome , chronic kidney failure , prader–willi syndrome , intrauterine growth restriction , and severe idiopathic short stature higher ( '' pharmacologic '' ) doses are required to produce significant acceleration of growth in these conditions , producing blood levels well above normal ( '' physiologic '' ) gh has also been used experimentally in patients with short bowel syndrome to lessen the requirement for intravenous total parenteral nutrition prior to its production by recombinant dna technology , growth hormone used to treat deficiencies was extracted from the pituitary glands of cadavers in 1985 , biosynthetic human growth hormone replaced pituitary-derived human growth hormone for therapeutic use in the u.s
