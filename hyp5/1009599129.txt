the word tsetse means '' fly '' in tswana , a bantu language of southern africa recently , tsetse without the fly has become more common in english , particularly in the scientific and development communities during world war ii , a de havilland antisubmarine aircraft was known as the 'tsetse ' mosquito the biology of tsetse is relatively well understood by entomology they have been extensively studied because of their medical , veterinary , and economic importances , because the flies can be raised in a laboratory , and because they are relatively large , facilitating their analysis tsetse flies can be seen as independent individuals in three forms : as third-instar larvae , pupae and as adults tsetse first become separate from their mothers during the third larval instar , during which they have the typical appearance of maggots tsetse pupae are under long within the puparial shell , tsetse complete the last two larval instars and the pupal stage at the end of the pupal stage , tsetse emerge as adult flies procyclins are proteins developed in the surface coating of trypanosomes whilst in their tsetse fly vector other forms of human trypanosomiasis also exist but are not transmitted by tsetse animal trypanosomiasis , also called nagana when it occurs in cattle or horses or sura when it occurs in domestic pigs , is caused by several trypanosome species other forms of animal trypanosomiasis are also known from other areas of the globe , caused by different species of trypanosomes and transmitted without the intervention of the tsetse fly the tsetse fly vector ranges mostly in the central part of africa economic guidelines for strategic planning of tsetse and trypanosomiasis control in west africa , by a.p.m area-wide interventions against the tsetse and trypanosomosis problem appear more efficient and profitable if sufficiently large areas , with high numbers of cattle , can be covered targeting an entire tsetse population that is preferably genetic isolation another early technique involved complete removal of brush and woody vegetation from an area tsetse tend to rest on the trunks of trees so removing woody vegetation made the area inhospitable to the flies preventing regrowth of woody vegetation requires continuous clearing efforts , which is only practical where large human populations are present the sustainable removal of the tsetse fly is in many cases the most cost-effective way of dealing with the t & t problem resulting in major economic benefits for subsistence farmers in rural areas a '' tsetse suitability index '' was developed from insect population growth , climate and geospatial data to simulate the fly 's population steady state one conventional argument is that the tsetse fly made it difficult to use draught animals he published : a naturalist on lake victoria , with an account of sleeping sickness and the tse-tse fly ; 1920
