finally , the sheffield cutlers obtained an act of parliament in 1726 to improve the river up to tinsley the dutch river was difficult to navigate , and in 1793 , the stainforth and keadby canal was authorised , to provide a link from the don at stainforth to the trent at keadby the dearne and dove canal was also authorised in 1793 , from swinton to barnsley , and was again under don navigation control , since most of the shareholders were also shareholders in the don a canal from tinsley into sheffield was delayed for years by opposition from the don navigation , but was authorised in 1815 and opened in 1819 they bought out the dearne and dove canal in 1846 , and acquired the sheffield canal from the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway in 1848 , which , as the sheffield and lincolnshire junction railway , a predecessor and constituent company , had bought it in 1846 they then amalgamated with the south yorkshire , doncaster and goole railway in 1850 , to become the south yorkshire railway and river dun company with the manchester ship canal under construction , and other large canals being proposed , a committee was formed to investigate a new canal from sheffield to the sea their report , presented in october 1888 , suggested that the existing locks on the route from sheffield to keadby were inadequate , but that the waterway could be upgraded to take 300- to 500-ton boats by building new locks alongside the old , without disrupting traffic the sheffield and south yorkshire canal company limited was formed in november 1888 , with a capital of Â£30,000 , to promote this new venture and obtain the necessary act of parliament the intent was to rebuild the don and the stainforth and keadby routes to allow 300- or 400-ton barges to be used , and to develop coal-handling facilities at keadby so that it would rival goole on the aire and calder navigation in addition , the dearne and dove canal would be dredged , so that tom pudding , like those on the aire and calder , could be used for the transport of coal the rest could be paid in shares in the new company , which would give the railway places on the board unless the canal company bought all of the shares back this was enshrined in a new act of parliament obtained on 31 july 1893 , but the clause about railway representation meant that the aire and calder declined to purchase any shares , and the company struggled to raise the capital they were also faced with the prospect of funding their half of the new junction canal , to provide the connection with the aire and calder navigation today the system is open to navigation throughout the main line , the stainforth and keadby and new junction canals , and is mostly used for leisure boating
