the mistle thrush was first described by carl linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of systema naturae under its current scientific name turdus is the latin for '' thrush '' , and viscivorus , '' mistletoe eater '' , comes from viscum '' mistletoe '' and vorare , '' to devour '' the bird 's liking for mistletoe berries is also indicated by its english name , '' mistle '' being an old name for the plant there are more than 60 species of medium to large thrushes in the genus turdus , characterised by rounded heads , longish pointed wings , and usually melodious songs a mitochondrial dna study identified the mistle thrush 's closest relatives as the similarly plumaged song and chinese thrushes ; these three species are early offshoots from the eurasian lineage of turdus thrushes after they spread north from africa they are less closely related to other european thrush species such as the blackbird ( t at least eight subspecies have been proposed , but the differences between them are mainly clinal , with birds being paler and less densely spotted in the east of the range turdus viscivorus viscivorus , named by linnaeus , 1758 , the nominate subspecies mistle thrush fossils have been found in pleistocene deposits from poland and sicily the mistle thrush is the largest thrush native to europe the nominate subspecies measures in length , with a wingspan juveniles are similar to adults , but they have paler upperparts with creamy centres to many of the feathers and smaller spots on the yellowish underparts by their first winter they are very similar to adults , but the underparts are usually more buff-toned it is paler grey above and whiter below , with fewer black spots birds of intermediate appearance are seen west of the ob river where the range overlaps with viscivorus adults have a full moult after breeding , beginning between late may and the end of june , and completed by early october the long-tailed thrush has olive-toned upperparts , bars on its breast and two wing bars juvenile mistle thrushes are superficially similar to white 's thrush , but that species has golden-yellow plumage , scalloped underparts and a distinctive underwing pattern the song is given from a treetop or other elevated position mainly from november to early june the male is most vocal in the early morning , and its tendency to sing after , and sometimes during , wet and windy weather led to the old name '' stormcock '' the song may be heard in any month , although it is uncommon from july to august while the thrush is moulting there is also a squeaky tuk contact call the mistle thrush breeds in much of europe and temperate asia , although it is absent from the treeless far north , and its range becomes discontinuous in southeast europe , turkey and the middle east in these warmer southern areas , it tends to be found in the milder uplands and coastal regions the mistle thrush is a partial migrant : birds from the north and east of the range wintering in the milder areas of europe and north africa scandinavian and russian birds start moving south from mid-september onwards , most birds wintering in europe , western turkey and the middle east the mistle thrush is found in a wide range of habitats containing trees , including forests , plantations , hedges and town parks in germany and elsewhere in central europe , it was found only in coniferous forest until the mid-1920s when its range rapidly expanded , first into farmland , and then to suburbs and urban parks this was the first record for this species in north america the mistle thrush is quite terrestrial , hopping with its head held up and body erect ; when excited , it will flick its wings and tail mistle thrushes breed in the year subsequent to their hatching ; they are monogamous and stay as a pair throughout the year in areas where they are not migratory the male will attack intruders into its breeding area , including birds of prey and corvids , and sometimes cats or humans life expectancy is typically three years , but the maximum age recorded from bird ringing recoveries is 21 & nbsp ; years and 3 & nbsp ; months for a bird shot in switzerland adult survival , clutch size and fledging success are all lower in arable landscapes than in areas with extensive pasture the song of the mistle thrush is also described in thomas hardy 's '' darkling thrush '' and edward thomas 's '' the thrush '' '' holm thrush '' , '' hollin cock '' and '' holm cock '' are based on obsolete names for the holly tree , which may be defended by the thrush in winter for its berries
