every color-managed device requires a personalized table , or '' color profile , '' which characterizes the color response of that particular device each color profile describes these colors relative to a standardized set of reference colors ( the '' profile connection space '' ) color-managed software then uses these standardized profiles to translate color from one device to another this is usually performed by a color management module ( cmm ) often a step called linearization is performed first , to undo the effect of gamma correction that was done to get the most out of limited 8-bit color paths instruments used for measuring device colors include colorimeters and spectrophotometers color management is sometimes sidestepped by calibrating devices to a common standard color space such as srgb ; when such calibration is done well enough , no color translations are needed to get all devices to handle colors consistently this avoidance of the complexity of color management was one of the goals in the development of srgb the icc standard permits the exchange of output device characteristics and color spaces in the form of metadata using a large ( gamut ) working space will lead to posterization , while using a small working space will lead to clipping color transformation , or color space conversion , is the transformation of the representation of a color from one color space to another transforming profiled color information to different output devices is achieved by referencing the profile data into a standard color space by ensuring that the reference color space covers the many possible colors that humans can see , this concept allows one to exchange colors between many different color output devices since 1997 color management in windows is available through an icc color management system ( icm ) gamma correction color chart digital printing icc profile international color consortium it8 linux color management
