in general terms , the procedure for an open appendectomy is : antibiotics are given immediately if signs of actual sepsis are seen ( in appendicitis , sepsis and bacteremia usually only occurs at some point after rupture , once peritonitis has begun ) , or if there is reasonable suspicion that the appendix has ruptured ( e.g , on imaging ) or if the onset of peritonitis- which will lead to full sepsis if not quickly treated- is suspected ; otherwise , a single dose of prophylactic intravenous antibiotics is given immediately before surgery otherwise , the incision is made over mcburney 's point ( one-third of the way from the anterior superior iliac spine to the navel ) , which represents the most common position of the base of the appendix the standardization of an incision is not best practice when performing an appendectomy given that the appendix is a mobile organ a physical exam should be performed prior to the operation and the incision should be chosen based on the point of maximal tenderness to palpation many surgeons have attempted to reduce incisional morbidity and improve cosmetic outcomes in laparoscopic appendectomy by using fewer and smaller ports have described variants of an sling-based single-port laparoscopic appendectomy with good clinical results also , a trend is increasing towards single-incision laparoscopic surgery ( sils ) , using a special multiport umbilical trocar the equipment used for sils is familiar to surgeons already doing laparoscopic surgery appendicitis is the most common emergent general surgery related problem to arise during pregnancy if appendicitis develops in a pregnant woman , an appendectomy is usually performed and should not harm the fetus schwartz book of general surgery the risk of fetal death in the perioperative period after an appendectomy for early acute appendicitis is 3 to 5 % the risk of fetal death is 20 % in perforated appendicitis thumb thumb a study from 2010 found that the average hospital stay for people with appendicitis in the united states was 1.8 days in the case of a laparoscopic operation , the patient has three stapled scars of about an inch ( 2.5 & nbsp ; cm ) in length , between the navel and pubic hair line patients with complicated appendicitis ( perforated appendicitis ) are more likely to develop a ssi , abdominal abscess , or pelvic abscess during the post-operative period on september 13 , 1980 , kurt semm performed the first laparoscopic appendectomy opening up the path for a much wider application of minimally invasive surgery
