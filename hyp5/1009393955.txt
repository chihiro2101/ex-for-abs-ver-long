linguistic anthropology emerged from the development of three distinct paradigms though they developed sequentially , all three paradigms are still practiced today language as culture in u.s . first paradigm : anthropological linguistics the first paradigm is known as anthropological linguistics the themes include : grammatical description , linguistic typology and linguistic relativity the second paradigm can be marked by the switch from anthropological linguistics to linguistic anthropology , signalling a more anthropological focus on the study this term was preferred by dell hymes , who was also responsible , with john gumperz , for the idea of ethnography of communication the term linguistic anthropology reflected hymes ' vision for the future , where language would be studied in the context of the situation , and relative to the community speaking it this new era would involve many new technological developments , such as mechanical recording hymes had many revolutionary contributions to linguistic anthropology , the first of which was a new unit of analysis unlike the first paradigm , which focused on linguistic tools like measuring of phonemes and morphemes , the second paradigm 's unit of analysis was the '' speech event '' a speech event is an event defined by speech occurring during it ( ex hymes also pioneered a linguistic anthropological approach to ethnopoetics hymes had hoped that this paradigm would link linguistic anthropology more to anthropology however , hymes ' ambition backfired as the second paradigm marked a distancing of the sub-discipline from the rest of anthropology . third paradigm : anthropological issues studied via linguistic methods and data the third paradigm , which began in the late 1980s , refocused on anthropology by providing a linguistic approach to anthropological issues rather than focusing on exploring language , third paradigm anthropologists focus on studying culture with linguistic tools contemporary linguistic anthropology continues research in all three of the paradigms described above : documentation of languages , study of language through context , and study of identity through linguistic means linguistic anthropologist don kulick has done so in relation to identity , for example , in a series of settings , first in a village called gapun in northern papua new guinea language shift and cultural reproduction : socialization , self and syncretism in a papua new guinea village in later work , kulick demonstrates that certain loud speech performances in brazil called um esc√¢ndalo , brazilian travesti ( roughly , 'transvestite ' ) sex workers shame clients the travesti community , the argument goes , ends up at least making a powerful attempt to transcend the shame the larger brazilian public might try to foist off on them , again by loud public discourse and other modes of performance scandalous acts : the politics of shame among brazilian travesti

language socialization of kaluli children they discovered that the processes of enculturation and socialization do not occur apart from the process of language acquisition , but that children acquire language and culture together in what amounts to an integrated process in many societies caregivers hold a child facing outward so as to orient it to a network of kin whom it must learn to recognize early in life ochs and schieffelin demonstrated that members of all societies socialize children both to and through the use of language schieffelin 's more recent research has uncovered the

records of the language - these records could be field notes and audio or video recordings language revitalization is the practice of bringing a language back into common use encouraging those who already know the language to use it , increasing the domains of usage , and increasing the overall prestige of the language are all components of reclamation
