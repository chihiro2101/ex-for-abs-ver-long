'happiness ' is the subject of debate on usage and meaning , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy states that '' an important project in the philosophy of happiness is simply getting clear on what various writers are talking about dan haybron ( , ; '' i would suggest that when we talk about happiness , we are actually referring , much of the time , to a complex emotional phenomenon happiness as emotional well-being concerns your emotions and moods , more broadly your emotional condition as a whole being in good spirits , quick to laugh and slow to anger , at peace and untroubled , confident and comfortable in your own skin , engaged , energetic and full of life '' haybron has also used the term thymic , by which he means 'overall mood state ' in this context ; xavier landes has described a similar concept of mood for instance daniel kahneman has defined happiness as '' what i experience here and now '' in my view , it ’ s much more important for them to be satisfied , to experience life satisfaction , from the perspective of ‘ what i remember , ’ of the story they tell about their lives appraisal of life satisfaction , such as of quality of life for instance ruut veenhoven has defined happiness as '' overall appreciation of one 's life as-a-whole and in philosophy it is possible to speak of the happiness of a person ’ s life , or of their happy life , even if that person was in fact usually pretty miserable “ people don ’ t want to be happy the way i ’ ve defined the term – what i experience here and now see subjective well-being components of swb for instance sonja lyubomirsky has described happiness as “ the experience of joy , contentment , or positive well-being , combined with a sense that one 's life is good , meaningful , and worthwhile ” the how of happiness , lyubomirsky , 2007 eudaimonia , is a greek term variously translated as happiness , welfare , flourishing , and blessedness xavier landes has proposed that happiness include measures of subjective wellbeing , mood and eudaimonia 17 for positive affect , –.09 for negative affect ; and in the united states , essentially zero above 75,000 ( though quite strong at low income levels ) '' some have argued that it is misleading to use ‘ happiness ’ as a generic term to cover subjective well-being more generally answers to questions about the emotion of happiness relate well to what is happening at the moment evaluative answers , in response to questions about life as a whole , are supported by positive emotions , as noted above , but also driven much more , than are answers to questions about emotions , by a variety of life circumstances , including income , health and social trust helliwell , published online : 25 february 2017 , springer science+business media dordrecht 2017 happiness is no longer defined in relation to social life , but in terms of individual psychology happiness , however , remains a difficult term for moral philosophy in the nicomachean ethics , written in 350 bce , aristotle stated that happiness ( also being well and doing well ) is the only thing that humans desire for their own sake , unlike riches , honour , health or friendship for aristotle the term eudaimonia , which is translated as 'happiness ' or 'flourishing ' is an activity rather than an emotion or a state basically , if it is right , every living thing has a function , that which it uniquely does for aristotle human function is to reason , since it is that alone which humans uniquely do and performing one 's function well , or excellently , is good according to aristotle , the life of excellent rational activity is the happy life western ethics have made arguments for how humans should behave , either individually or collectively , based on the resulting happiness of such behavior utilitarians , such as john stuart mill and jeremy bentham , advocated the greatest happiness principle as a guide for ethical behavior '' he introduced the quasi-dystopic figure of the '' last man '' as a kind of thought experiment against the utilitarians and happiness-seekers these small , '' last men '' who seek after only their own pleasure and health , avoiding all danger , exertion , difficulty , challenge , struggle are meant to seem contemptible to nietzsche 's reader personal happiness aims can be effected by cultural factors hedonism appears to be more strongly related to happiness in more individualistic cultures for instance western concern about childhood being a time of happiness has occurred only since the 19th century not all cultures seek to maximise happiness , see the work of jeanne tsai see life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness meaning of '' happiness '' ref the meaning of the us declaration of independence phrase and some cultures are averse to happiness more mundane forms of happiness , such as acquiring wealth and maintaining good friendships , are also recognized as worthy goals for lay people ( see sukha ) he argued that if one did not feel satisfaction or pleasure in nourishing one 's '' vital force '' with '' righteous deeds '' , then that force would shrivel up ( mencius , 6a:15 2a:2 ) a popular teaching by rabbi nachman of breslov , a 19th-century chassidic rabbi , is '' mitzvah gedolah le'hiyot besimcha tamid , '' it is a great mitzvah ( commandment ) to always be in a state of happiness when a person is happy they are much more capable of serving god and going about their daily activities than when depressed or upset the primary meaning of '' happiness '' in various european languages involves good fortune , chance or happening augustine and thomas aquinas , man 's last end is happiness : '' all men agree in desiring the last end , which is happiness these laws , in turn , were according to aquinas caused by a first cause , or god according to aquinas , happiness consists in an '' operation of the speculative intellect '' : '' consequently happiness consists principally in such an operation , viz '' so : '' therefore the last and perfect happiness , which we await in the life to come , consists entirely in contemplation if you seek it , you wo n't find it , because seeking is the antithesis of happiness ” eckhart tolle , a new earth : awakening to your life 's purpose the scale requires participants to use absolute ratings to characterize themselves as happy or unhappy individuals , as well as it asks to what extent they identify themselves with descriptions of happy and unhappy individuals respondents are asked to think of a ladder , with the best possible life for them being a 10 , and the worst possible life being a 0 although these factors play a role in happiness , they do not all need to act in simultaneously to help one achieve an increase in happiness
