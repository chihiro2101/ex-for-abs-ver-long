distinct sizes and price range incense was burnt to counteract or obscure malodorous products of human habitation , but was widely perceived to also deter malevolent demons and appease the gods with its pleasant aroma the babylonians used incense while offering prayers to divining oracles incense burners have been found in the indus civilization ( 3300–1300 bce ) india also adopted techniques from east asia , adapting the formulation to encompass aromatic roots and other indigenous flora this was the first usage of subterranean plant parts in incense at around 2000 bce , ancient china began the use of incense in the religious sense , namely for worship holy smoke : the use of incense in the catholic church ( 2nd ed incense was used by chinese cultures from neolithic times and became more widespread in the xia , shang , and zhou dynasties it was n't until the muromachi period during the 15th and 16th century that incense appreciation ( kōdō ) spread to the upper and middle classes of japanese society a variety of materials have been used in making incense holy smoke : the use of incense in the catholic church the formula for charcoal-based incense is superficially similar to black powder , though it lacks the sulfur the dry binding powder usually comprises about 10 % of the dry weight in the finished incense incense is available in various forms and degrees of processing the two differ in their composition due to the former 's requirement for even , stable , and sustained burning indirect-burning incense , also called '' non-combustible incense '' , is an aromatic material or combination of materials , such as resins , that does not contain combustible material and so requires a separate heat source finer forms tend to burn more rapidly , while coarsely ground or whole chunks may be consumed very gradually , having less surface area in the west , the best known incense materials of this type are the resins frankincense and myrrh , likely due to their numerous mentions in the bible frankincense means '' pure incense '' , though in common usage refers specifically to the resin of the boswellia tree whole : the incense material is burned directly in raw form on top of coal embers powdered or granulated : incense broken into smaller pieces burns quickly and provides brief but intense odor much arabian incense , also called '' bukhoor '' or '' bakhoor '' , is of this type , and japan has a history of kneaded incense , called nerikō or awasekō , made using this method within the eastern orthodox christian tradition , raw frankincense is ground into a fine powder and then mixed with various sweet-smelling essential oils the glowing ember on the incense will continue to smoulder and burn the rest of the incense without further application of external heat or flame powder : the loose incense powder used for making indirect burning incense is sometimes burned without further processing paper : paper infused with resin or oils extracted from fragrant material , folded accordion style , is lit and blown out this type of incense is easily transported and stays fresh for extremely long periods image : hanoi_temple_of_literature_incense.jpg thumb upright joss sticks in the temple of literature , hanoi in hanoi , vietnam incense sticks may be termed joss sticks , especially in parts of east asia , south asia and southeast asia the word '' joss '' is derived from the latin deus ( god ) via the portuguese deos through the javanese dejos , through chinese pidgin english it is then cut into small cubes , coated with clay powder to prevent adhesion , and allowed to fully harden and dry oxidizer quantity : too little oxidizer in gum-bound incense may prevent the incense from igniting , while too much will cause the incense to burn too quickly , without producing fragrant smoke binder : water-soluble binders such as '' makko '' ensure that the incense mixture does not crumble when dry , dilute the mixture particulate size : the incense mixture has to be well pulverized with similarly sized particulates this form of incense requires the least skill and equipment to manufacture , since the blanks are pre-formed in china or south east asia the incense dough is then pressed into shaped forms to create cone and smaller coiled incense , or forced through a hydraulic press for solid stick incense incense produced in this fashion has a tendency to warp or become misshapen when improperly dried , and as such must be placed in climate-controlled rooms and rotated several times through the drying process in a process known as '' splitting the foot of the incense stick '' , the bamboo is trimmed to length , soaked , peeled , and split in halves until the thin sticks of bamboo have square cross sections of less than 3mm the sticks are then gently rolled and packed to maintain roundness while more incense powder is repeatedly tossed onto the sticks additional coatings of incense mixture can be applied after each period of successive drying compression : a damp powder is mechanically formed around a cored stick by compression , similar to the way uncored sticks are formed indirect-burning incense is burned directly on top of a heat source or on a hot metal plate in a censer or thurible the makkō is lit and the incense mixture is burned on top for direct-burning incense , the tip or end of the incense is ignited with a flame or other heat source until the incense begins to turn into ash at the burning end for over two thousand years , the chinese have used incense in religious ceremonies , ancestor veneration , traditional chinese medicine , and daily life along with the introduction of buddhism in china came calibrated incense sticks and incense clocks the regular burning of direct-burning incense has been used for chronological measurement in incense clocks '' although several studies have not shown a link between incense and lung cancer , many other types of cancer have been directly linked to burning incense
