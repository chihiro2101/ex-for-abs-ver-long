the frankish carolingian empire and the frisians fought for control of the territory , until the franks gained control of the frisian coast in 719 dorestad flourished between the 7th century and the mid-9th century in the 7th century , it was clear that dorestad had the potential to become a major port as a result , the franks and the frisians fought over control of the township the franks won out at the end of the 7th century and closely monitored the growth of dorestad , which led to dorestad 's economic expansion via international trade and the establishment of a mint in the upper town it is assumed that there was a toll as well as harbour fees , collected by the king 's representatives at dorestad over time , many coins have been discovered in the dorestad area , supporting the idea of rapid growth and control of the harbour as well as the presence of a mint it seems that the expansion of dorestad , lower town in particular , lasted until the early 9th century , when the strength of the international trade of luxury items was weakened by the rise of regional trade as a result , the franks slowly lost interest in the town and granted the church of utrecht responsibility over a sizeable portion of dorestad by the 830s , under the control of louis the pious , the expansion of the harbour had halted altogether , but coins continued to be minted for some time a division occurred in the frankish empire , and louis the pious was removed from the throne by his son as a result , louis the pious quickly took back dorestad and exiled his son to italy at this time , two things occurred in dorestad that led to its eventual downfall the second was that lothair i was stirring up trouble for the franks by encouraging viking raids on the frisian coast when he was exiled although dorestad was raided only once , in 834 , it seems that the town never fully recovered afterwards to protect the frisian coastline , frankish kings enlisted the help of the danes and appointed haraldr junior and his brother , hroerekr , to protect the emporium the franks allowed hroerekr to take control of the land as long as he protected the coast from viking invasions the coast was battered by viking attacks , but it seems that dorestad was left relatively unscathed while frankish defence was organized , that did not stop the danes from capturing dorestad and a large portion of the frisian coast in 850 the main reason that dorestad grew to be a lively trade city ( emporium ) was because of its location it was located at the crossing of two important river trade routes only the '' lower town '' was excavated by archaeologists as much of dorestad was eroded away by the river bend
