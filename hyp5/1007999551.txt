in biblical hebrew , the idea of repentance is represented by two verbs : שוב shuv ( to return ) and נחם nacham ( to feel sorrow ) in the new testament , the word translated as 'repentance ' is the greek word μετάνοια ( metanoia ) , '' after/behind one 's mind '' , which is a compound word of the preposition 'meta ' ( after , with ) , and the verb 'noeo ' ( to perceive , to think , the result of perceiving or observing ) metanoia is therefore primarily an after-thought , different from the former thought ; a change of mind and change of conduct , '' change of mind and heart '' , or , '' change of consciousness '' the doctrine of repentance as taught in the bible is a call to persons to make a radical turn from one way of life to another the repentance ( metanoia ) called for throughout the bible is a summons to a personal , absolute and ultimate unconditional surrender to god as sovereign 118-119 it is a change of mind that involves a conscious turning away from wrong actions , attitudes and thoughts that conflict with a godly lifestyle and biblical commands , and an intentional turning toward doing that which the bible says pleases god in repenting , one makes a complete change of direction ( 180° turn ) toward god says , '' thus saith the lord god ; repent , and turn yourselves from your idols ; and turn away your faces from all your abominations many rabbinic sources state that repentance is of paramount importance to the existence of this world , so that it was one of the seven provisions which god made before the creation talmud bavli , tractates pesahim 54a ; nedarim 39b ; midrash genesis rabbah 1 '' the holy one , blessed be his name , said to elijah , 'behold , the precious gift which i have bestowed on my world : though a man sins again and again , but returns in penitence , i will receive him buber , 25:158 ; midrash leviticus rabbah 7 ; talmud sanhedrin 43b ) sincere repentance is manifested when the same temptation to sin , under the same conditions , is ever after resolutely resisted ( talmud taanith 16a ; mishneh torah teshuva 2:3 ) according to jewish doctrine , repentance is the prerequisite of atonement talmud rosh hashan 18a ; mishneh torah teshuva 2:6 repentance and the day of atonement only absolve one from sins committed against god ; from sins against another person they absolve only when restitution has been made and the pardon of the offended party has been obtained jewish doctrine holds that it is never too late , even on the day of death , to return to god with sincere repentance for '' as the sea is always open for every one who wishes to cleanse himself , so are the gates of repentance always open to the sinner '' ( talmud pesachim 119a ; deuteronomy rabbah ii ) one view in the talmud holds that a repentant sinner attains a more exalted spiritual eminence than one who has never sinned ( talmud bava metsia 58b ; mishneh torah teshuva 8:8 ) repentance occupies a prominent position in all the ethical writings of the middle ages one of the most significant medieval works on repentance is '' shaarei teshuva , '' the '' gates of repentance '' by yonah gerondi in the hebrew bible , repentance generally leads to salvation in his pentecost sermon , peter the apostle called on people to repent , an appeal he repeated in his sermon at the beautiful gate of the temple : '' repent therefore , and return again to god , that your sins may be blotted out '' the protestant reformer john calvin wrote that repentance '' may be justly defined to be a true conversion of our life to god , proceeding from a serious fear of god , and consisting in the mortification of the flesh and of the old man , and in the vivification of the spirit '' at-tahriim 66:8 although repentance is considered as one act that can be used for cleansing the sins , the quran notes that all of the sins are forgiven with or without repentance except the state of shirk , i.e in mahayana buddhism , one of the most common repentance verses used for reflection is samantabhadra 's repentance verse taken from chapter 40 of the flower adornment sutra : for all the evil deeds i have done in the past created by my body , mouth , and mind , from beginningless greed , anger , and delusion , i now know shame and repent of them all
