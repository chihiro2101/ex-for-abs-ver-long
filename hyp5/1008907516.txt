despite the increase in ivr technology during the 1970s , the technology was considered complex and expensive for automating tasks in call centers the first commercial application of ivr was an order entry inventory control system designed and developed by steven schmidt in 1973 at that time , a system could store digitized speech on disk , play the appropriate spoken message , and process the human 's dtmf response as call centers began to migrate to multimedia in the late 1990s , companies started to invest in computer telephony integration ( cti ) with ivr systems ivr became vital for call centers deploying universal queuing and routing solutions and acted as an agent which collected customer data to enable intelligent routing decisions dtmf decoding and speech recognition are used to interpret the caller 's response to voice prompts ivr technology is also being introduced into automobile systems for hands-free operation this information can be used to profile the caller and route the call to an agent with a particular skill set ) interactive voice response can be used to front-end a call center operation by identifying the needs of the caller account numbers from the ivr are often compared to caller id data for security reasons and additional ivr responses are required if the caller id does not match the account record ivr speech recognition interactions ( call flows ) are designed using 3 approaches to prompt for and recognize user input : directed , open-ended , and mixed dialogue the open-ended prompt requires a greater degree of natural language processing to extract the relevant information from the phrase ( i.e despite the greater amount of data and processing required for open-ended prompts , they are more interactively efficient , as the prompts themselves are typically much shorter higher level ivr development tools are available to further simplify the application development process in telecommunications , an audio response unit ( aru ) is a device that provides synthesized voice responses to dtmf keypresses by processing calls based on ( a ) the call-originator input , ( b ) information received from a database , and ( c ) information in the incoming call , such as the time of day arus increase the number of information calls handled and provide consistent quality in information retrieval ivr systems are used to service high call volumes at lower cost when an ivr system answers multiple phone numbers , the use of dnis ensures that the correct application and language is executed ivrs will also log call detail information into its own database for auditing , performance report , and future ivr system enhancements cti can transfer relevant information about the individual customer and the ivr dialog from the ivr to the agent desktop using a screen pop , making for a more effective and efficient service by allowing low-literacy populations to interact with technology , ivr systems form an avenue to build technological skills in developing countries it may also be used to identify the caller , using technology such as iris scan or other biometric means it is also possible to deploy two-prong ivr services where the initial ivr application is used to route the call to the appropriate contact center companies have also been criticized for using ivr to reduce operational costs as the solution replaces the need for human agents to address voice inquiries
