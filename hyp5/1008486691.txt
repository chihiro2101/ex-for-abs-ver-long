in 1860 , joseph swan produced carbon fibers for the first time , for use in light bulbs in 1879 , thomas edison baked cotton threads or bamboo slivers at high temperatures carbonizing them into an all-carbon fiber filament used in one of the first incandescent light bulbs to be heated by electricity in 1880 , lewis latimer developed a reliable carbon wire filament for the incandescent light bulb , heated by electricity in 1958 , roger bacon created high-performance carbon fibers at the union carbide parma technical center located outside of cleveland , ohio this process proved to be inefficient , as the resulting fibers contained only about 20 % carbon and had low strength and stiffness properties this had produced a carbon fiber that contained about 55 % carbon 3,294,489 ) for producing a high carbon content ( 99 % ) fiber using rayon as a precursor the high potential strength of carbon fiber was realized in 1963 in a process developed by w the process was patented by the uk ministry of defence , then licensed by the british national research development corporation to three companies : rolls-royce , who were already making carbon fiber ; morganite ; and courtaulds morganite decided that carbon-fiber production was peripheral to its core business , leaving courtaulds as the only big uk manufacturer during the 1960s , experimental work to find alternative raw materials led to the introduction of carbon fibers made from a petroleum pitch derived from oil processing since the late 1970s , further types of carbon fiber yarn entered the global market , offering higher tensile strength and higher elastic modulus in turbostratic carbon fiber the sheets of carbon atoms are haphazardly folded , or crumpled , together turbostratic carbon fibers tend to have high ultimate tensile strength , whereas heat-treated mesophase-pitch-derived carbon fibers have high young 's modulus ( i.e carbon fiber filament yarns are used in several processing techniques : the direct uses are for prepregging , filament winding , pultrusion , weaving , braiding , etc carbon fiber yarn is rated by the linear density ( weight per unit length ; i.e each carbon filament is produced from a polymer such as polyacrylonitrile ( pan ) , rayon , or petroleum pitch the carbon can become further enhanced , as high modulus , or high strength carbon , by heat treatment processes basalt fiber carbon fiber reinforced polymer ceramic matrix composite carbon nanotube esd materials graphene
