recursion theory originated in the 1930s , with work of kurt gödel , alonzo church , rózsa péter , alan turing , stephen kleene , and emil post nowadays these are often considered as a single hypothesis , the church–turing thesis , which states that any function that is computable by an algorithm is a computable function although initially skeptical , by 1946 gödel argued in favor of this thesis : : '' tarski has stressed in his lecture ( and i think justly ) the great importance of the concept of general recursiveness ( or turing 's computability ) both reprintings have the following footnote added to the davis volume by gödel in 1965 : '' to be more precise : a function of integers is computable in any formal system containing arithmetic if and only if it is computable in arithmetic , where a function f is called computable in s if there is in s a computable term representing f ( p this result showed that there is no algorithmic procedure that can correctly decide whether arbitrary mathematical propositions are true or false the main form of computability studied in recursion theory was introduced by turing ( 1936 ) a function f from the natural numbers to themselves is a recursive or ( turing ) computable function if there is a turing machine that , on input n , halts and returns output f ( n ) the use of turing machines here is not necessary ; there are many other model of computation that have the same computing power as turing machines ; for example the mu-recursive function obtained from primitive recursion and the μ operator not every set of natural numbers is computable the halting problem , which is the set of ( descriptions of ) turing machines that halt on input 0 , is a well-known example of a noncomputable set the existence of many noncomputable sets follows from the facts that there are only countable set turing machines , and thus only countably many computable sets , but according to the cantor 's theorem , there are uncountable set sets of natural numbers although the halting problem is not computable , it is possible to simulate program execution and produce an infinite list of the programs that do halt the recursively enumerable sets , although not decidable in general , have been studied in detail in recursion theory these are not independent areas of research : each of these areas draws ideas and results from the others , and most recursion theorists are familiar with the majority of them recursion theory in mathematical logic has traditionally focused on relative computability , a generalization of turing computability defined using oracle turing machines , introduced by turing & nbsp ; ( 1939 ) an oracle turing machine is a hypothetical device which , in addition to performing the actions of a regular turing machine , is able to ask questions of an oracle , which is a particular set of natural numbers the oracle machine may only ask questions of the form '' is n in the oracle set ? '' thus an oracle machine with a noncomputable oracle will be able to compute sets that a turing machine without an oracle can not if a set a is turing reducible to a set b and b is turing reducible to a then the sets are said to have the same turing degree ( also called degree of unsolvability ) the turing degree of a set gives a precise measure of how uncomputable the set is but , many of these index sets are even more complicated than the halting problem these type of sets can be classified using the arithmetical hierarchy these hierarchy levels are defined inductively , σ n+1 contains just all sets which are recursively enumerable relative to σ n ; σ 1 contains the recursively enumerable sets the index sets given here are even complete for their levels , that is , all the sets in these levels can be many-one reduced to the given index sets harrington gave a further example of an automorphic property : that of the creative sets , the sets which are many-one equivalent to the halting problem gödel 's proofs show that the set of logical consequences of an effective first-order theory is a recursively enumerable set , and that if the theory is strong enough this set will be uncomputable he argues that turing 's terminology using the word '' computable '' is more natural and more widely understood than the terminology using the word '' recursive '' introduced by kleene since any two infinite computable sets are linked by a computable bijection , this proposal identifies all the infinite computable sets ( the finite computable sets are viewed as trivial ) according to rogers , the sets of interest in recursion theory are the noncomputable sets , partitioned into equivalence classes by computable bijections of the natural numbers
