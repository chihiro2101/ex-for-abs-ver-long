they believe '' that any true christian could point back in his or her life to an inner struggle with sin that culminated in a crisis and ultimately a decision to start a new , christ-centered life pietism did not die out in the 18th century , but was alive and active in the american deutscher evangelischer kirchenverein des westens ( german evangelical church society of the west , based in gravois , later german evangelical synod of north america and still later the evangelical and reformed church , a precursor of the united church of christ a discussion of some of the earlier pietist influence in the evangelical and reformed church can be found in dunn et al some vestiges of pietism were still present in 1957 at the time of the formation of the united church of christ in the 21st century pietism is still alive in groups inside the evangelical church in germany however , in the 19th century , there was a revival of confessional lutheran doctrine , known as the neo-lutheranism this movement focused on a reassertion of the identity of lutherans as a distinct group within the broader community of christians , with a renewed focus on the book of concord as a key source of lutheran doctrine scherer was professor of world mission and church history at the lutheran school of theology at chicago until his retirement heppe and ritschl – have included under it nearly all religious tendencies amongst protestants of the last three centuries in the direction of a more serious cultivation of personal piety than that prevalent in the various established churches some historians also speak of a later or modern pietism , characterizing thereby a party in the german church probably influenced by remains of spener 's pietism in westphalia , on the rhine , in württemberg , halle upon saale , and berlin the party , termed the repristination movement , was chiefly distinguished by its opposition to an independent scientific study of theology , its principal theological leader being hengstenberg and its chief literary organ , the evangelische kirchenzeitung pietism also had a strong influence on contemporary artistic culture in germany ; though unread today , the pietist johann georg hamann held a strong influence in his day pietist belief in the power of individual meditation on the divine – a direct , individual approach to the ultimate spiritual reality of god – was probably partly responsible for the uniquely metaphysical , idealistic nature of german romantic philosophy pietistic lutheranism entered sweden in the 1600s after the writings of johann arndt , philipp jakob spener , and august hermann francke became popular laestadian lutheranism , a form of pietistic lutheranism , continues to flourish in scandinavia , where church of sweden priest lars levi laestadius spearheaded the revival in the 19th century pietism , as a distinct movement in the german church , began with religious meetings at spener 's house ( collegia pietatis ) where he repeated his sermons , expounded passages of the new testament , and induced those present to join in conversation on religious questions in 1675 , spener published his pia desideria or earnest desire for a reform of the true evangelical church , the title giving rise to the term '' pietists '' while large numbers of orthodox lutheran theologians and pastors were deeply offended by spener 's book , many other pastors immediately adopted spener 's proposals the lectures , however , aroused the ill-will of the other theologians and pastors of leipzig , and francke and his friends left the city , and with the aid of christian thomasius and spener founded the new university of halle the main difference between the new pietistic lutheran school and the orthodox lutherans arose from the pietists ' conception of christianity as chiefly consisting in a change of heart and consequent holiness of life many pietists maintained that the new birth always had to be preceded by agonies of repentance , and that only a regenerated theologian could teach theology likewise , pietism challenged the orthodoxy via new media and formats : periodical journals gained importance versus the former pasquills and single thesis , traditional disputation was replaced by competitive debating , which tried to gain new knowledge instead of defending orthodox scholarship as a distinct movement , pietism had its greatest strength by the middle of the 18th century ; its very individualism in fact helped to prepare the way for the enlightenment ( aufklärung ) , which took the church in an altogether different direction yet some claim that pietism contributed largely to the revival of biblical studies in germany and to making religion once more an affair of the heart and of life and not merely of the intellect the king of prussia ordered the lutheran and reformed churches in prussia to unite ; they took the name '' evangelical '' as a name both groups had previously identified with this union movement spread through many german lands in the 1800s ( many immigrants to america , who agreed with the union movement , formed german evangelical lutheran and reformed congregations , later combined into the evangelical synod of north america , which is now a part of the united church of christ ) in the middle of the 19th century , lars levi laestadius spearheaded a pietist revival in scandinavia that upheld what came to be known as laestadian lutheranism , which is heralded today by the laestadian lutheran church as well as by several congregations within mainstream lutheran churches , such as the evangelical lutheran church of finland and the church of sweden after encountering a sami woman who experienced a conversion , laestadius had a similar experience that '' transformed his life and defined his calling '' in the united states , laestadian lutheran churches were formed for laestadian pietists laestadian lutherans observe the lutheran sacraments , holding classical lutheran theology on infant baptism and the real presence of christ in the eucharist , and also heavily emphasize confession laestadian lutherans gather in a central location for weeks at a time for summer services in which many young adults find their future spouses balmer says that : evangelicalism itself , i believe , is quintessentially north american phenomenon , deriving as it did from the confluence of pietism , presbyterianism , and the vestiges of puritanism similar to max weber 's famous claim on the link between protestant ethic and the capitalist economy , merton argued for a similar positive correlation between the rise of protestant pietism and early experimental science
