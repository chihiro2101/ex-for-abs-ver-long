aiws affects the sense of vision , sensation , touch , and hearing , as well as the perception of one 's own body image migraines , nausea , dizziness , and agitation are also commonly associated symptoms with alice in wonderland syndrome individuals with aiws can experience hallucinations or illusions of expansion , reduction or distortion of their own body image , such as microsomatognosia ( feeling that their own body or body parts are shrinking ) , or macrosomatognosia ( feeling that their body or body parts are growing taller or larger ) people with certain neurological diseases have also experienced similar visual hallucinations within the category of lilliputian hallucinations , patients may experience either micropsia or macropsia micropsia is an abnormal visual condition , usually occurring in the context of visual hallucination , in which the affected person sees objects as being smaller than they are in reality one 17-year-old boy described his odd symptoms by the following : '' quite suddenly objects appear small and distant or large and close for example , a corridor may appear to be very long , or the ground may appear too close a person affected by alice in wonderland syndrome may also lose a sense of time , a problem similar to the lack of spatial perspective brought on by visual distortion time may seem to pass very slowly , akin to an lsd experience , and the lack of time and space perspective can also lead to a distorted sense of velocity aiws can be caused by abnormal amounts of electrical activity resulting in abnormal blood flow in the parts of the brain that process visual perception and texture one hypothesis is that any condition resulting in a decrease in perfusion of the visual system or visual control centers of the brain may be responsible for the syndrome other theories suggest the syndrome is a result of unspecific cortical dysfunction ( e.g other theories suggest that distorted body image perceptions stem from within the parietal lobe throughout all the neuroimaging studies , several cortical regions ( including the temporoparietal junction within the parietal lobe , and the visual pathway , specifically the occipital lobe ) are associated with the development of alice in wonderland syndrome symptoms the role of migraines in alice in wonderland syndrome is still not understood , but both vascular and electrical theories have been suggested while there currently is no identified genetic locus/loci associated with alice in wonderland syndrome , observations suggest that a genetic component does exist symptoms of aiws do not appear to change in severity over the course of the syndrome , and though the symptoms may acutely impact the patient 's life while they are present , alice in wonderland syndrome typically resolves itself within weeks or months alice in wonderland syndrome was named after lewis carroll 's famous 19th-century novel alice 's adventures in wonderland there is some speculation that carroll may have written the story using his own direct experience with episodes of micropsia resulting from the numerous migraines he was known to suffer from
