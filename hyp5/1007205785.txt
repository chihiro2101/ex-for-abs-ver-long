although usually not cost-effective , glycerol can be produced by various routes from propene this epichlorohydrin is then hydrolyzed to give glycerol chlorine-free processes from propylene include the synthesis of glycerol from acrolein and propylene oxide : because of the large-scale production of biodiesel from fats , where glycerol is a waste product , the market for glycerol is depressed owing to oversupply , efforts are being made to convert glycerol to synthetic precursors , such as acrolein and epichlorohydrin in food and beverages , glycerol serves as a humectant , solvent , and sweetener , and may help preserve foods glycerol and water are used to preserve certain types of plant leaves it does not feed the bacteria that form plaques and cause dental cavities as a food additive , glycerol is labeled as e number e422 as used in foods , glycerol is categorized by the u.s due to this it is used widely in wound care products , including glycerin based hydrogel sheets for burns and other wound care it is approved for all types of wound care except third degree burns , and is used to package donor skin used in skin grafts glycerol is used in medical , pharmaceutical and personal care preparations , often as a means of improving smoothness , providing lubrication , and as a humectant glycerol is also used in blood banking to preserve red blood cells prior to freezing glycerol is a component of glycerin soap glycerol has also been incorporated as a component of bio-ink formulations in the field of bioprinting it is also used as an '' alcohol-free '' alternative to ethanol as a solvent in preparing herbal extractions alcohol-based tinctures can also have the alcohol removed and replaced with glycerol for its preserving properties fluid extract manufacturers often extract herbs in hot water before adding glycerol to make glycerites critical ) methodologies as opposed to standard passive '' tincturing '' methodologies that are better suited to alcohol ( 1928 ) glycerol and the glycols – production , properties and analysis glycerin , along with propylene glycol , is a common component of e-liquid , a solution used with electronic vaporizers ( electronic cigarettes ) in the laboratory , glycerol is a common component of solvents for enzyme reagents stored at temperatures below 0 & nbsp ; °c due to the freezing-point depression glycerol injections can be used as a simple test for liver damage , as its rate of absorption by the liver is considered an accurate measure of liver health blood glycerol levels in diabetic patients average three times higher than healthy controls glycerol has very low toxicity when ingested ; its ld50 oral dose for rats is 12600 & nbsp ; mg/kg and 8700 & nbsp ; mg/kg for mice on 4 may 2007 , the us food and drug administration advised all us makers of medicines to test all batches of glycerol for the toxic diethylene glycol
