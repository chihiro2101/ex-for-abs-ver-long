there are several theories about how and when gender identity forms , and studying the subject is difficult because children 's lack of language requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence john money suggested children might have awareness of and attach some significance to gender as early as 18 months to 2 years ; lawrence kohlberg argued that gender identity does not form until age 3 it is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age 3 a few authorities say it forms between ages 3–4 rather than precisely at age 3 , e.g soraka , sociology : cultural diversity in a changing world ( ed after age three , core gender identity is extremely difficult to change , j kleeman , the establishment of core gender identity in normal girls '' and attempts to reassign it can result in gender dysphoria coleman , developmental stages of the coming out process , in journal of homosexuality , 1982 : '' core gender and sex-role identities are well-formed by the age of 3 ( money & ehrhardt , 1972 ) this is believed because attempts to reassign gender identity after age 3 result in further gender dysphoria '' gender identity refinement extends into the fourth to sixth years of age , stein mt , zucker kj , dixon sd according to un agencies , discussions relating to comprehensive sexuality education raise awareness of topics , such as gender and gender identity although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood , many factors have been suggested as influencing its development biological factors that influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels 44 : '' when assigned and raised as boys , these genetic girls adopt a male gender identity and role , showing that a y chromosome is not necessary for gender development to proceed in a male direction when children are raised by individuals who adhere to stringent gender roles , they are more likely to behave in the same way , matching their gender identity with the corresponding stereotypical gender patterns he disagreed with the previous school of thought that gender was determined solely by biology he argued that infants are born a blank slate and a parent could be able to decide their babies ’ gender reimer grew up as a girl , dressing in girl clothes and surrounded by girl toys , but did not feel like a girl this response went against money 's hypothesis that biology had nothing to do with gender identity or human sexual orientation diamond had contributed to research involving pregnant rats that showed hormones played a major role in the behavior of different sexes the females in the litter also behaved like male rats and would even try to mount other female rats , proving that biology played a major role in animal behavior while she was bisexual , having had relationships with both men and women , she found women more sexually attractive and they featured more in her fantasies her job at the time of the study was a blue-collar occupation that was practiced almost exclusively by men however , vandermassen also argues that transgender people support the idea of gender identity as being biologically rooted , as they do not identify with their anatomical sex despite being raised and their behaviour reinforced according to their anatomical sex looked at fourteen genetic males who had suffered cloacal exstrophy and were thus raised as girls six of them changed their gender identity to male , five remained female and three had ambiguous gender identities ( though two of them had declared they were male ) argue that the evidence in totality suggests that gender identity is neither determined entirely by childhood rearing nor entirely by biological factors several prenatal , biological factors , including genes and hormones , may affect gender identity an intersex variation may complicate initial sex assignment and that assignment may not be consistent with the child 's future gender identity several studies have shown that sexually dimorphic brain structures in transsexuals are shifted away from what is associated with their birth sex and towards what is associated with their preferred sex found that a sample of androphilic trans women was shifted towards the female direction in brain responses direct effects of testosterone on the developing fetal brain are of major importance for the development of male gender identity and male heterosexual orientation '' a 2008 study found that the parents of gender-dysphoric children showed no signs of psychopathological issues aside from mild depression in the mothers wallien , psychosexual outcome of gender-dysphoric children ( 2008 ) it has been suggested that the attitudes of the child 's parents may affect the child 's gender identity , although evidence is minimal however , emily kane found that many parents still showed negative responses to items , activities , or attributes that were considered feminine , such as domestic skills , nurturance , and empathy '' many parents form gendered expectations for their child before it is even born , after determining the child 's sex through technology such as ultrasound the child thus is born to a gender-specific name , games , and even ambitions these different views on gender from a child 's parents can shape the child 's understanding of gender as well as the child 's development of gender no correlation was found between a father 's behavior and his children 's knowledge of stereotypes of their own gender gender variance and non-conformance the terms gender identity and core gender identity were first used with their current meaning—one 's personal experience of one 's own gender boles , 2013 '' the term 'gender identity ' was used in a press release , november 21 , 1966 , to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at the johns hopkins hospital it was disseminated in the media worldwide , and soon entered the vernacular 102 : '' gender identity was introduced into the professional lexicon by hooker and stoller almost simultaneously in the early 1960s ( see money , 1985 ) the 1987 revision of the manual , the dsm-iii-r , added a third diagnosis : gender identity disorder of adolescence and adulthood , nontranssexual type stock also argues that because the concept of gender identity rarely comes up outside the context of gender dysphoria , '' it would seem false to say that everyone has one '' bartlett , '' what can the samoan '' fa'afafine '' teach us about the western concept of gender identity disorder in childhood ? '' , biology and medicine , 50.4 ( 2007 ) 481–90 there are parts of the community that take '' two-spirit '' as a category over an identity itself , preferring to identify with culture or nation-specific gender terms
