the concept of reconfigurable computing has existed since the 1960s , when gerald estrin 's paper proposed the concept of a computer made of a standard processor and an array of '' reconfigurable '' hardware the main processor would control the behavior of the reconfigurable hardware the latter would then be tailored to perform a specific task , such as image processing or pattern matching , as quickly as a dedicated piece of hardware bobda : introduction to reconfigurable computing : architectures ; springer , 2007 such as : copacobana , matrix , garp , hauser , john r and wawrzynek , john , '' garp : a mips processor with a reconfigurable coprocessor '' , proceedings of the ieee symposium on field-programmable custom computing machines ( fccm '97 , april 16â€“18 , 1997 ) , pp some of these massively parallel reconfigurable computers were built primarily for special subdomains such as molecular evolution , neural or image processing computer scientist reiner hartenstein describes reconfigurable computing in terms of an anti-machine that , according to him , represents a fundamental paradigm shift away from the more conventional von neumann machine high-performance reconfigurable computing ( hprc ) is a computer architecture combining reconfigurable computing-based accelerators like field-programmable gate array with cpus or multi-core processors the attachment of such an fpga to a modern cpu over a high speed bus , like pci express , has enabled the configurable logic to act more like a coprocessor rather than a peripheral this has brought reconfigurable computing into the high-performance computing sphere furthermore , by replicating an algorithm on an fpga or the use of a multiplicity of fpgas has enabled reconfigurable simd systems to be produced where several computational devices can concurrently operate on different data , which is highly parallel computing this heterogeneous systems technique is used in computing research and especially in supercomputing the us national science foundation has a center for high-performance reconfigurable computing ( chrec ) commercial high-performance reconfigurable computing systems are beginning to emerge with the announcement of ibm integrating fpgas with its power processor partial re-configuration is the process of changing a portion of reconfigurable hardware circuitry while the other portion keeps its former configuration partial reconfiguration allows for critical parts of the design to continue operating while a controller either on the fpga or off of it loads a partial design into a reconfigurable module a common example for when partial reconfiguration would be useful is the case of a communication device while the partial data is sent into the fpga , the rest of the device is stopped ( in the shutdown mode ) and brought up after the configuration is completed such projects are built with reconfigurable hardware ( fpgas ) , and some devices support emulation of multiple vintage computers using a single reconfigurable hardware ( c-one ) module-based partial reconfiguration permits to reconfigure distinct modular parts of the design , while difference-based partial reconfiguration can be used when a small change is made to a design if too much interconnect is provided this requires more transistors than necessary and thus more silicon area , longer wires and more power consumption one of the key challenges for reconfigurable computing is to enable higher design productivity and provide an easier way to use reconfigurable computing systems for users that are unfamiliar with the underlying concepts
