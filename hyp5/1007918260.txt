the play begins with praxagora emerging from a house on an athenian street before daybreak the chorus of athenian women enter one by one , all dressed in similar costume one woman brings a basket full of yarn in order to get some work done as the assembly fills up , to which praxagora chastises her for this decision as it will ruin their cover the women are wary of the plan and praxagora attempts to rally them as they practice speaking as men before the assembly praxagora is frustrated by the women 's inability to pretend to be men , as they swear to demeter and persephone rather than apollo , address the assembled women as ladies , and complain about the discomfort of their disguises and their thirst '' she further explains that women are superior to men because they are harder workers , devoted to tradition and do not bother with useless innovations praxagora impresses the women with her rhetorical skills , and explains that it was learned from listening to orators while living with her husband on the pnyx , where the athenian assembly was held chremes , returning from the assembly , comes upon blepyrus and his neighbor and explains that he was not paid because of the unprecedented turn-out of pale faced shoe-makers ( referring to the women in disguise ) he relayed the events of the assembly and praxagora 's speech now free of attending the assembly , the men are pleased to finally sleep in , but are not excited about having to provide sex to receive their breakfast she feigns surprise when he explains to her the decision from the morning 's assembly , but immediately begins listing the reasons the decision was wise as the young girl and the old woman fight over the boy , two more old women enter and drag him away against his will the ascent of women in political power in assemblywomen is yet another commentary on what aristophanes saw as the shameful effeminacy of the men currently in power in athens the fact that women in this instance could enter the assembly and successfully pass as men was a commentary on politicians being indistinguishable from women in costume
