the later form , which appears in the hellenistic babylonian writer berossus ' first volume of universal history , is clearly related to greek , an eastern variant of it is thought that the proper name ti'amat , which is the construct or vocative form , was dropped in secondary translations of the original texts because some akkadian copyists of en청ma elish substituted the ordinary word t훮mtu ( '' sea '' ) for tiamat , the two names having become essentially the same due to association the babylonian epic enuma elish is named for its incipit : '' when above '' the heavens did not yet exist nor the earth below , apsu the subterranean ocean was there , '' the first , the begetter '' , and tiamat , the overground sea , '' she who bore them all '' ; they were '' mixing their waters '' tiamat is usually described as a sea serpent or dragon , although assyriologist alexander heidel disagreed with this identification and argued that '' dragon form can not be imputed to tiamat with certainty '' other scholars have disregarded heidel 's argument : joseph fontenrose in particular found it '' not convincing '' and concluded that '' there is reason to believe that tiamat was sometimes , not necessarily always , conceived as a dragoness '' the en청ma elish states that tiamat gave birth to dragons and serpents among a more general list of monsters including scorpion men and mermaid , but does not identify her form as that of a dragon ; however , other sources containing the same myth do refer to her as such the depiction of tiamat ( dungeons & dragons ) was popularized in the 1970s as a fixture of the dungeons & dragons roleplaying game inspired by earlier sources associating tiamat with later mythological characters such as lotan ( leviathan ) four ways of creation : '' tiamat & lotan abzu ( or aps청 ) fathered upon tiamat the elder deities lahmu and lahamu ( masc this angered kingu , their son , who reported the event to tiamat , whereupon she fashioned eleven monsters to battle the deities in order to avenge apsu 's death '' this surmise that the babylonian version of the story is based upon a modified version of an older epic , in which enlil , not marduk , was the god who slew tiamat , expressed , for example , in e the tiamat myth is one of the earliest recorded versions of the chaoskampf , the battle between a culture hero and a chthonic or aquatic monster , serpent or dragon the five headed dragon goddess in the dungeons & dragons game is named tiamat , and stars as one of the primary antagonists in the dungeons & dragons tv series in bruce coville 's jeremy thatcher , dragon hatcher ( from the magic shop series ) , a boy is given a dragon egg from elias 's magic shop and names the dragon tiamat , with whom he develops a mental connection
