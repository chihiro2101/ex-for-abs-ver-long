dartmouth lies on the east shore of halifax harbour , and halifax is on the west shore by 1917 , '' halifax 's inner harbour had become a principal assembly point for merchant convoys leaving for britain and france the completion of the intercolonial railway and its deep water terminal in 1880 allowed for increased steamship trade and led to accelerated development of the port area , but halifax faced an economic downturn in the 1890s as local factories lost ground to competitors in central canada the canadian government took over the halifax dockyard ( now cfb halifax ) from the royal navy this dockyard later became the command centre of the royal canadian navy upon its founding in 1910 as the royal canadian navy had virtually no seaworthy ships of its own , the royal navy assumed responsibility for maintaining atlantic trade routes by re-adopting halifax as its north american base of operations in 1915 , management of the harbour fell under the control of the royal canadian navy under the supervision of captain superintendent edward harrington martin ; by 1917 there was a growing naval fleet in halifax , including patrol ships , tugboats , and minesweepers the two main points of departure were in nova scotia at sydney , on cape breton island , and halifax hospital ships brought the wounded to the city , and a new military hospital was constructed in the city the success of german u-boat attacks on ships crossing the atlantic ocean led the allies to institute a convoy system to reduce losses while transporting goods and soldiers to europe merchant ships gathered at bedford basin on the northwestern end of the harbour , which was protected by two sets of anti-submarine nets and guarded by patrol ships of the royal canadian navy a large army garrison protected the city with forts , gun battery , and anti-submarine nets these factors drove a major military , industrial , and residential expansion of the city , and the weight of goods passing through the harbour increased nearly ninefold the norwegian ship had sailed from the netherlands en route to new york to take on relief supplies for belgium , under the command of haakon from the ship arrived in halifax on 3 december for neutral inspection and spent two days in bedford basin awaiting refuelling supplies though she had been given clearance to leave the port on 5 december , imos departure was delayed because her coal load did not arrive until late that afternoon the french cargo ship arrived from new york late on 5 december , under the command of aim√© le medec ships were expected to keep close to the lateral mark situated on their starboard ( '' right '' ) , and pass oncoming vessels '' port to port '' , that is to keep them on their '' left '' side the initial informal response was soon joined by surviving policemen , firefighters and military personnel who began to arrive , as did anyone with a working vehicle ; cars , trucks and delivery wagons of all kinds were enlisted to collect the wounded they also played a role after the blast , with fire companies arriving to assist from across halifax , and by the end of the day from as far away as amherst , nova scotia , and moncton , new brunswick , on relief trains halifax fire department 's west street station 2 was the first to arrive at pier 6 with the crew of the patricia , the first motorized fire engine in canada royal navy cruisers in port sent some of the first organized rescue parties ashore hms highflyer , along with the armed merchant cruisers hms changuinola , hms knight templar and hms calgarian , sent boats ashore with rescue parties and medical personnel and soon began to take wounded aboard out at sea , the american cruiser uss tacoma and armed merchant cruiser uss von steuben ( formerly ss kronprinz wilhelm ) were passing halifax en route to the united states spotting the large and rising column of smoke , tacoma altered course and arrived to assist rescue at 2 & nbsp ; pm troops at gun batteries and barracks immediately turned out in case the city was under attack , but within an hour switched from defence to rescue roles as the cause and location of the explosion were determined all available troops were called in from harbour fortifications and barracks to the north end to rescue survivors and provide transport to the city 's hospitals , including the two army hospitals in the city a cloud of steam shot out of ventilators at the ammunition magazine at wellington barracks as naval personnel extinguished a fire by the magazine the fire was quickly put out ; the cloud was seen from blocks away and quickly led to rumours that another explosion was imminent the committee organized members in charge of organizing medical relief for both halifax and dartmouth , supplying transportation , food and shelter , and covering medical and funeral costs for victims by nightfall , a dozen trains had reached halifax from the nova scotian towns of truro , kentville , amherst , stellarton , pictou , and sydney and from the new brunswick towns of sackville , moncton and saint john the halifax explosion remembrance book , an official database of the nova scotia archives and records management , identified 1,782 victims the last body , a caretaker killed at the exhibition grounds , was not recovered until the summer of 1919 coldwell was quickly formed at halifax city hall on the morning of the disaster the chebucto road school ( now the maritime conservatory of performing arts ) in west end , halifax was chosen as a central morgue africville received little of the donated relief funds and none of the progressive reconstruction invested in other parts of the city after the explosion efforts began shortly after the explosion to clear debris , repair buildings , and establish temporary housing for survivors left homeless by the explosion every building in the halifax dockyard required some degree of rebuilding , as did hmcs niobe and the docks themselves ; all of the royal canadian navy 's minesweepers and patrol boats were undamaged keith ross leckie scripted a miniseries entitled shattered city : the halifax explosion ( 2003 ) , which took the title but has no relationship to janet kitz 's non-fiction book shattered city : the halifax explosion and the road to recovery ( 1990 )
