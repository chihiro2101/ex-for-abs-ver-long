thompson excelled at his trade , and coming in contact with refined and well educated people for the first time , adopted many of their characteristics including an interest in science while recuperating in woburn in 1769 from an injury , thompson conducted experiments concerning the nature of heat and began to correspond with loammi baldwin and others about them her father was a minister , and her late husband left her property at concord , new hampshire , then called rumford when the american revolutionary war began thompson was a man of property and standing in new england and was opposed to the uprising thompson was welcomed by the british to whom he gave valuable information about the american forces , and became an advisor to both thomas gage and lord george germain image : englischer garten fg02.jpg thumb the beer garden '' am chinesischen turm '' in the englischer garten in munich in 1785 , he moved to bavaria where he became an aide-de-camp to the prince-elector charles theodore he also invented rumford 's soup , a soup for the poor , and established the cultivation of the potato in bavaria he studied methods of cooking , heating , and lighting , including the relative costs and efficiencies of wax candles , tallow candles , and oil lamps on prince charles ' behalf he created the englischer garten in munich in 1789 ; it remains today and is known as one of the largest urban public parks in the world for his efforts , in 1791 thompson was made a count of the holy roman empire ; he took the name '' rumford '' for rumford , new hampshire , which was an older name for the town of concord where he had been married , becoming reichsgraf von rumford ( english : imperial count rumford ) he devised a method for measuring the specific heat of a solid substance but was disappointed when johan wilcke published his parallel discovery first rumford ( 1797 ) '' on the propagation of heat in fluids '' nicholson 's journal 1 pp298-341 the idea raised considerable objections from the scientific establishment , john dalton cardwell ( 1971 ) p.99 and john leslie making particularly forthright attacks instrumentation far exceeding anything available in terms of accuracy and precision would have been needed to verify thompson 's claim rumford 's most important scientific work took place in munich , and centred on the nature of heat , which he contended in '' an experimental enquiry concerning the source of the heat which is excited by friction '' ( 1798 ) was not the caloric of then-current scientific thinking but a form of motion rumford made no attempt to further quantify the heat generated or to measure the mechanical equivalent of heat he did experiments to support his theories of calorific and frigorific radiation and said the communication of heat was the net effect of calorific ( hot ) rays and frigorific ( cold ) rays and the rays emitted by the object see note 8 , '' an enquiry concerning the nature of heat and the mode of its communication '' philosophical transactions of the royal society , starting at page 112 image : royal institution - humphry davy.jpg thumb right satirical cartoon by james gillray showing a royal institution lecture on pneumatics with davy holding the bellows and count rumford looking on at extreme right rumford street ( and the nearby rumford place ) in liverpool , england , are so named due to a soup kitchen established to count rumford 's plan which formerly stood on land adjacent to rumford street collected works of count rumford , volume i , the nature of heat , ( 1968 )
