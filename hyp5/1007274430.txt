the intention was to build a line from liverpool to grimsby , and to convert part of the canal into a railway locally , this included a line from staveley to gainsborough , via worksop , with a branch to lincoln and another from worksop to beighton the previous year , the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway had been proposed , to build a line from sheffield to gainsborough , and was supported by the sheffield , ashton-under-lyne & manchester railway now arguing from a position of strength , the manchester & lincoln union rescinded their plans for most of their lines , and obtained an act of parliament on 7 august 1846 allowing them to construct a line from the midland railway at staveley to the canal at worksop the new company amalgamated with the chesterfield canal , to become the rather unwieldy manchester & lincoln union railway & chesterfield & gainsborough canal , with powers to further amalgamate with the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway however , by the time they announced this , the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway had already become part of the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway , and so they amalgamated with that company instead the act of parliament stated that although the canal company was to be dissolved , the entire canal was to be retained , its water supplies maintained , and tolls were to be fixed at a just level under the new regime , the canal was put back into good order in 1848 , after many years where regular maintenance had been neglected the railway company started to operate as a carrier on the canal , and to maintain water levels , the reservoirs at chesterfield were enlarged in 1856 the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway was expanding , and an act of parliament was obtained in 1889 , which allowed them to divert parts of the canal to enable a new railway connecting chesterfield , staveley and beighton to be constructed the new route was straighter than the old , and reduced the length of the canal by around close to bluebank lock , the railway , known as the great central railway chesterfield loop , turned to the east and passed to the south of staveley iron works to reach staveley town station prior to construction of this section , the canal looped to the north around the iron works , passing through cinderhill lock before turning south-eastwards parts of the canal above worksop were affected by subsidence from local coal mines some 40 boats were still working on the canal , although a short section between staveley and chesterfield had become unnavigable various attempts to reduce the growth of weed , which had first appeared on the canal in 1852 , were made , with variable success , and there was a brisk trade in munitions during the second world war the british transport commission agreed to keep the canal open for two more years in 1962 , although the lockgates from worksop to kiveton were removed , and the lock walls bulldozed , on the grounds of public safety unofficial work parties were organised , to clear locks and cut back vegetation and weed ; they were unofficial because the british transport commission would not allow volunteers to work on their property by 1968 , restoration efforts were sufficiently organised that the chesterfield canal was mentioned in the may edition of the bulletin , produced for members of the inland waterways association ( iwa ) by the forerunners of the waterway recovery group the duke of devonshire opened the festivities , and the chesterfield canal society was formally launched , with a view to attracting support from anyone interested in the canal , rather than just from boaters progress beyond worksop moved forwards rapidly in 1995 , when a derelict land grant was obtained by nottinghamshire county council , and with additional funding from british coal , a £4.5 million scheme began to restore the canal between worksop and the aqueduct over the river ryton which forms the county boundary rotherham borough council were hoping to obtain similar grants for the section between the aqueduct and the norwood tunnel , but the funding came from the heritage lottery fund and the regeneration agency english partnerships however , in practice progress had been slow , and attention turned to the section west of norwood tunnel , where much more damage had been done to the canal bed , with it being filled in and built over in many places the last few miles of the canal , from chesterfield to staveley , were in reasonable condition , although the towpath was overgrown and difficult to access , while much of the route was under threat from opencast coal mining and a planned bypass , which had first been proposed in 1927 regular workparties began the process of restoration in 1988 , organised by the chesterfield canal society , and supplemented by volunteers from the waterway recovery group periodically derbyshire county council acquired the section of canal between chesterfield and staveley and secured derelict land grants to enable dredging and towpath maintenance to take place thumb the southern end of the canal in chesterfield is being redeveloped as part of a £300 & nbsp ; million project called chesterfield waterside the chesterfield canal trust campaigned to have the needs of the canal taken into account during the consultation process norwood tunnel was a , and , brick-lined canal tunnel on the line of the chesterfield canal with its western portal in norwood , derbyshire and its eastern portal in kiveton , south yorkshire this would provide a way to reach the chesterfield canal without negotiating the tidal river trent , and would create a new cruising ring , taking in the rother link , river don navigation , stainforth and keadby canal , river trent , and chesterfield canal
