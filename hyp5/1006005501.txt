the severity of the specific defect may also be great or small as a rule , mitochondrial diseases are worse when the defective mitochondria are present in the muscles , cerebrum , or nerves , because these cells use more energy than most other cells in the body although mitochondrial diseases vary greatly in presentation from person to person , several major clinical categories of these conditions have been defined , based on the most common phenotypic features , symptoms , and signs associated with the particular mutations that tend to cause them mitochondrial disorders may be caused by mutations ( acquired or inherited ) , in mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) , or in nuclear genes that code for mitochondrial components oxalate may enter cells where it is known to cause mitochondrial dysfunction nuclear dna has two copies per cell ( except for sperm and egg cells ) , one copy being inherited from the father and the other from the mother those mitochondria make more copies , normally reaching 500 mitochondria per cell if only a few of the mtdna copies inherited from the mother are defective , mitochondrial division may cause most of the defective copies to end up in just one of the new mitochondria ( for more detailed inheritance patterns , see human mitochondrial genetics ) mitochondrial disease may become clinically apparent once the number of affected mitochondria reaches a certain level ; this phenomenon is called '' threshold expression '' mitochondria possess many of the same dna repair pathways as nuclei doâ€”but not all of them ; therefore , mutations occur more frequently in mitochondrial dna than in nuclear dna ( see mutation rate ) human mitochondrial dna encodes 13 proteins of the respiratory chain , while most of the estimated 1,500 proteins and components targeted to mitochondria are nuclear-encoded mitochondrial replacement therapy ( mrt ) , where the nuclear dna is transferred to another healthy egg cell leaving the defective mitochondrial dna behind , is an ivf treatment procedure charlie gard , a british boy who suffered from mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome ; decisions about his care were taken to various law courts
