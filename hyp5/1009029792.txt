the history of level crossings depends on the location , but often early level crossings had a flagman in a nearby booth who would , on the approach of a train , wave a red flag or lantern to stop all traffic and clear the tracks gated crossings became commonplace in many areas , as they protected the railway from people trespassing and livestock , and they protected the users of the crossing when closed by the signalman/gateman full , half or no barrier crossings superseded gated crossings , although crossings of older types can still be found in places in rural regions with sparse traffic , the least expensive type of level crossing to operate is one without flagmen or gates , with only a warning sign posted article 33 , 34 , 35 and 36 are specific to level crossings , because level crossings are recognized as dangerous with rare exceptions , trains do not stop at level crossings and rely on vehicles and pedestrians to clear the tracks in advance today , active protection is widely available , and fewer collisions take place at level crossings with active warning systems the crossing lights may begin flashing and the gates lower immediately , or this might be delayed until after the traffic light turns red in other areas , the traffic parallel to the railroad track will have a flashing yellow for the duration of the train while the other directions face a flashing red light for the duration of the train railway safety in the european union , safety overview 2017 , sbn 978-92-9205-383-3 issn 2529-6302 doi:10.2821/813806 doi:10.2821/474487 tr-ag-17-101-en-c tr-ag-17-101-en-n 53 % of all those level crossings are active level where users are protected from or warned of the approaching train by devices activated when it is unsafe for the user to traverse the crossing railway safety in the european union , safety overview 2017 , sbn 978-92-9205-383-3 issn 2529-6302 doi:10.2821/813806 doi:10.2821/474487 tr-ag-17-101-en-c tr-ag-17-101-en-n the remaining 47 % of level crossings are unprotected when the full length of the runway is open , a vertical bar of green lights signal to the aircraft , with regular rail signals on either side of the runway indicating trains to stop
