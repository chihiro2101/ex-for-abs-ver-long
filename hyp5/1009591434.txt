a significant number of moorcock 's novels and short stories take place in one shared multiverse : a wide array of interconnected parallel universes , many-layered dimensions , spheres , and alternative worlds , which spans from the big bang to the end of time and from earth to faraway galaxies all the different eternal champions are implied to be different facets or '' incarnations '' of one semi-conscious being ( a platonic archetype of a sort ) : most of them are peerless fighters and generals and have an unbreakable bond with a sentient chaos-aligned weapon , the black sword , which in turns takes on a different form for each champion this recursivity through the multiverse is further underlined by the number of champions , companions , and mentor-figures to the champions moorcock has given the j and c initials , as a form of naming fil rouge ; in the same vein , many champions and companions belong to one branch or another of the extensive von bek dynasty '' the blood red game '' was eventually combined with the earlier novella '' the sundered worlds '' ( 1962 ) into the full-length novel the sundered worlds ( 1965 ) , making asquiol somehow of a guest character into the von bek saga aubec , earl of malador : aubec debuted in a 1964 short story titled either '' the dream of earl aubec '' or '' master of chaos '' depending on the collection : he lives in the same world as elric of melniboné many generations before that character 's birth , serves as a national champion of the human kingdom of lormyria and is the paramour of the lormyrian monarch , queen eloarde moorcock planned a whole series about aubec 's wars against melniboné in order to ensure human independence , eventually reconnecting to elric 's saga as a direct prequel , but the project was eventually aborted ; consequently , '' the dream of earl aubec '' was reincorporated into elric 's series as a prologue jerry cornelius : an adventurer and dimensional traveler moorcock created in the mid-sixties and developed for the following forty years , resulting in an early tetralogy of novels , the cornelius quartet ( 1968-1977 ) , a ponderous collection of short fiction , the lives and times of jerry cornelius ( 1976 ) , and a later hexalogy of novels , the cornelius calendar ( composed in two stages , 1976-1981 and 2002-2008 ) , with more tales in the working moreover , it is implied that lord jagged of canaria from jherek carnelian 's series , jaspar colinadous from one of elric 's adventures , dorian hawkmoon 's jehamia cohnahlias , corum 's jhary-a-conel , and john daker 's jermays the crooked are jerry 's counterparts in their respective dimensions jerry cornell : in 1966 moorcock edited ( and in fact ghost-wrote ) a sizeable section of the spy novel the lsd dossier by roger harris and eventually authored two novels starring harris 's original main character , secret agent nick allard ; later on moorcock revised his solo works into a stand-alone series centered upon agent jerry cornell ( 1970-1980 ) , an overt parody of character tropes and clichés from ian fleming 's james bond series at the beginning of the novella '' the eternal champion '' ( 1962 ; expanded into a novel of the same title in 1970 ) erekosë has been dead for generations , but a necromantic ritual resurrects him as a new existence for john daker ; the reborn erekosë consequently gets entangled into a world war between humans and eldrens and into a love triangle between the two factions ' princesses , eldren ermizhad and human iolinda in the dragon in the sword ( 1986 ) daker as flamadin and his companion from 20th century germany , ulrich von bek , travel across many interconnected dimensions to prevent a major cataclysm elric 's series represents a major milestone in sword & sorcery fiction and , unlike moorcock 's later works , was composed anachronically : it originally consisted of seven short stories and a stormbringer ( novel ) written from 1961 to 1967 , but it was later expanded with an origin story , a prequel and a midquel in the early seventies , a third prequel and a second midquel in the early nineties , and some more peripheral contents during the early 21st century the 1996 revision of the wrecks of time renamed faustaff 's ally gordon ogg into '' gordon begg '' , in order to retcon him into a von bek and underline those character 's respective status as an eternal champion and companion , but this change was eventually dropped in the 2014 reprint dorian 's war against granbretan is central in the runestaff tetralogy ( 1967-1969 ) while his family life with yisselda serves as a backdrop to the chronicles of castle brass/count brass trilogy ( 1973-1975 ) , which culminates into a crossover with elric 's , daker 's , and corum 's respective series graf ulrich 's actions reverberate through space and time by making the von beks aware of the multiverse , the designated owners of the sword ravenbrand ( which is , in fact , mournblade from elric 's series ) and uniquely attuned to magic and dimensional travel , so that different members of the bloodline are involved in many other sagas and stand-alone episodes of the eternal champion mythos other noteworthy von beks across the cycle are : manfred von bek : the main character of the city in the autumn stars ( 1986 ) , a direct sequel to the war hound and the world 's pain , manfred carries on graf ulrich 's quest for the grail as europe is engulfed by the french revolution ; he is aided by the duchess of crete , libussa cartagena y mendoza-chilperic count ulrich rudric renark otto von bek-krasny , also known as '' zenith the albino '' : an eternal champion existing on 20th century earth and most likely a reincarnated elric of melniboné , since his black sword is stormbringer itself ;

starting from 1994 and up to 2000 , a parallel project simply called '' the eternal champion '' was undertaken by white wolf publishing for the north american market , but each of the two series ended up including some contents left out of its counterpart due to licensing issues , while certain works could not make into the collection whatsoever
