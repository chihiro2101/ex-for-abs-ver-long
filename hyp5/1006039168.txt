zirconium is one of the main components of zircon crystals , currently the oldest known minerals in the earth 's crust many later transition metals , such as rhodium , are very commonly used in jewelry due to the fact that they are incredibly shiny this period is known to have a large number of exceptions to the madelung rule it is an alkali metal , the most reactive group in the periodic table , having properties and similarities with both other alkali metals and other period 5 elements for example , rubidium has 5 electron shells , a property found in all other period 5 elements , whereas its electron configuration 's ending is similar to all other alkali metals : s 1 rubidium also follows the trend of increasing reactivity as the atomic number increases in the alkali metals , for it is more reactive than potassium , but less so than caesium in addition , both potassium and rubidium yield almost the same hue when ignited , so researchers must use different methods to differentiate between these two 1st group elements rubidium is very susceptible to redox in air , similar to most of the other alkali metals , so it readily transforms into rubidium oxide , a yellow solid with the chemical formula rb 2 o strontium is the second element placed in the 5th period it is an alkaline earth metal , a relatively reactive group , although not nearly as reactive as the alkali metals in addition , strontium , like rubidium , redox in air and turns a yellow color yttrium is a chemical element with symbol y and atomic number 39 it is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the lanthanides and it has often been classified as a '' rare earth element '' yttrium is almost always found combined with the lanthanides in rare earth minerals and is never found in nature as a free element johan gadolin discovered yttrium 's oxide in arrhenius ' sample in 1789 , yttrium krogt and anders gustaf ekeberg named the new oxide yttria zirconium is a chemical element with the symbol zr and atomic number 40 zirconium is mainly used as a refractory and opacifier , although minor amounts are used as alloying agent for its strong resistance to corrosion it is a soft , grey , ductile transition metal , which is often found in the pyrochlore mineral , the main commercial source for niobium , and columbite the german chemist heinrich rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element , which he named niobium although alloys contain only a maximum of 0.1 % , that small percentage of niobium improves the strength of the steel other applications of niobium include its use in welding , nuclear industries , electronics , optics , numismatics and jewelry in the last two applications , niobium 's low toxicity and ability to be colored by anodizing are particular advantages the name is from neo-latin molybdaenum , from ancient greek , meaning lead , itself proposed as a loanword from anatolian luvian and lydian languages , since its ores were confused with lead ores the free element , which is a silvery metal , has the sixth-highest melting point of any element it readily forms hard , stable carbides , and for this reason it is often used in high-strength steel alloys molybdenum does not occur as a free metal on earth , but rather in various oxidation states in minerals molybdenum minerals have long been known , but the element was '' discovered '' ( in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals ) in 1778 by carl wilhelm scheele it is the lowest atomic number element without any stable isotopes ; every form of it is radioactive many of technetium 's properties were predicted by dmitri mendeleev before the element was discovered long-lived technetium isotopes produced commercially are by-products of fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods ruthenium is a chemical element with symbol ru and atomic number 44 it is a rare transition metal belonging to the platinum group of the periodic table the russian scientist karl ernst claus discovered the element in 1844 and named it after ruthenia , the latin word for rus ' rhodium is a chemical element that is a rare , silvery-white , hard , and chemically inert transition metal and a member of the platinum group it has the chemical symbol rh and atomic number 45 naturally occurring rhodium is found as the free metal , alloyed with similar metals , and never as a chemical compound it is one of the rarest precious metals and one of the most costly ( gold has since taken over the top spot of cost per ounce ) the element 's major use ( about 80 % of world rhodium production ) is as one of the catalysts in the catalytic converter three-way of automobiles tin is a chemical element with the symbol sn ( for and atomic number 50 tellurium is a chemical element that has the symbol te and atomic number 52 xenon is a chemical element with the symbol xe and atomic number 54
