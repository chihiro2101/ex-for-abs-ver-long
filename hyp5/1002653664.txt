laboratories used for scientific research take many forms because of the differing requirements of specialists in the various fields of science and engineering a physics laboratory might contain a particle accelerator or vacuum chamber , while a metallurgy laboratory could have apparatus for casting or refining metals or for testing their strength a chemist or biology might use a wet laboratory , while a psychology laboratory might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior in some laboratories , such as those commonly used by computer scientists , computers ( sometimes supercomputers ) are used for either simulations or the analysis of data engineers use laboratories as well to design , build , and test technological devices scientific laboratories can be found as research room and learning spaces in schools and university , industry , government , or military facilities , and even aboard ships and spacecraft for the purposes of research , teaching , or analysis ; ( also ) one in which chemicals or drugs are manufactured '' the emergence of big science during world war ii increased the size of laboratories and scientific equipment , introducing particle accelerators and similar devices the earliest laboratory according to the present evidence is a home laboratory of pythagoras of samos , the well-known greek philosopher and scientist the laboratory is called speculum alchemiae and is preserved as a museum in prague laboratory techniques are the set of procedures used on natural sciences such as chemistry , biology , physics to conduct an experiment , all of them follow the scientific method ; while some of them involve the use of complex laboratory equipment from laboratory glassware to electrical devices , and others require more specific or expensive supplies the title of laboratory is also used for certain other facilities where the processes or equipment used are similar to those in scientific laboratories work is divided , not only between different jobs of the laboratory such as the researchers , engineers and technicians , but also in terms of autonomy ( should the work be individual or in groups ) for example , one research group has a schedule where they conduct research on their own topic of interest for one day of the week , but for the rest they work on a given group project from the 1950s , the laboratory has evolved from being an educational tool used by teachers to attract the top students into research , into an organizational model allowing a high level of scientific productivity there are three main factors that contribute to the organizational form of a laboratory : the educational background of the researchers and their socialization process the main subject of the study revolved around the relationship between the staff of a laboratory ( researchers , administrators , receptionists , technicians , etc a locator is an employee of a laboratory who is in charge of knowing where each member of the laboratory currently is , based on a unique signal emitted from the badge of each staff member this hierarchy helps understand information distribution , control , and attitudes towards technologies in the laboratory
