one monkey named helen could be considered the '' star monkey in visual research '' because she was the original blindsight subject helen was a macaque monkey that had been decorticated ; specifically , her primary visual cortex ( v1 ) was completely removed , blinding her furthermore , under certain experimental conditions , she could detect a variety of visual stimuli , such as the presence and location of objects , as well as shape , pattern , orientation , motion , and color subjects who had suffered damage to their visual cortices due to accidents or strokes reported partial or total blindness in spite of this , when they were prompted they could '' guess '' with above-average accuracy about the presence and details of objects , much like the animal subjects , and they could even catch objects that were tossed at them patients with blindsight have damage to the system that produces visual perception ( the visual cortex of the brain and some of the nerve fibers that bring information to it from the eyes ) rather than to the underlying brain system controlling eye movements the phenomenon shows how , after the more complex perception system is damaged , people can use the underlying control system to guide hand movements towards an object even though they can not see what they are reaching for blindsight patients show awareness of single visual features , such as edges and motion , but can not gain a holistic visual percept this suggests that perceptual awareness is modular and that—in sighted individuals—there is a '' binding process that unifies all information into a whole percept '' , which is interrupted in patients with such conditions as blindsight and visual agnosia therefore , object identification and object recognition are thought to be separate processes and occur in different areas of the brain , working independently from one another research has shown that visual stimuli with the single visual features of sharp borders , sharp onset/offset times , motion , and low spatial frequency contribute to , but are not strictly necessary for , an object 's salience in blindsight another explanation for the phenomenon of blindsight is that even though the majority of a person 's visual cortex may be damaged , tiny islands of functioning tissue remain the stereoscopic information is attached to the object information passed to the visual cortex the monkeys were placed in front of a monitor and taught to indicate whether a stationary object or nothing was present in their visual field when a tone was played the monkeys performed very similar to human participants and were unable to perceive the presence of stationary objects outside of their visual field another 1995 study by the same group sought to prove that monkeys could also be conscious of movement in their deficit visual field despite not being consciously aware of the presence of an object there to do this , researchers used another standard test for humans which was similar to the previous study except moving objects were presented in the deficit visual field several years later , another study compared and contrasted the data collected from monkeys and that of a specific human patient with blindsight , gy lawrence weiskrantz and colleagues showed in the early 1970s that if forced to guess about whether a stimulus is present in their blind field , some observers do better than chance similarly , another patient with unilateral lesion of area v1 could avoid obstacles placed in his blind field when he reached toward a target that was visible in his intact visual field a study reported in 2008 asked patient gy to misstate where in his visual field a distinctive stimulus was presented he was able to misstate , as requested , in his left visual field ( with normal conscious vision ) ; but he tended to fail in the task—to state the location correctly—when the stimulus was in his blindsight ( right ) visual field the discovery of the condition known as blindsight raised questions about how different types of visual information , even unconscious information , may be affected and sometimes even unaffected by damage to different areas of the visual cortex previous studies had already demonstrated that even without conscious awareness of visual stimuli humans could still determine certain visual features such as presence in the visual field , shape , orientation and movement but , in a newer study evidence showed that if the damage to the visual cortex occurs in areas above the primary visual cortex the conscious awareness of visual stimuli itself is not damaged so even when damage occurs in the area necessary for conscious awareness of visual information , other functions of the processing of these visual percepts are still available to the individual both of the subjects had displayed the ability to accurately determine the presence of visual stimuli in their blind hemifields without acknowledging an actual visual percept previously to test the effect of brightness on the subject 's ability to determine motion they used a white background with a series of colored dots their procedure was to have the participants face the display for a period of time and ask them to tell the researchers when the dots were moving when the contrast in brightness between the background and the dots was higher , both of the subjects could discern motion more accurately than they would have statistically by just guessing the participant was able to accurately determine the orientation of the line when the target was cued by an arrow before the appearance of the target , even though these visual stimuli did not equal awareness in the subject who had no vision in that area of his/her visual field destruction of the primary visual cortex leads to blindness in the part of the visual field that corresponds to the damaged cortical representation injury to the primary visual cortex , including lesions and other trauma , leads to the loss of visual experience
