the main organs involved in urination are the urinary bladder and the urethra the smooth muscle of the bladder , known as the detrusor , is innervated by sympathetic nervous system fibers from the lumbar spinal cord and parasympathetic fibers from the sacrum spinal cord smooth muscle bundles pass on either side of the urethra , and these fibers are sometimes called the internal urethral sphincter , although they do not encircle the urethra further along the urethra is a sphincter of skeletal muscle , the sphincter of the membranous urethra ( external urethral sphincter ) in healthy individuals , the lower urinary tract has two discrete phases of activity : the storage ( or guarding ) phase , when urine is stored in the bladder ; and the voiding phase , when urine is released through the urethra the state of the reflex system is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra at low bladder volumes , afferent firing is low , resulting in excitation of the outlet ( the sphincter and urethra ) , and relaxation of the bladder voiding continues until the bladder empties completely , at which point the bladder relaxes and the outlet contracts to re-initiate storage during micturition , parasympathetic stimulation causes the detrusor muscle to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to relax in infants , voiding occurs involuntarily ( as a reflex ) in the adult , the volume of urine in the bladder that normally initiates a reflex contraction is about during storage , bladder pressure stays low , because of the bladder 's highly compliant nature a plot of bladder ( intravesical ) pressure against the depressant of fluid in the bladder ( called a cystometrogram ) , will show a very slight rise as the bladder is filled this phenomenon is a manifestation of the law of laplace , which states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius the bladder 's smooth muscle has some inherent contractile activity ; however , when its nerve supply is intact , stretch receptors in the bladder wall initiate a reflex contraction that has a lower threshold than the inherent contractile response of the muscle action potentials carried by sensory neurons from stretch receptors in the urinary bladder wall travel to the sacral segments of the spinal cord through the pelvic nerves since bladder wall stretch is low during the storage phase , these afferent neurons fire at low frequencies conversely , afferent input causes contraction of the sphincter through excitation of onuf 's nucleus , and contraction of the bladder neck and urethra through excitation of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons diuresis ( production of urine by the kidney ) occurs constantly , and as the bladder becomes full , afferent firing increases , yet the micturition reflex can be voluntarily inhibited until it is appropriate to begin voiding voiding begins when a voluntary signal is sent from the brain to begin urination , and continues until the bladder is empty bladder afferent signals ascend the spinal cord to the periaqueductal gray , where they project both to the pontine micturition center and to the cerebrum once the voluntary signal to begin voiding has been issued , neurons in pontine micturition center fire maximally , causing excitation of sacral preganglionic neurons the firing of these neurons causes the wall of the bladder to contract ; as a result , a sudden , sharp rise in intravesical pressure occurs the pontine micturition center also causes inhibition of onuf 's nucleus , resulting in relaxation of the external urinary sphincter when the external urinary sphincter is relaxed urine is released from the urinary bladder when the pressure there is great enough to force urine to flow out of the urethra the micturition reflex normally produces a series of contractions of the urinary bladder the flow of urine through the urethra has an overall excitatory role in micturition , which helps sustain voiding until the bladder is empty urine remaining in the male urethra is expelled by several contractions of the bulbospongiosus muscle , and , by some men , manual squeezing along the length of the penis to expel the rest of the urine another possibility is the excitation or disinhibition of neurons in the pontine micturition center , which causes concurrent contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the sphincter in humans with lesions in the superior frontal gyrus , the desire to urinate is reduced and there is also difficulty in stopping micturition once it has commenced the bladder can be made to contract by voluntary facilitation of the spinal voiding reflex when it contains only a few milliliters of urine voluntary contraction of the abdominal muscles aids the expulsion of urine by increasing the pressure applied to the urinary bladder wall , but voiding can be initiated without straining even when the bladder is nearly empty the external sphincter can be contracted voluntarily , which will prevent urine from passing down the urethra in many males the feeling of the need to urinate can be sensed at the base of the penis as well as the bladder , even though the neural activity associated with a full bladder comes from the bladder itself , and can be felt there as well when the bladder becomes too full , the sphincter muscles will involuntarily relax , allowing urine to pass from the bladder bladder sphincter dyssynergia , a discoordination between the bladder and external urethral sphincter as a result of brain or spinal cord injury a drug that increases urination is called a diuretic , whereas antidiuretics decrease the production of urine by the kidneys paruresis , also known as shy bladder syndrome , is an example of a bladder interruption from the brain that often causes total interruption until the person has left a public area when the sacral dorsal roots are cut in experimental animals or interrupted by diseases of the dorsal roots such as tabes dorsalis in humans , all reflex contractions of the bladder are abolished after spinal shock has passed , a spinally mediated voiding reflex ensues , although there is no voluntary control and no inhibition or facilitation from higher centers this type of bladder is sometimes called the spastic neurogenic bladder the reflex hyperactivity is made worse , and may be caused , by infection in the bladder wall due to the positions where the urethra exits the body , males and females often use different techniques for urination most males prefer to urinate standing while others prefer to urinate sitting or squatting an alternative method for women to urinate standing is to use a tool known as a female urination device to assist most often in such cases , doctors will reposition the urethra to a location where urination can still be accomplished , usually in a position that would promote urination only while seated/squatting , though a permanent urinary catheter may be used in rare cases babies have little socialized control over urination within traditions or families that do not practice elimination communication and instead use diapers public toilets may have urinals , usually for males , although female urinals exist , designed to be used in various ways however , in public restrooms without urinals and sometimes at home , men may be urged to use the sitting position as to diminish spattering of urine females usually sit or squat for urination , depending on what type of toilet they use : a squat toilet is used for urination in a squatting position in many societies and in many social classes , even mentioning the need to urinate is seen as a social transgression , despite it being a universal need the urine marking behavior is also most frequent during the mating season , and may play a role in reproductive communication between groups other types of urine-marking in wolves are flu ( flexed-leg urination ) , stu ( standing urination ) , and squ ( squatting urination )
