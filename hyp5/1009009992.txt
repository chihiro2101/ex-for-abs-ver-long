what is a pattern ? when a designer designs something – whether a house , computer program , or lamp – they must make many decisions about how to solve problems a single problem is documented with its typical place ( the syntax ) , and use ( the grammar ) with the most common and recognized good solution seen in the wild , like the examples seen in dictionary each pattern has a name , a descriptive entry , and some cross-references , much like a dictionary entry a documented pattern should explain why that solution is good in the pattern 's contexts guiding patterns of naturally occurring design : elements regarding the theoretical background of patterns and the practical implementation of pattern methods in research and teaching like all languages , a pattern language has vocabulary , syntax , and grammar – but a pattern language applies to some complex activity other than communication in pattern languages for design , the parts break down in this way : the language description – the vocabulary – is a collection of named , described solutions to problems in a field of interest each solution includes syntax , a description that shows where the solution fits in a larger , more comprehensive or more abstract design perhaps that part of the design can be left empty to save money or other resources ; if people do not need to wait to enter a room , a simple doorway can replace a waiting room in the language description , grammar and syntax cross index ( often with a literal alphabetic index of pattern names ) to other named solutions , so the designer can quickly think from one solution to related , needed solutions , and document them in a logical way in christopher alexander 's book a pattern language , the patterns are in decreasing order by size , with a separate alphabetic index the web of relationships in the index of the language provides many paths through the design process just as words must have grammar and semantic relationships to each other in order to make a spoken language useful , design patterns must be related to each other in position and utility order to form a pattern language eventually all of the remaining design problems are small enough or routine enough to be solved by improvisation by the builders , and the '' design '' is done this gives the designer using the language a great deal of guidance about the related problems that must be solved the most difficult part of having an outside expert apply a pattern language is in fact to get a reliable , complete list of the problems to be solved the range of situations in which the problems and solutions addressed in a pattern apply is called its context examples can further illustrate how the pattern applies to very different situation for instance , alexander 's pattern '' a place to wait '' addresses bus stops in the same way as waiting rooms in a surgery , while still proposing helpful and constructive solutions however , even a very abstract pattern will usually contain examples that are , by nature , absolutely concrete and specific alexander gives each pattern a rating by zero , one or two stars , indicating how well they are proven in real-world examples the patterns in alexander 's book also vary in their level of scale – some describing how to build a town or neighbourhood , others dealing with individual buildings and the interior of rooms a pattern must characterize the problems that it is meant to solve , the context or situation where these problems arise , and the conditions under which the proposed solutions can be recommended a pattern language , as conceived by alexander , contains links from one pattern to another , so when trying to apply one pattern in a project , a designer is pushed to other patterns that are considered helpful in its context in order to enable this , his books do not focus strictly on architecture or civil engineering ; he also explains the general method of pattern languages each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment , and then describes the core solution to that problem , in such a way that you can use the solution a million times over , without ever doing it the same way twice '' a pattern language is a network of patterns that call upon one another since at least the mid-2000s , the idea of pattern language was introduced into systems architecture design the idea of a pattern language has also been applied in permaculture design
