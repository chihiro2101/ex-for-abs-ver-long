up until world war ii , australia had been one of the world 's leading centres of aviation governments on both sides of politics , well aware of the immense stretches of uninhabitable desert that separated the small productive regions of australia , regarded air transport as a matter of national importance ( as did the governments of other geographically large nations , such as the soviet union and the united states ) in the words of director general of civil aviation ab corbett , a nation which refuses to use flying in its national life must necessarily today be a backward and defenceless nation by the end of the war , there were only nine domestic airlines remaining , eight smaller regional concerns and australian national airways ( ana ) , a conglomerate owned by british and australian shipping interests which had a virtual monopoly on the major trunk routes and received 85 % of all government air transport subsidies the chifley government 's view was summed up by minister for air , arthur drakeford : where are the great pioneers of aviation ? air transport , the government believed , was primarily a public service , like hospitals , the railways or the post office in august 1945 , only two days after the end of world war ii , the australian parliament passed the australian national airways bill , which set up the australian national airways commission ( anac ) and charged it with the task of reconstructing the nation 's air transport industry in keeping with the labor government 's socialist leanings , the bill declared that the licenses of private operators would lapse for those routes that were adequately serviced by the national carrier much of the press objected strongly to the setting up of a public airline network , seeing it as a form of socialisation by stealth with the bill suitably amended to remove the monopoly provisions , the australian national airways commission came into existence in february 1946 the commissioners themselves were prominent high-achievers , including the director-general of civil aviation , the deputy director , a labor party luminary and former member of the commonwealth bank board , the director-general of posts and telegraphs , and the assistant secretary of the treasury he was ' a great believer in competition for business ' contested skies : trans-australian airlines , australian airlines , 1946–1992 , by john gunn , p 17 and would not have accepted the post of chairman of the anac had the monopoly provision been retained the commission decided on the name '' trans-australia airlines '' , applied to the treasury for a preliminary advance of £10,000 and set about making plans , recruiting staff , and purchasing equipment eventually , the anac proceeded with the original plan , to build an airline from scratch brain had 22 years of pioneering aviation experience behind him and was regarded as the man behind qantas ' reputation for technical excellence he applied for the advertised position of taa operations manager , but to his surprise and delight , was instead offered an appointment as general manager & nbsp ; — though at £3,000 pa , not the £10,000 that had been offered to holyman taa acquired its first two aircraft in mid-june 1946 , both douglas dc-3s a dozen more dc-3s would be added over the next few months , all ex-royal australian air force aircraft originally bought by the australian government under lend-lease he later wrote : : to my utter astonishment arthur coles , after the expected pep-talk about the dc-4 assignment , said he was relying on me to find out what new equipment was being developed that would enable us to offer our passengers a better product than our established rival , at a competitive price if we do n't have an airline up and running by then and labor loses the election there 'll be no airline much of the growth in domestic aviation in the 1950s , 1960s and 1970s was dominated by the rivalry between the privately owned ansett-ana and the government-supported taa vickers viscount turboprop aircraft were introduced in the 1950s and again proved immensely popular as a result of their smooth , vibration-free ride the policy was so strict that even newly purchased identical aircraft ( one from each airline ) were required on their delivery flights to enter australian airspace at exactly the same time the conservative government 's benevolent attitude towards ansett was epitomised in the 1950s when it forced taa to swap a number of its popular turbo-prop viscount aircraft with ansett-ana in return for slower and older , piston-engined douglas dc-6bs in the 1960s it introduced boeing 727-100 and mcdonnell douglas dc-9-30 whispering t-jets on primary routes as well as fokker f27 friendship jetliner turboprops on regional routes the federal government , although technically having deregulated the domestic aviation sector , made it effectively impossible for new entrant compass airlines to succeed although compass was controversially and perhaps inevitably forced out of business , australian 's days , and those of ansett , were numbered : the decision had been made at the federal government level to offer both government-owned carriers ( qantas and australian ) for sale the majority of the australian airlines branding was removed during the merger and replaced with qantas branding ; for instance , australian 's flight deck lounge became the qantas club the sole remaining australian airlines brand identity – the australian way ( inflight ) magazine – was rebranded as the qantas magazine in 2016 on 21 september 1982 , trans australia airlines flight 454 , operated by a mcdonnell douglas dc-9 registered vh-tjs , was the subject of an attempted robbery of 600,000 from the reserve bank of australia
