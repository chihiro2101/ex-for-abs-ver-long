one of the symptoms of conduct disorder is a lower level of fear research performed on the impact of toddlers exposed to fear and distress shows that negative emotionality ( fear ) predicts toddlers ' empathy-related response to distress if the caregiver is able to provide therapeutic intervention teaching children at risk better empathy skills , the child will have a lower incident level of conduct disorder conduct disorder can present with limited prosocial emotions , lack of remorse or guilt , lack of empathy , lack of concern for performance , and shallow or deficient affect currently , two possible developmental courses are thought to lead to conduct disorder the first is known as the '' childhood-onset type '' and occurs when conduct disorder symptoms are present before the age of 10 years specifically , children in this group have greater levels of adhd symptoms , neuropsychological deficits , more academic problems , increased family dysfunction and higher likelihood of aggression and violence it is also argued that some children may not in fact have conduct disorder , but are engaging in developmentally appropriate disruptive behavior individuals with adolescent-onset conduct disorder exhibit less impairment than those with the childhood-onset type and are not characterized by similar psychopathology at times , these individuals will remit in their deviant patterns before adulthood in addition to these two courses that are recognized by the dsm-iv-tr , there appears to be a relationship among oppositional defiant disorder , conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder specifically , research has demonstrated continuity in the disorders such that conduct disorder is often diagnosed in children who have been previously diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder , and most adults with antisocial personality disorder were previously diagnosed with conduct disorder for example , some research has shown that 90 % of children diagnosed with conduct disorder had a previous diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder moreover , both disorders share relevant risk factors and disruptive behaviors , suggesting that oppositional defiant disorder is a developmental precursor and milder variant of conduct disorder correspondingly , there is an established link between conduct disorder and the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder as an adult in fact , the current diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality disorder require a conduct disorder diagnosis before the age of 15 however , again , only 25-40 % of youths with conduct disorder will develop antisocial personality disorder nonetheless , many of the individuals who do not meet full criteria for antisocial personality disorder still exhibit a pattern of social and personal impairments or antisocial behaviors children with conduct disorder have a high risk of developing other adjustment problems in this way , there seems to be reciprocal effects of comorbidity with certain disorders , leading to increased overall risk for these youth adhd is the condition most commonly associated with conduct disorders , with approximately 25-30 % of boys and 50-55 % of girls with conduct disorder having a comorbid adhd diagnosis while it is unlikely that adhd alone is a risk factor for developing conduct disorder , children who exhibit hyperactivity and impulsivity along with aggression is associated with the early onset of conduct problems children with conduct disorder have an earlier onset of substance use , as compared to their peers , and also tend to use multiple substances while the cause of conduct disorder is complicated by an intricate interplay of biological and environmental factors , identifying underlying mechanisms is crucial for obtaining accurate assessment and implementing effective treatment despite the complexities , several domains have been implicated in the development of conduct disorder including cognitive variables , neurological factors , intraindividual factors , familial and peer influences , and wider contextual factors these factors may also vary based on the age of onset , with different variables related to early ( e.g the development of conduct disorder is not immutable or predetermined for example , the tendency to smoke during pregnancy ( sdp ) is subject to substantial genetic influence ( d'onofrio et al , 2007 ) , as is conduct disorder this provides a neural explanation for why youths with conduct disorder may be more likely to repeat poor decision making patterns according to dsm-5 criteria for conduct disorder , there are four categories that could be present in the child 's behavior : aggression to people and animals , destruction of property , deceitfulness or theft , and serious violation of rules the majority of research on conduct disorder suggests that there are a significantly greater number of males than females with the diagnosis , with some reports demonstrating a threefold to fourfold difference in prevalence
