in monarchies with either an uncodified or partly unwritten constitution ( such as the united kingdom or canada ) or a wholly written constitution that consists of a text augmented by additional conventions , traditions , letters patent , etc typically these powers are : to grant pardon ; to dismiss a prime minister ; to refuse to dissolve parliament ; and to refuse or delay royal assent to legislation ( to withhold royal assent amounts to a veto of a bill , while to reserve royal assent in effect amounts to a decision to neither grant nor refuse assent , but to delay taking a decision for an undetermined period ) there are usually strict constitutional conventions concerning when these powers may be used , and these conventions are enforced by public pressure in such an order , the reserve powers are thought to be the means by which the monarch and his or her viceregal representatives can legitimately exist as '' constitutional guardians '' or '' umpires '' , tasked with guaranteeing that cabinet and parliament adhere to the fundamental constitutional principles of the rule of law and responsible government itself some constitutional scholars , such as george winterton , have stated that reserve powers are a good thing in that they allow for a head of state to handle an unforeseen crisis and that the use of convention to limit the use of reserve powers allows for more gradual and subtle constitutional evolution than is possible through formal amendment of a written constitution evatt felt that the reserve powers could be codified and still serve their intended function in a responsible government system , as they do in ireland , japan , and sweden in belgium a constitutional provision explicitly states that no act of the monarch is valid without the signature of a member or members of the government , which thereby becomes solely responsible , hence excluding any reserve power for the crown in legal terminology , a competence vested in 'the king ' thus very often means the government , as opposed to formal laws which require a ( sometimes qualified ) parliamentary majority constitutional precedence has even established the unwritten but binding rule that the monarch must give assent to any parliamentary decision , regardless of any other considerations ( which can only be advanced in private audience with government members , not imposed ) , as soon as the government presents it for royal signature and thus assumes full political responsibility in 1990 , when a law liberalising belgium 's abortion laws was approved by parliament , king baudouin refused to give his royal assent , only the second time in belgium 's history the monarch elected to do so within the dominions , until the 1920s , most reserve powers were exercised by a governor-general on the advice of either the local or the british government , though the latter took precedence after the balfour declaration was produced by the 1926 imperial conference , formally establishing the autonomy and equal status of commonwealth governments , governors-general ceased to be advised in any way by the british government for example , the first governor-general of the irish free state , tim healy , was instructed by the british dominions office in 1922 to withhold the royal assent on any bill passed by the two houses of the oireachtas ( the irish parliament ) that attempted to change or abolish the oath of allegiance while the reserve power to dismiss a government has not been used in the united kingdom since 1834 , this power has been exercised more recently in australia , on two occasions : on 13 may 1932 , when the governor of new south wales philip game lang dismissal crisis on 11 november 1975 , when the governor-general of australia sir john kerr 1975 australian constitutional crisis owen dixon society ejournal ( gold coast , queensland : bond university , 2007 ) there was speculation on the potential exercise of vice-regal reserve power by campbell , in dismissing the premier in the absence of a parliamentary motion of no confidence barlow & corkery '' sir walter campbell '' , 28-29 these are among several exercises of the reserve powers in australia in the 20th century at state and federal levels donald markwell , '' griffith , barton and the early governor-generals : aspects of australia 's constitutional development '' , public law review , 1999 the reserve powers in canada fall within the royal prerogative and belong specifically to the monarch , as the constitution act , 1867 , vests all executive power in the country 's sovereign king george vi in 1947 issued letters patent permitting the governor general '' to exercise all powers and authorities lawfully belonging to us the monarch in respect of canada guichon refused this advice and instead asked john horgan to form a government , becoming the new premier peter hogg , a constitutional scholar , has opined that '' a system of responsible government can not work without a formal head of state who is possessed of certain reserve powers '' further , eugene forsey stated '' the reserve power is indeed , under our constitution , an absolutely essential safeguard of democracy they also had a real choice in selecting premiers – parliaments of the period being composed of independent members who formed loose and shifting factions – and were not always obliged to act on the advice of their ministers though the power of appointment is listed among the reserve powers , in fact the governor-general abides by strict conventions , and has always appointed the leader of the dominant party in the house of representatives the governor-general retains the theoretical power to appoint as prime minister a member of the house of representatives who clearly does not have the support of a majority of mps , but no governor-general has sought to use this power since new zealand gained responsible government , though some cabinets in the 19th century proved extremely short-lived today , however , the practice of appointing – on prime ministerial advice – a permanent deputy prime minister , who becomes acting prime minister when needed , has largely removed even this discretion from the governor-general likewise , by convention , the government as a whole remains in office as long as it keeps the confidence of the house however , all elections since responsible government was introduced , including snap elections , have been requested by the incumbent premier or prime minister , and are accordingly not examples of use of the reserve powers a prime minister who has lost the confidence of the house will conventionally either advise a dissolution of parliament and new elections , or tender his resignation likewise , if the prime minister tenders his resignation , the governor-general could theoretically refuse to accept it , and dissolve parliament against the prime minister 's advice a governor-general can also refuse a prime minister 's request to dissolve parliament and hold elections a governor-general could also legally refuse a request for a snap election from a prime minister in whom the house has confidence , but such a refusal would be extremely unlikely many constitutional commentators believe that the governor-general ( or the sovereign ) no longer has the power to refuse royal assent to any bill properly passed by the house of representatives - former law professor and prime minister sir geoffrey palmer and professor matthew palmer argue any refusal of royal assent would lead to a constitutional crisis a similar controversial power is the ability to refuse to make orders and regulations advised by the government or by individual ministers the outgoing prime minister , sir rob muldoon , had just lost an election , but refused to advise the governor-general , david beattie , to make urgent regulations desired not only by the incoming prime minister , david lange , but also by many in muldoon 's own party and cabinet a constitutional crisis occurred in saint kitts and nevis in 1981 , when the governor , sir probyn inniss , used his reserve powers to refuse assent to a bill passed by the government of sir kennedy simmonds , the country 's premier the constitution of tuvalu provides , in article 52 , that the governor-general exercises his powers '' only in accordance with the advice of ( a ) the cabinet ; or ( b ) the prime minister '' tuvalu ’ s opposition waiting to hear from gg '' , islands business , 1 july 2013 prime minister telavi responded that , under the constitution , he was only required to convene parliament once a year ( for a vote on the budget ) , and was thus under no obligation to summon it until december on 3 july , italeli exercised his reserve powers in ordering parliament to convene , against the prime minister 's wishes , on 30 july harold wilson , leading a minority government in 1974 , was advised elizabeth ii might refuse to dissolve parliament if she could identify an alternative prime minister able to command a cross-party majority this was last done in britain in 1963 when elizabeth ii appointed sir alec douglas-home as prime minister , on the advice of outgoing harold macmillan under the constitution of sweden , the supreme executive authority is the government ( composed of the prime minister and other cabinet ministers ) , which is responsible to the riksdag the german constitution limits the powers available to the president to prevent a situation in which the executive could effectively rule without legislative approval , which was the case in the weimar republic in addition to these powers , the president has various other discretionary powers in the constitution , which are of lesser political significance ( in normal circumstances )
