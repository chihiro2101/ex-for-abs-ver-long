the term klezmer comes from a combination of hebrew words : klei , meaning '' tools , utensils or instruments of '' and zemer , '' melody '' ; leading to k'lei zemer , literally '' instruments of music '' or '' musical instruments '' originally , klezmer referred to musical instruments , and was later extended to refer , as a pejorative , to musicians themselves early 20th century recordings and writings most often refer to the style as '' yiddish '' music , although it is also sometimes called freilech music ( yiddish , literally '' happy music '' ) the first recordings to use the term '' klezmer '' to refer to the music were the klezmorim 's east side wedding and streets of gold in 1977/78 , followed by andy statman and zev feldman 's jewish klezmer music in 1979 klezmer is easily identifiable by its characteristic expressive melodies , reminiscent of the human voice , complete with laughing and weeping a number of dreydlekh ( a yiddish word for ornament ( music ) ) , such as krekhts ( '' sobs '' ) are used to produce this style perhaps the strongest and most enduring is romanian music klezmer musicians heard and adapted traditional romanian music , which is reflected in the dance forms found throughout surviving klezmer music repertoire ( e.g it is unlikely that they played music recognizable as klezmer today since the style and structure of klezmer as we know it today is thought to have come largely from 19th century bessarabia , where the bulk of today 's traditional repertoire was written klezmorim were respected for their musical abilities and diverse repertoire , but they were by no means restricted to playing klezmer in ukraine they were banned from playing loud instruments , until the 19th century the first musician to play klezmer in european concerts , josef gusikov , played a type of xylophone which he invented and called a '' wood and straw instrument '' george gershwin was familiar with klezmer music , and the opening clarinet glissando of rhapsody in blue suggests this influence , although the composer did not compose klezmer directly dmitri shostakovich in particular admired klezmer music for embracing both the ecstasy and the despair of human life , and quoted several melodies in his chamber masterpieces , the piano quintet ( shostakovich ) ( 1940 ) , the piano trio no in the mid-to-late 1970s there was a klezmer revival in the united states and europe , led by giora feidman , the klezmorim , zev feldman , andy statman , and the klezmer conservatory band the 1980s saw a second wave of revival , as interest grew in more traditionally inspired performances with string instruments , largely with non-jews of the united states and germany in the 1990s , musicians from the san francisco bay area helped further interest in klezmer music by taking it into new territory the new orleans klezmer all-stars also formed in 1991 with a mixture of new orleans funk , jazz , and klezmer styles interest in klezmer has been sustained and supported by such well-known avant-garde jazz musicians as john zorn and don byron , who sometimes blend klezmer with jazz klezmer melodies have recently been incorporated into songs by third-wave ska band streetlight manifesto mames babegenush was formed in copenhagen , denmark , in 2004 out of strong scandinavian roots merged with traditional klezmer , influenced on the klezmer side by masters like naftule brandwein , abe schwartz and dave tarras today the band has developed a new sound of modern klezmer , pushing the perimeter of klezmer to incorporate many cultures and touring worldwide the band 's most recent album mames babegenush with strings ( 2017 ) was warmly received with 5-6 stars reviews in such magazines as songlines and froots starting in 2008 , '' the other europeans '' project , funded by several eu cultural institutions , spent a year doing intensive field research in moldavia under the leadership of alan bern and scholar zev feldman they wanted to explore klezmer and lăutari roots , and fuse the music of the two '' other european '' groups as with this ensemble , groups like di naye kapelye and yale strom & hot pstromi have incorporated rom musicians and elements since their inceptions a separate klezmer tradition had developed in israel in the 20th century clarinetists moshe berlin and avrum leib burstein are known exponents of the klezmer style in israel according to walter zev feldman , the klezmer dance repertoire seems to have been relatively uniform across the areas of jewish settlement in the russian empire however , there were several times in history where this transmission broke down , including mass emigration , but especially the holocaust , which destroyed most of jewish life and culture in europe few scions of klezmer dynasties remained in europe , one notable exception being leopold kozlowski of poland a few older klezmorim—such as leon schwartz , dave tarras , and german goldenshtayn—survived into the klezmer revival era and could recall some forgotten repertoire most klezmer pieces are for dancing to , from fast to slow tempo : freylekhs ( also bulgar , bulgarish & nbsp ; – literally '' bulgarian '' , volekhl/vulekhl & nbsp ; – literally '' wallachian '' , or '' romanian '' ) is an ( divided ) circle dance , usually in the ahava rabboh melodic mode the name '' bulgar '' ( yiddish '' bulgarish '' ) comes from the romanian traditional song and dance ( romanian bulgarească ) humoresque '' halaka '' dance , a traditional israeli dance from safed in galilee ; it has an ancient melody handed down from generation to generation klezmer is generally instrumental , although at weddings klezmorim traditionally accompanied the vocal stylings of the badkhn ( wedding entertainer ) 31 ( 387 ) of the 5th of april , 2002 percussion in early 20th-century klezmer recordings was generally minimal—no more than a wood block or snare drum barcelona gipsy
