data general ( dg ) was founded by several engineers from digital equipment corporation who were frustrated with dec 's management and left to form their own company the company was founded in hudson , massachusetts in 1968 the nova , like the pdp-8 , used a simple accumulator-based architecture it lacked general registers and the stack-pointer functionality of the more advanced pdp-11 , as did competing products , such as the hp 2100 ; compilers used hardware-based memory locations in lieu of a stack pointer announced as '' the best small computer in the world '' , the nova quickly gained a following , especially in scientific and educational markets , and made the company flush with cash dec sued for misappropriation of its trade secrets , data general corp several variations and upgrades to the supernova core followed in 1977 , dg launched a 16-bit microcomputer called the micronova to poor commercial success thumb in 1974 , the nova was supplanted by their upscale 16-bit machine , the eclipse based on many of the same concepts as the nova , it included support for virtual memory and multitasking more suitable to the small office environment the eclipse was originally intended to replace the nova outright , evidenced by the fact that the nova 3 series , released at the same time and utilizing virtually the same internal architecture as the eclipse , was phased out the next year while dg was still struggling with eclipse , in 1977 , digital announced the vax series , their first 32-bit minicomputer line , described as '' super-minis '' it appeared there was an enormous potential market for 32-bit machines , one that dg might be able to '' scoop '' ultimately , fountainhead was cancelled and eagle became the new mv series , with the first model , the data general eclipse mv/8000 , announced in april 1980 the eagle project was the subject of tracy kidder 's pulitzer prize-winning book , the soul of a new machine , making the mv line the best-documented computer project in recent history the mv systems generated an almost miraculous turnaround for data general one of data general 's significant customers at this time was the united states forest service , which starting in the mid-1980s used dg systems installed at all levels from headquarters in washington , d.c this required equipment of high reliability and generally rugged construction that could be deployed in a wide range of places , often to be maintained and used by people with no computer background at all the intent was to create new kinds of functional integration in an agency that had long prized its decentralized structure the mv series came in various iterations , from the mv/2000 ( later mv/2500 ) , mv/4000 , mv/10000 , mv/15000 , mv/20000 , mv/30000 , mv/40000 and ultimately concluded with the mv/60000ha minicomputer the mv/60000ha was intended to be a high availability system , with many components duplicated to eliminate the single point of failure yet , there were failures among the system 's many daughter boards , back-plane , and mid-plane in retrospect , the nicely performing mv series was too little , too late while the mv series did stop the erosion of dg 's customer base , this now smaller base was no longer large enough to allow dg to develop their next generation dg had also changed their marketing to focus on direct sales to fortune 100 companies and thus alienated many resellers data general developed operating systems for its hardware : dos and rdos for the nova , rdos and aos for the 16-bit eclipse c , m , and s lines , aos/vs and aos/vs ii for the eclipse mv line , and a modified version of unix system v called dg/ux for the eclipse mv and aviion machines the aos/vs software was the most commonly used dg software product and included cli ( command line interpreter ) allowing for complex scripting , dump/load , and other custom components related system software also in common use at the time included such packages as x.25 , xodiac , and tcp/ip for networking , fortran , cobol , rpg , pl/i , c and data general business basic for programming , infos ii and dg/dbms for databases , and the nascent relational database software dg/sql ceowrite was also offered on the dg one portable pln ( created by robert nichols ) was the host language for a number of dg products , making them easier to develop , enhance , and maintain than macro assembler equivalents the latter provided microcode acceleration of arithmetic and conversion operations for a wide range of now-arcane data types such as overpunch characters the dg easy product , a portable application platform developed by nichols and others from 1975 to 1979 but never marketed , had roots easily traceable back to the rpg vm created by stephen schleimer these products were popular with business customers because of their screen design feature and other ease-of-use features eventually , idea ran on every commercial hardware product from the micronova ( 4 users ) to the mv series under aos/vs , the same idea program running all those systems data general 's introduction of the data general-one ( dg-1 ) in 1984 is one of the few cases of a minicomputer company introducing a truly breakthrough pc product large installations in the past typically ran custom-developed software for a small range of tasks '' specifically '' , the report stated , '' dg should examine the unix market , where all of the needed software already exists , and see if dg can provide compelling unix solutions dg quickly responded by introduced new models of the aviion series based on a true commodity processor , the intel x86 series data general would be only one of many new england based computer companies , including the original digital equipment corporation , that collapsed or were sold to larger companies after the 1980s edward zander was product marketing manager at data general before his positions at apollo computer , sun microsystems and motorola as ceo
