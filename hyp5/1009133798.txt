nearby evidence within wonderwerk cave , at the edge of the kalahari desert , has been called the oldest known controlled fire ideally , campfires should be made in a fire ring if a fire ring is not available , a temporary fire site may be constructed alternatively , turf may be cut away to form a bare area and carefully replaced after the fire has cooled to minimize damage another way is to cover the ground with sand , or other soil mostly free of flammable organic material , to a depth of a few inches fire rings , however , do not fully protect material on the ground from catching fire having enough water nearby and a shovel to smother an out-of-control fire with dirt when extinguishing a campfire , using plenty of water or dirt , then stirring the mixture and add more water , then check that there are no burning embers left whatsoever never bury hot coals , as they can continue to burn and cause root fires or wildfires be aware of roots if digging a hole for your fire making sure the fire pit is large enough for the campfire and there are no combustibles near the campfire , and avoiding the construction of the campfire on a windy day there are , by conventional classification , three types of material involved in building a fire without manufactured fuels or modern conveniences such as lighters tinder lights easily and is used to start an enduring campfire kindling wood is an arbitrary classification including anything bigger than tinder but smaller than fuel wood in heavily used campsites , fuel wood can be hard to find , so it may have to purchased at a nearby store or be brought from home in most realistic cases nowadays , non-natural additions to the fuels mentioned above will be used most of them make no mention of fuelwoodâ€”in most designs , fuelwood is never placed on a fire until the kindling is burning strongly a separate tipi as a shell around the first one may work better one downside to a tipi fire is that when it burns , the logs become unstable and can fall over a log cabin fire-build likewise begins with a tinder pile the kindling is then stacked around it , as in the construction of a log cabin the first two kindling sticks are laid parallel to each other , on opposite sides of the tinder pile the second pair is laid on top of the first , at right angles to it , and also on opposite sides of the tinder the smallest kindling is placed over the top of the assembly however , these qualities make the log cabin an ideal cooking fire as it burns for a long period of time and can support cookware eventually , a pile of kindling burns between two pieces of fuelwood , and soon the logs catch fire from it its main difference from the standard log cabin is that it starts with thin pieces and moves up to thick pieces the hybrid is made by first erecting a small tipi and then proceeding to construct a log cabin around it a cross-fire is built by positioning two pieces of wood with the tinder in between once the fire is burning well , additional pieces of wood are placed on top in layers that alternate directions this type of fire creates coals suitable for cooking the smaller pieces of kindling are leaned against the big stick so that the tinder is enclosed between them in an alternative method , a large piece of fuelwood or log can be placed on the ground next to the tinder pile they also do not throw off much heat , which is n't needed for a ceremonial fire once large kindling is burning , all kindling is placed in the fire , then the fuel wood is placed on top of it ( unless , as in the rakovalkea fire-build , it is already there ) if a root , particularly a dead one , is exposed to fire , it may smoulder underground and ignite the parent tree long after the original fire is doused and the campers have left the area once the fire is covered thoroughly with sand , water is then added over the fire
