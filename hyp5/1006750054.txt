karl drais included a pivoting brake shoe that could be pressed against the rear iron tyre of his 1817 laufmaschine this was continued on the earliest bicycles with pedals , such as the boneshaker , which were fitted with a spoon brake to press onto the rear wheel the brake was operated by a lever or by a cord connecting to the handlebars the next development of the bicycle , the penny-farthings , were similarly braked with a spoon brake or by back pedalling during its development from 1870 to 1878 , there were various designs for brakes , most of them operating on the rear wheel however , as the rear wheel became smaller and smaller , with more of the rider 's weight over the front wheel , braking on the rear wheel became less effective the front brake , introduced by john kean in 1873 , had been generally adopted by 1880 because of its greater stopping power some penny-farthing riders used only back pedalling and got off and walked down steep hills , but most also used a brake having a brake meant that riders could coast down hill by taking their feet off the pedals and placing the legs over the handlebars , although most riders preferred to dismount and walk down steep hills an alternative to the spoon brake for penny-farthings was the caliper brake patented by browett and harrison in 1887 this early version of caliper braking used a rubber block to contact the outside of the penny-farthing 's small rear tyre these were typically equipped with a front spoon brake and no rear brake mechanism , but like penny-farthings they used fixed gears , allowing rear wheel braking by resisting the motion of the pedals the relative fragility of the wooden rims used on most bicycles still precluded the use of rim brakes in the late 1890s came the introduction of rim brakes and the freewheel with the introduction of mass-produced bicycle tire by the dunlop rubber , the use of spoon brakes began to decline , as they tended to quickly wear through the thin casing of the new tyres 594,234 , november 23 , 1897 the duck brake used a rod operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin rubber rollers against the front tyre , braking the front wheel 594,234 in 1898 , after the advent of freewheel coasting mechanisms , the first internal coaster brakes were introduced for the rear wheel the coaster brake was contained in the rear wheel hub , and was engaged and controlled by backpedaling , thus eliminating the issue of tyre wear in the united states , the coaster brake was the most commonly fitted brake throughout the first half of the 20th century , often comprising the only braking system on the bicycle whittbs , pp.153 & ndash ; 154 spoon brakes were used on penny farthings with solid rubber tyres in the 1800s and continued to be used after the introduction of the pneumatic-tyred safety bicycle the spoon brake consists of a pad ( often leather ) or metal shoe ( possibly rubber faced ) , which is pressed onto the top of the front tyre in developing world , a foot-operated form of the spoon brake sometimes is retrofitted to old rod brake roadsters perhaps more so than any other form of bicycle brake , the spoon brake is sensitive to road conditions and increases tyre wear dramatically jpg spoon brake on front wheel file : marian038.jpg improvised spoon brake on a chinese cargo tricycle braking power was enhanced by an extra-long brake lever mounted in parallel with and behind the handlebar , which provided additional leverage when braking ( two hands could be used to pull the lever if necessary ) used in combination with a rear coaster brake , a cyclist of the day could stop much more quickly and with better modulation of braking effort than was possible using only a spoon brake or rear coaster brake 198-233 : the spoon brake was fairly ineffective , while the coaster brake did not operate on the front tyre , the most effective position on a two-wheel vehicle during a hard stop rim brakes are so called because braking force is applied by friction pads to the rim of the rotating wheel , thus slowing it and the bicycle brake pads can be made of leather , rubber or cork and are often mounted in metal '' shoes '' because rims can carry debris from the ground to the brake pads , rim brakes are more prone to clogging with mud or snow than disc brakes ( where braking surfaces are higher from the ground ) , particularly when riding on unpaved surfaces the low price and ease of maintenance of rim brakes makes them popular in low- to mid-price commuter bikes , where the disadvantages are alleviated by the unchallenging conditions rim brakes require regular maintenance rim brakes require that the rims be straight ( not out-of-round or warped ) if a rim has a pronounced wobble , then the braking force may be intermittent or uneven , and the pads may rub the rims even when the brake is not applied in normal use this is not a problem , as the brakes are applied with limited force and for a short time , so the heat quickly dissipates to the surrounding air many consist of a replaceable rubber pad held on a mounting , or brake shoe , with a post or bolt on the back to attach to the brake the rubber can be softer for more braking force with less lever effort , or harder for longer life for wet-weather use , brake pads containing iron ( iii ) oxide are sometimes used as these have higher friction on a wet aluminum rim than the usual rubber these salmon-colored pads were first made by scott-mathauser and are now produced by kool-stop this wedges the shoes higher upon the tapered rim , thus increasing the normal force between shoes and rim surface thus the front brake is typically more effective than the rear when the brakes are so mounted they were often called '' stirrup brakes '' due to their shape rod brakes are used with a rim profile known as the westwood rim , which has a slightly concave area on the braking surface and lacks the flat outer surface required by brakes that apply the pads on opposite sides of the rim although heavy and complex , the linkages are reliable and durable and can be repaired or adjusted with simple hand tools the caliper brake is a class of cable-actuated brake in which the brake mounts to a single point above the wheel , theoretically allowing the arms to auto-centre on the rim arms extend around the tyre and end in brake shoes that press against the rim caliper brakes tend to become less effective as tyres get wider , and so deeper , reducing the brakes ' mechanical advantage '' single-pivot side-pull caliper brakes '' consist of two curved arms that cross at a pivot above the wheel and hold the brake pads on opposite sides of the rim these arms have extensions on one side , one attached to the cable , the other to the cable housing when the brake lever is squeezed , the arms move together and the brake pads squeeze the rim the centering of side-pull brakes was improved with the mass-market adoption of dual-pivot side-pulls ( an old design re-discovered by shimano in the early 1990s ) it is common to see professional racers climbing mountains with the quick-release undone on the rear brake , to eliminate drag from this source these brakes were reasonably priced , and in the past filled the price niche between the cheaper and the more expensive models of side-pull brakes '' u-brakes '' ( also known by the trademarked term '' 990-style '' ) are essentially the same design as the centre-pull caliper brake u-brakes were used on mountain bikes through the early 1990s , particularly under the chainstays , a rear brake mounting location that was then popular the cantilever brake is a class of brake in which each arm is attached to a separate pivot point on one side of the seat stay or fork the brake shoe is mounted above the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are drawn together because the arms move only in their designed arcs , the brake shoe must be adjustable in several planes thus cantilever brake shoes are notoriously difficult to adjust as the brake shoes of a second-class cantilever brake wears , they ride lower on the rim a disc brake consists of a metal disc , or '' rotor '' , attached to the wheel hub that rotates with the wheel with rim brakes , the first point that mud builds up on a mountain bike ridden in thick mud is usually the brakes disc brakes heat discs in the same way as rim brakes heat rims , but discs provide an inherently smaller surface to dissipate heat cable-actuated disc brakes were traditionally the only type of disc brake that could be used with the brake levers found on drop handlebars , sheldon brown , quoted at but this is no longer the case
