the iao was established after admiral john poindexter , former united states national security advisor to president ronald reagan , and saic executive brian hicks approached the us department of defense with the idea for an information awareness program after the attacks of 9/11 poindexter and hicks had previously worked together on intelligence-technology programs for the defense advanced research projects agency darpa agreed to host the program and appointed poindexter to run it in 2002 the iao began funding research and development of the total information awareness ( tia ) program in february 2003 but renamed the program the terrorism information awareness program in may that year after an adverse media reaction to the program 's implications for public surveillance although tia was only one of several iao projects , many critics and news reports conflated tia with other related research projects of the iao , with the result that tia came in popular usage to stand for an entire subset of iao programs the tia program itself was the '' systems-level '' program of the iao that intended to integrate information technologies into a prototype system to provide tools to better detect , classify , and identify potential terrorists with the goal to increase the probability that authorized agencies of the united states could preempt adverse actions as a systems-level program of programs , tia 's goal was the creation of a '' counter-terrorism information architecture '' that integrated technologies from other iao programs ( and elsewhere , as appropriate ) the tia program was researching , developing , and integrating technologies to virtually aggregate data , to follow subject-oriented link analysis , to develop descriptive and predictive models through data mining or human hypothesis , and to apply such models to additional datasets to identify terrorists and terrorist groups among the other iao programs that were intended to provide tia with component data aggregation and automated analysis technologies were the genisys , genisys privacy protection , evidence extraction and link discovery , and scalable social network analysis programs poindexter gave a speech at darpatech 2002 entitled '' overview of the information awareness office '' overview of the information awareness office in which he described the tia program in addition to the program itself , the involvement of poindexter as director of the iao also raised concerns among some , since he had been earlier convicted of lying to congress and altering and destroying documents pertaining to the iran-contra affair , although those convictions were later overturned on the grounds that the testimony used against him was protected the global information society project in this report , iao changed the name of the program to the terrorism information awareness program and emphasized that the program was not designed to compile dossiers on us citizens , but rather to research and develop the tools that would allow authorized agencies to gather information on terrorist networks as a result , house and senate negotiators moved to prohibit further funding for the tia program by adding provisions to the department of defense appropriations act , 2004 department of defense appropriations act , 2004 , pub further , the joint explanatory statement included in the conference committee report specifically directed that the iao as program manager for tia be terminated immediately evidence extraction and link discovery ( eeld ) developed technologies and tools for automated discovery , extraction and linking of sparse evidence contained in large amounts of classified and unclassified data sources ( such as phone call records from the nsa call database , internet histories , or bank records ) it was to develop the ability to detect patterns comprising multiple types of links between data items or people communicating ( e.g '' effective analysis across heterogenous databases '' means the ability to take things from databases which are designed to store different types of data—such as a database containing criminal records , a nsa call database and a foreign intelligence database the world wide web is considered an '' unstructured public data source '' because it is publicly accessible and contains many different types of data—such as blogs , emails , records of visits to web sites , etc.—all of which need to be analyzed and stored efficiently the intent is to create a core enabling technology ( technology that is used as a component for future technologies ) suitable for a wide range of future surveillance applications wanted : competent big brothers , newsweek , 8 february 2006 , retrieved 27 july 2007 legislators included a
