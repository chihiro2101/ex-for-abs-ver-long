toad ramsey of the louisville colonels in the old american association—his pitch likely resembled the knuckle curve—and eddie cicotte of the chicago white sox , who in 1908 was nicknamed '' knuckles '' , are two possible creators of the pitch image : eddiecicotte55.jpg right thumb 167px eddie cicotte , who is sometimes credited with inventing the knuckleball as used by cicotte , the knuckleball was originally thrown by holding the ball with the knuckles , hence the name of the pitch ed summers , a pittsburgh teammate of cicotte who adopted the pitch and helped develop it , modified it by holding the ball with his fingertips and using the thumb for balance this grip can also include digging the fingernails into the surface of the ball the fingertip grip is more commonly used today by knuckleball pitchers , like retired boston red sox pitcher tim wakefield , who had a knuckleball with a lot of movement there are other prominent knuckleball pitchers like hall of famer phil niekro , who had a very effective knuckler and knuckle curve , and cy young award winning pitcher r.a however , young pitchers with smaller hands tend to throw the knuckleball with their knuckles sometimes young players will throw the knuckleball with their knuckles flat against the ball , giving it less spin but also making it difficult to throw any significant distance regardless of how the ball is gripped , the purpose of the knuckleball is to have the least possible amount of rotational spin over the distance from the pitcher 's mound to home plate , the effect of these forces is that the knuckleball can flutter , dance , jiggle , or curve in two different directions during its flight a pitch thrown completely without spin is less desirable , however , than one with a very slight spin hitting a knuckleball is different enough from other aspects of baseball that players specifically prepare for the pitch during batting practice before games they expect it in according to physicist robert adair , due to the physiological limitation of human reaction time , a breaking knuckleball may be impossible to hit except by luck if a knuckleball does not change direction in mid-flight , however , then it is easy to hit due to its lack of speed ) since it typically only travels , far slower than the average major league fastball , it can be hit very hard if there is no movement to reduce the chances of having the knuckleball get hit for a home run , some pitchers will impart a slight topspin so that if no force causes the ball to dance , it will move downward in flight this is due to both the knuckleball 's low average speed and its erratic movement , which force the catcher to keep focusing on the ball even after the runners start stealing their next bases however , cicotte called the shine ball '' a pure freak of the imagination '' , claiming that he did this to disconcert hitters and that the pitch was still a knuckleball these include the flutterball , the floater , the dancer , the butterfly ball ( the name for the pitch used by french language game commentators employed by the montreal expos ) , the ghostball , and the bug '' former knuckleballer and pitching coach charlie hough says that the increased rarity of the knuckleball is due to scouts increasingly looking only for the best arm hoyt wilhelm , phil niekro , and jesse haines , three pitchers who primarily relied on the knuckleball , have been inducted into the baseball hall of fame you can pitch seven good innings with a knuckleball , and as soon as you walk a guy they go , 'see , there 's that damn knuckleball '' ferrell knew knuckleballs : he had the task of being the washington senators catcher in 1944-45 , when the senators had four knuckleball pitchers in their starting rotation when originally developed , the knuckleball was used by a number of pitchers as simply one pitch in their repertoire , usually as part of changing speeds from their fastball the '' knuckleball catcher '' is equipped with an oversized knuckleball catcher 's mitt , similar to a first baseman 's glove ; doug mirabelli , formerly of the red sox , used a softball catcher 's mitt list of knuckleball pitchers knuckleball ! , 2012 documentary
