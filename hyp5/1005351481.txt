mcdonnell f-4 phantom ii : the 1969 conversion to the f-4 was the most extensive in the team 's history although it met the criteria of demonstrating the capabilities of a prominent air force aircraft , the talon failed to fulfill the thunderbird tradition of flying front-line jet fighters flying high-performance fighter jets is inherently dangerous ; when flying in extremely close formation , the danger is compounded 9 may 1981 : capt nick hauck was killed in the crash of thunderbird no 3 aircraft sustained damage described by one of the thunderbirds pilots as a '' medium deep scratch '' to the red paint of the stabilator fitzgerald , commander of the team , and capt george nial , advance pilot and narrator , were killed during a training flight at nellis smith , commander of the thunderbirds , was killed when his aircraft ingested seagulls while taking off from cleveland , ohio the skyblazers were disbanded in january 1962 when their home squadron was rotated back to the united states and their assigned aircraft transitioned to the f-105 thunderchief the air force maintains a thunderbirds museum covering the history of the demonstration team
