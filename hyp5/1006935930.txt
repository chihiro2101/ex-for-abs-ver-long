chromosomes were first observed in plant cells by carl wilhelm von n√§geli in 1842 their behavior in animal ( salamander ) cells was described by walther flemming , the discoverer of mitosis , in 1882 in 1922 seems to have been the first person to define the karyotype as the phenotypic appearance of the somatic chromosomes , in contrast to their gene contents comparative karyological study of species muscari mill human chromosome 2 is now known to be a result of an end-to-end fusion of two ancestral ape chromosomes human chromosome 2 is a fusion of two ancestral chromosomes alec macandrew ; accessed 18 may 2006 in order for the giemsa stain to adhere correctly , all chromosomal proteins must be digested and removed for humans , white blood cells are used most frequently because they are easily induced to divide and grow in tissue culture the sex of an unborn fetus can be determined by observation of interphase cells ( see amniocentesis and barr body ) six different characteristics of karyotypes are usually observed and compared : differences in absolute sizes of chromosomes chromosomes can vary in absolute size by as much as twenty-fold between genera of the same family these differences probably reflect different amounts of dna duplication these differences probably came about through translocations these differences probably arose from segmental interchange of unequal lengths differences in basic number of chromosomes these differences could have resulted from successive unequal translocations which removed all the essential genetic material from a chromosome , permitting its loss without penalty to the organism ( the dislocation hypothesis ) or through fusion humans have one pair fewer chromosomes than the great apes satellites are small bodies attached to a chromosome by a thin thread heterochromatin consists mainly of genetically inactive and repetitive dna sequences as well as containing a larger amount of adenine-thymine pairs a full account of a karyotype may therefore include the number , type , shape and banding of the chromosomes , as well as other cytogenetic information the typical human karyotypes contain 22 pairs of autosome chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes ( allosomes ) the most common karyotypes for females contain two x chromosomes and are denoted 46 , xx ; males usually have both an x and a y chromosome denoted 46 , xy approximately 1.7 % percent of humans are intersex , sometimes due to variations in sex chromosomes in some cases there is even significant variation within species in some species , as in many sciaridae , entire chromosomes are eliminated during development in this process , found in some copepods and roundworms such as ascaris suum , portions of the chromosomes are cast away in particular cells this process is a carefully organised genome rearrangement where new telomeres are constructed and certain heterochromatin regions are lost suum , all the somatic cell precursors undergo chromatin diminution the inactivation of one x chromosome takes place during the early development of mammals ( see barr body and dosage compensation ) in placental mammals , the inactivation is random as between the two xs ; thus the mammalian female is a mosaic in respect of her x chromosomes when they looked at the karyotype of the closely related indian muntjac , muntiacus muntjak , they were astonished to find it had female 6 , male 7 chromosomes the number of chromosomes in the karyotype between ( relatively ) unrelated species is hugely variable the high record would be somewhere amongst the ferns , with the adder 's tongue fern ophioglossum ahead with an average of 1262 chromosomes the fundamental number , fn , of a karyotype is the number of visible major chromosomal arms per set of chromosomes humans have fn 82 , due to the presence of five acrocentric chromosome pairs : 13 , 14 , 15 , 21 , and 22 ( the human y chromosome is also acrocentric ) ploidy is the number of complete sets of chromosomes in a cell in many instances , endopolyploid nuclei contain tens of thousands of chromosomes ( which can not be exactly counted ) abnormalities in chromosome number usually cause a defect in development edwards syndrome is caused by trisomy ( three copies ) of chromosome 18 down syndrome , a common chromosomal disease , is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 angelman syndrome & ndash ; 50 % of cases have a segment of the long arm of chromosome 15 missing ; a deletion of the maternal genes , example of imprinting disorder
