it would appear that some of the earliest empirical explorations of mindset originated in the early 1900s ( gollwitzer 1990 , 2012 ) the attention to mindset within the study of cognitive psychology has continued relatively unabated in addition to the field of cognitive psychology , the use of mindset is evident within the social sciences and several other fields ( e.g a characteristic of this area of study , in all its various manifestations , is the fragment use of mindset throughout the academy ( e.g although most consider that this mindset usefully served to prevent an attack by either country , the assumptions underlying deterrence theory have made assessments of the efficacy of the cold war mindset a matter of some controversy most theorists consider that the key responsibility of an embedded power group is to challenge the assumptions that comprise the group 's own mindset according to these commentators , power groups that fail to review or revise their mindsets with sufficient regularity can not hold power indefinitely , as a single mindset is unlikely to possess the flexibility and adaptability needed to address all future events for example , the variations in mindset between democratic party and republican party presidents in the u.s may have made that country more able to challenge assumptions than the kremlin with its more static bureaucracy modern military theory attempts to challenge entrenched mindsets in dealing with asymmetric warfare , terrorism , and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction firstly , an institution with an entrepreneurial philosophy will set entrepreneurial goals and strategies as a whole , but maybe even more importantly , it will foster an entrepreneurial milieu , allowing each entity to pursue emergent opportunities even amongst scholars within the same disciple studying the same mindset , substantial variations exist ( french , 2016 ) mindset theory , as based on the cultural values defined by sagiv and schwarts , explains the nature , functions , and variables that make up the characteristics of personality the mindscape theory and cultural values outlined by sagive and schwarts combine to make a more comprehensive whole of mindset agency theory similar to the mbti , the mindscapes of maruyama seek to measure individuals on a scale of characteristics and placed into four categories of personalities that make up the population of the world each contain differing views toward information , perception , logic , and ethics these dimensions contain opposites in the realms of cognitive , figurative , and operative values : cognitive : embeddedness or autonomy figurative : mastery or harmony operative : hierarchy or egalitarian fixed and growth mindset dweck states that there are two categories ( growth mindset versus fixed mindset ) that can group individuals based on their behaviour , specifically their reaction to failure people with a '' fixed mindset '' believe that abilities are mostly innate and interpret failure as the lack of necessary basic abilities , while those with a '' growth mindset '' believe that they can acquire any given ability provided they invest effort or study according to dweck , individuals with a '' growth '' mindset are more likely to continue working hard despite setbacks in order for students to effectively adopt a growth mindset , a classroom culture needs to be established that nurtures this type of thinking according to dweck 2010 , '' the teacher should portray challenges as fun and exciting , while portraying easy tasks as boring and less useful for the brain '' students who are engaged in more challenging learning activities , have more opportunities to make mistakes and struggle , allowing the teacher to interject with some new strategies to try while praising students for the work they have done so far a second strategy to promote a growth-mindset culture in the classroom is to explicitly teach lessons related to what it means to adopt a growth mindset possible activities include establishing personal goals , writing letters , or having students share with one another something they used to be poor at and now are very good at the way educators evaluate their students ' work and communicate their progress can also contribute to the establishment of a growth mindset culture in the classroom more specifically , dweck ( 2010 ) identifies the word '' yet '' as a valuable tool to assess students learning while elements of our personality – such as sensitivity to mistakes and setbacks – can make us predisposed towards holding a certain mindset , we are able to develop and reshape our mindset through our interactions while a great deal of research in the education field has focused on a students ability to adopt a growth mindset , less attention and focus has been given to teacher mindsets and the role they play in influencing their students this suggests the need for more teacher training and support in order for teachers to be able to successfully implement growth mindset initiatives in their classrooms boaler said , '' the key growth mindset message was that effort changes the brain by forming new connections , and that students control this process in 2015 , ashley buchanan proposed a complementary evolution to the fixed and growth mindset called the benefit mindset according to chris argyris ( 2004 ) , there are two dominant mindsets in organizations : the productive mindset and the defensive mindset
