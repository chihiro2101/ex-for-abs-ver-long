succinylcholine chloride injection indicated , in addition to general anesthesia , to facilitate tracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation its medical uses are limited to short-term muscle relaxation in anesthesia and intensive care , usually for facilitation of endotracheal intubation it may be better than rocuronium in people without contraindications due to its faster onset of action and shorter duration of action it is indicated , in addition to general anesthesia , to facilitate tracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation suxamethonium is also commonly used as the sole muscle relaxant during electroconvulsive therapy , favoured for its short duration of action suxamethonium is quickly degraded by plasma butyrylcholinesterase and the duration of effect is usually in the range of a few minutes side effects include malignant hyperthermia , muscle pains , acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia , transient ocular hypertension , constipation and changes in cardiac rhythm , including bradycardia , and cardiac arrest in people with neuromuscular disease or burns , an injection of suxamethonium can lead to a large release of potassium from skeletal muscles , potentially resulting in cardiac arrest a typical increase of potassium ion serum concentration on administration of suxamethonium is 0.5 & nbsp ; mmol per liter high blood potassium does not generally result in adverse effects below a concentration of 6.5 to 7 meq per liter malignant hyperthermia ( mh ) from suxamethonium administration can result in a drastic and uncontrolled increase in skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism the normal short duration of action of suxamethonium is due to the rapid metabolism of the drug by non-specific plasma cholinesterases such genes will result in a longer duration of action of the drug , ranging from 20 minutes up to several hours suxamethonium has a longer duration of effect than acetylcholine , and is not hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase
