thumb the parabolic shape of a dish reflects the signal to the dish ’ s focal point direct broadcast satellite dishes use an lnbf , which integrates the feedhorn with the lnb a typical value for a consumer type 60 & nbsp ; cm satellite dish at 11.75 & nbsp ; ghz is 37.50 & nbsp ; db with lower frequencies , c-band for example , dish designers have a wider choice of materials the large size of dish required for lower frequencies led to the dishes being constructed from metal mesh on a metal framework for instance , one bbc news downlink shows a '' red signal '' being received by the lnbf directly instead of being beamed to the dish , which because of its parabolic shape will collect the signal into a smaller area and deliver it to the lnbf prior to the existence of direct broadcast satellite services , home users would generally have a motorised c-band dish of up to 3 m in diameter for reception of channels from different satellites in the lnb they become down converted to 950–2150 & nbsp ; mhz , which is the frequency range allocated for the satellite service on the coaxial cable between lnbf and receiver in a single receiver residential installation there is a single coaxial cable running from the receiver set-top box in the building to the lnb on the dish thumb a satellite finder ( or sat finder ) is a satellite field strength meter used to accurately point satellite dishes at communications satellites in geostationary orbit with diseqc and usals , the satellite dish will automatically aim itself at one of sixteen satellites programmed in previously when pressing one of the channel buttons on the remote automatic tracking satellite dish satellitedish1.jpg general electric satellite dish for directv satellite television the term satellite dish was coined in 1978 during the beginning of the satellite television industry , and came to refer to dish antennas that send and/or receive signals from communications satellites the first satellite television dishes were built to receive signals on the c-band analog , and were very large this was the first widely used direct-broadcast satellite television system and allowed dishes as small as 20 & nbsp ; inches to be used this great decrease of dish size also allowed satellite dishes to be installed on vehicles
