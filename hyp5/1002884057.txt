unlike many other maples , mature trees do not tend to develop a shaggy bark the seeds are disc-shaped , strongly flattened , across and thick under ideal conditions in its native range , norway maple may live up to 250 years , but often has a much shorter life expectancy ; in north america , for example , sometimes only 60 years the norway maple is a member ( and is the type species ) of the section platanoidea pax , characterised by flattened , disc-shaped seeds and the shoots and leaves containing milky sap other related species in this section include acer campestre ( field maple ) , acer cappadocicum ( cappadocian maple ) , acer lobelii ( lobel 's maple ) , and acer truncatum ( shandong maple ) from the field maple , the norway maple is distinguished by its larger leaves with pointed , not blunt , lobes , and from the other species by the presence of one or more teeth on all of the lobes the tips of the points on norway maple leaves reduce to a fine '' hair '' , while the tips of the points on sugar maple leaves are , on close inspection , rounded on mature trees , sugar maple bark is more shaggy , while norway maple bark has small , often criss-crossing grooves while the shape and angle of leaf lobes vary somewhat within all maple species , the leaf lobes of norway maple tend to have a more triangular shape , in contrast to the more squarish lobes often seen on sugar maples as with most maples , norway maple is normally dioecious ( separate male and female trees ) , occasionally monoecious , and trees may change gender from year to year norway maple seeds are flattened , while those of sugar maple are globose the sugar maple usually has a brighter orange autumn color , where the norway maple is usually yellow , although some of the red-leaved cultivars appear more orange leafout of norway maple is tied to photoperiod and initiated when day lengths reach approximately 13 hours , which is generally in april this species as grown in the former yugoslavia is also called bosnian maple , and is probably the maple used by the famous italian violin makers , stradivari and guarneri the norway maple was introduced to northeastern north america between 1750 and 1760 as an ornamental shade tree the larvae of a number of species of lepidoptera feed on norway maple foliage
