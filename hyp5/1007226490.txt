quorum sensing was first reported in 1970 , by kenneth nealson , terry platt , and j because they attributed this conditioning of the medium to the growing population of cells itself , they referred to the phenomenon as autoinducer some of the best-known examples of quorum sensing come from studies of bacteria bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate certain phenotype expressions , which in turn , coordinate their behaviours certain bacteria are able to use quorum sensing to regulate bioluminescence , nitrogen fixation and spore it can occur within a single bacterial species , as well as between diverse species both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria use quorum sensing , but there are some major differences in their mechanisms for the bacteria to use quorum sensing constitutively , they must possess three characteristics : to secrete a signaling molecule , an autoinducer , to detect the change in concentration of signaling molecules , and to regulate gene transcription as a response qs signaling molecules are usually secreted at a low level by individual bacteria at low cell density , the molecules may just diffuse away at high cell density , the local concentration of signaling molecules may exceed its threshold level , and trigger changes in gene expression when gram-positive bacteria detect high concentration of aips in their environment , that happens by way of aips binding to a receptor to activate a kinase another possible mechanism is that aip is transported into the cytosol , and binds directly to a transcription factor to initiate or inhibit transcription gram-negative bacteria produce n-acyl homoserine lactone ( ahl ) as their signaling molecule some gram-negative bacteria may use the two-component system as well moreover , a study showed that these host associated curvibacter bacteria produce a broad spectrum of ahl , explaining the presence of those operons as mentioned before , ahl are the quorum sensing molecules of gram-negative bacteria , which means curvibacter has a quorum sensing activity indeed , due to the oxidoreductase activity of hydra , there is a modification of ahl signalling molecules ( 3-oxo-homoserine lactone into 3-hydroxy-homoserine lactone ) which leads to a different host-microbe interaction on one hand , a phenotypic switch of the colonizer curvibacter takes place on the other hand , this switch modifies its ability to colonize the epithelial cell surfaces of hydra vulgaris indeed , one explanation is that with a 3-oxo-hsl quorum-sensing signal , there is an up-regulation of flagellar assembly coli ) , cell division may be partially regulated by ai-2-mediated quorum sensing part of it encodes an abc transporter , which imports ai-2 into the cells during the early stationery ( latent ) phase of growth transcription of the lsr operon is also thought to be inhibited by dihydroxyacetone phosphate ( dhap ) through its competitive binding to lsrr however , they have a receptor that detects ahls from other bacteria and change their gene expression in accordance with the presence of other '' quorate '' populations of gram-negative bacteria salmonella does not detect ahl when passing through the gastrointestinal tracts of several animal species , suggesting that the normal microbiota does not produce ahls another form of gene regulation that allows the bacteria to rapidly adapt to surrounding changes is through environmental signaling disrupting the signaling process in this way is called quorum sensing inhibition also show quorum sensing activity have been isolated from various infected sites from patients ( bile , blood , peritoneal fluid , pus , stool and urine ) the yenr and yeni proteins produced by the gammaproteobacterium yersinia enterocolitica are similar to aliivibrio fischeri luxr and luxi three-dimensional structures of proteins involved in quorum sensing were first published in 2001 , when the crystal structures of three luxs orthologs were determined by x-ray crystallography many bacterial species , including e researchers have developed novel molecules which block the signalling receptors of bacteria ( '' quorum quenching '' ) mbtl is a compound that has been shown to inhibit quorum sensing and decrease the amount of cell death by a significant amount a comparison between the proteobacteria phylogeny as generated by 16s ribosomal rna sequences and phylogenies of luxi- , luxr- , or luxs-homologs shows a notably high level of global similarity quorum quenching is the process of preventing quorum sensing by disrupting signalling we can characterize this as quorum quenching since there is an interference with quorum sensing molecules the quorum sensing process in honey bees is similar to the method used by temnothorax ants in several ways quorum sensing can also be used to coordinate the behavior of autonomous robot swarms
