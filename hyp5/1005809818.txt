when performing block-based discrete cosine transform ( dct ) coding for quantization , as in jpeg-compressed images , several types of artifacts can appear for example , the numbers '' 6 '' and '' 8 '' may get replaced at low bit rates , any lossy block-based coding scheme introduces visible artifacts in pixel blocks and at block boundaries these boundaries can transform block boundaries , prediction block boundaries , or both , and may coincide with macroblock boundaries the transform ( for example the discrete cosine transform ) is applied to a block of pixels , and to achieve lossy compression , the transform coefficients of each block are quantized statistically , images have more low-frequency than high-frequency content , so it is the low-frequency content that remains after quantization , which results in blurry , low-resolution blocks various approaches have been proposed to reduce image compression effects , but to use standardized compression/decompression techniques and retain the benefits of compression ( for instance , lower transmission and storage costs ) , many of these methods focus on '' post-processing '' â€”that is , processing images when received or viewed instead of just multiplying the quantized coefficients with the quantisation step pertaining to the 2d-frequency , intelligent noise in the form of a random number in the interval can be added to the dequantized coefficient when motion prediction is used , as in mpeg-1 , mpeg-2 or mpeg-4 , compression artifacts tend to remain on several generations of decompressed frames , and move with the optic flow of the image , leading to a peculiar effect , part way between a painting effect and '' grime '' that moves with objects in the scene in motion compensated video compression , the current picture is predicted by shifting blocks ( macroblocks , partitions , or prediction units ) of pixels from previously decoded frames video compression artifacts include cumulative results of compression of the comprising still images , for instance ringing or other edge busyness in successive still images appear in sequence as a shimmering blur of dots around edges , called mosquito noise , as they resemble mosquitoes swarming around the object p.930 ( 08/96 ) principles of a reference impairment system for video the so-called '' mosquito noise '' is caused by the block-based discrete cosine transform ( dct ) compression algorithm used in most video coding standards , such as the mpeg formats in still images , an example is jpegs by german photographer thomas ruff , which uses intentional jpeg artifacts as the basis of the picture 's style
