there is no provision for the role of political parties in the united states constitution , since the founding fathers did not originally intend for american politics to be partisan thus in the first two presidential elections , the electoral college handled the nominations and elections in 1789 and 1792 that selected george washington richard hofstadter , the idea of a party system : the rise of legitimate opposition in the united states , 1780–1840 ( 1970 ) gordon s wood , empire of liberty : a history of the early republic , 1789–1815 ( oxford history of the united states ) starting with the 1796 election , congressional party or a state legislature party caucus selected the party 's presidential candidates before 1820 , democratic-republican members of congress would nominate a single candidate from their party delegates to the national convention were usually selected at state conventions whose own delegates were chosen by district conventions sometimes they were dominated by intrigue between political bosses who controlled delegates ; the national convention was far from democratic or transparent progressive era reformers looked to the primary election as a way to measure popular opinion of candidates , as opposed to the opinion of the bosses the wisconsin direct open primary of 1905 was the first to eliminate the caucus and mandate direct selection of national convention delegates in 1910 , oregon became the first state to establish a presidential preference primary , which requires delegates to the national convention to support the winner of the primary at the convention the primary received its first major test in the 1912 election pitting incumbent president william howard taft against challengers theodore roosevelt and robert la follette roosevelt proved the most popular candidate , but as most primaries were non-binding '' preference '' shows and held in only fourteen of the-then forty-eight states , the republican nomination went to taft , who controlled the convention the first-in-the-nation new hampshire primary has since become a widely observed test of candidates ' viability the impetus for national adoption of the binding primary election was the chaotic 1968 democratic national convention a large number of states , faced with the need to conform to more detailed rules for the selection of national delegates , chose a presidential primary as an easier way to come into compliance with the new national democratic party rules the result was that many more future delegates would be selected by a state presidential primary the republicans also adopted many more state presidential primaries with the broadened use of the primary system , states have tried to increase their influence in the nomination process one tactic has been to create geographic blocs to encourage candidates to spend time in a region vermont and massachusetts attempted to stage a joint new england primary on the first tuesday of march , but new hampshire refused to participate so it could retain its traditional place as the first primary the first regional primary was the southern super tuesday of march 8 , 1988 , in which nine states united in the idea that a candidate would reflect regional interests the 1988 presidential election in the south : continuity amidst change in southern party politics ( 1991 ) pp 3–20 it failed as all but two of the eight major candidates won at least one primary on that day another trend is to stage earlier and earlier primaries , given impetus by super tuesday and the mid-1990s move ( since repealed ) of the california primary and its bloc of votes—the largest in the nation—from june to march to retain its tradition as the first primary in the country ( and adhere to a state law which requires it to be ) , new hampshire moved their primary forward , from early march to early january a major reason states try to increase their influence , and vie for earlier primaries , is that in recent years the races have usually been decided before the primary season has ended in june for example , john mccain officially clinched the 2008 republican presidential nomination in march , while during that same month barack obama held a substantial lead in pledged delegates in the democratic party primaries in 2012 , both the republicans and the democrats moved their florida primary to january 31 , which was an earlier date than past election cycles in response , other states also changed their primary election dates for 2012 , in order to claim a greater influence , creating a cascade of changes in other states this followed what happened in 2008 when nevada moved its caucuses to january , causing other states to also move their primaries to earlier dates on the other hand , as stated above , the primaries and caucuses are non-governmental party affairs in the two major party 's rules , '' territories '' are referred to as '' states '' , which can be carried over in discussion and media implying there are more than 50 states an incumbent president seeking re-election usually faces no opposition during their respective party 's primaries , especially if they are still popular bush and barack obama , for example , their respective paths to nomination became uneventful and the races become merely pro forma ; all four then went on to win a second presidential term senator ted kennedy then carried 12 states while running against carter during the 1980 democratic party primaries ; reagan then defeated carter in the fall pat buchanan captured a decent percentage of a protest vote against george h.w both major political parties of the u.s.—the democratic party and the republican party—officially nominate their candidate for president at their respective national conventions each of these conventions is attended by a number of delegates selected in accordance with the given party 's bylaws the results of the presidential primaries and caucuses bind many of these delegates , known as pledged delegates , to vote for a particular candidate these are each states ' two national committeepersons and the state chairperson in democratic primaries through 2016 , about 85 % of delegates to the democratic national convention are '' pledged delegates '' who are apportioned to candidates according to the results of primaries and caucuses franchise in a primary or caucus is governed by rules established by the state party , although the states may impose other regulations in many of those states that have proportional vote primaries , a candidate must meet a certain threshold in the popular vote to be given delegates a handful of states may also practice non-binding '' beauty contests '' , which are public opinion surveys for use by caucus delegates to select candidates to a state convention , which then in turn selects delegates to the national convention in many states , only voters registered with a party may vote in that party 's primary , known as a closed primary in some states , a semi-closed primary is practiced , in which voters unaffiliated with a party ( independents ) may choose a party primary in which to vote a semi-open primary occurs when a voter must choose a party-specific ballot to cast , instead of being provided a single ballot where the voter must choose on the ballot itself which party 's primary to vote in a few states once staged a blanket primary , in which voters could vote for one candidate in multiple primaries , but the practice was struck down by the u.s both the democratic party and the republican party usually modify their delegate selection rules between presidential elections , including how delegates are allocated to each state and territory states and territories who schedule their primary or caucus later in the primary season may also get additional bonus delegates house of representatives , and whether its electoral college votes went to the republican candidate in the last presidential election in reaction to these moves , both the democratic and republican national committees imposed a timing adjustment of scheduling rules , stripping states of delegates if they move their primaries early , such as the case in both the florida democratic primary and the florida republican primary in 2008 pat buchanan 's 2nd place showing in the 1992 and win in the 1996 new hampshire primaries coincided with the weakness of the future republican party presidential nominees , incumbent george h california and new jersey moved their primaries to february for the 2008 election , but in 2012 both states ended up moving them back to june in addition , his plan would allow for a few small population states , such as iowa and new hampshire , to hold their primaries in advance of the first region in the 2008 republican primary , states that ran early primaries were punished by a reduction of 50 % in the number of delegates they could send to the national convention
