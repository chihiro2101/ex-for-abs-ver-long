there had been debate over whether to classify this species as lynx rufus or felis rufus as part of a wider issue regarding whether the four species of lynx should be given their own genus , or be placed as a subgenus of felis the genus lynx is now accepted , and the bobcat is listed as lynx rufus in modern taxonomic sources the genus lynx shares a clade with the genetic lineages puma , prionailurus and felis dated to ; lynx diverged approximately the bobcat is believed to have evolved from the eurasian lynx , which crossed into north america by way of the bering land bridge during the pleistocene , with progenitors arriving as early as 2.6 million years ago the first wave moved into the southern portion of north america , which was soon cut off from the north by glaciers this population evolved into modern bobcats around 20,000 years ago a second population arrived from asia and settled in the north , developing into the modern canada lynx 13 bobcat subspecies have been historically recognized based on morphological characteristics : l rufus ( schreber ) – eastern and midwestern united states l gigas ( bangs ) – northern new york to nova scotia and new brunswick l floridanus ( rafinesque ) – southeastern united states and inland to the mississippi valley , up to southwestern missouri and southern illinois l baileyi ( merriam ) – southwestern united states and northwestern mexico l pallescens ( merriam ) – northwestern united states and southern british columbia , alberta , and saskatchewan l the bobcat resembles other species of the midsize genus lynx , but is on average the smallest of the four its coat is variable , though generally tan to grayish-brown , with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail the ears are black-tipped and pointed , with short , black tufts generally , an off-white color is seen on the lips , chin , and underparts bobcats in the desert regions of the southwest have the lightest-colored coats , while those in the northern , forested regions are darkest kittens are born well-furred and already have their spots adult males can range in weight from , with an average of ; females at , with an average of dk adult ( 2005 ) , the largest bobcat accurately measured on record weighed , although unverified reports have them reaching union leader the largest-bodied bobcats are from eastern canada and northern new england of the subspecies l the home range is marked with feces , urine scent , and by clawing prominent trees in the area '' patterns in bobcat ( lynx rufus ) scent marking and communication behaviors the sizes of bobcats ' home ranges vary significantly ; a world conservation union ( iucn ) summary of research suggests ranges from one study in kansas found resident males to have ranges of roughly , and females less than half that area transient bobcats were found to have both larger ( roughly and less well-defined home ranges when multiple territories overlap , a dominance hierarchy is often established , resulting in the exclusion of some transients from favored areas in line with widely differing estimates of home range size , population density figures are divergent , from one to 38 bobcats per in one survey one study noted a dense , unhunted population in california had a sex ratio of 2.1 males per female the bobcat is able to survive for long periods without food , but eats heavily when prey is abundant its main prey varies by region : in the eastern united states , it is the eastern cottontail and new england cottontail , and in the north , it is the snowshoe hare in the far south , the rabbits and hares are sometimes replaced by cotton rats as the primary food source birds up to the size of an adult trumpeter swan are also taken in ambushes , along with their fledglings and eggs status of missouri 's experimental trumpeter swan restoration program the bobcat hunts animals of different sizes , and adjusts its hunting techniques accordingly bobcats are also occasional hunters of livestock and poultry according to the national agricultural statistics service , bobcats killed 11,100 sheep in 2004 , comprising 4.9 % of all sheep predator deaths however , some amount of bobcat predation may be misidentified , as bobcats have been known to scavenge on the remains of livestock kills by other animals it has been known to kill deer or pronghorn , and sometimes to hunt elk in western north america , especially in winter when smaller prey is scarce , or when deer populations become more abundant one study in the everglades showed a large majority of kills ( 33 of 39 ) were fawns , according to the yellowstone showed a large amount of kills ( 15 of 20 ) were includes elk calves , but prey up to eight times the bobcat 's weight could be successfully taken the bobcat prey base overlaps with that of other midsized predators of a similar ecological niche however , other studies have found bobcat populations may decrease in areas with high coyote populations , with the more social inclination of the canid giving them a possible competitive advantage with the canada lynx , however , the interspecific competition affects distribution patterns ; competitive exclusion by the bobcat is likely to have prevented any further southward expansion of the range of its felid relative bobcats generally begin mating by their second summer , though females may start as early as their first year like other lynx species , bobcats probably avoid encounters with bears , in part because they are likely to lose kills to them or may rarely be attacked by them aubry , keith and rale , catherine ( july 2006 ) ecological characteristics of fishers ( martes pennanti ) in the southern oregon cascade range the bobcat may have external parasites , mostly ticks and fleas , and often carries the parasites of its prey , especially those of rabbits and squirrels its population in canada is limited due to both snow depth and the presence of the canadian lynx
