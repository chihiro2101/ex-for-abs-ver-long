desmostylians were large , fully aquatic quadrupeds with massive limbs and short tails the smallest is ashoroa laticosta , a relatively large animal at a body length of 168 & nbsp ; cm , while the largest species reached sizes comparable to steller 's sea cow the cusps of the premolars and molars are composed of densely packed cylinders of thick enamel , giving the order its name ( '' bundle of columns '' ) the cheek teeth are brachydont and bunodont in primitive genera , but hypsodont in later genera such as desmostylus , which has many supernumerary cusps their dental and skeletal forms suggest that desmostylians were aquatic herbivores dependent on littoral habitats ) however , a more recent and detailed analysis of desmostylian bone structure has revealed them to be fully aquatic , like sirenians and cetaceans , with their limbs being incapable of supporting their own weight on land the type species desmostylus hesperus was originally classified from a few teeth and vertebrae as a sirenian by , but doubts arose a decade later when more complete fossils were discovered in japan a major find was announced in october 2015 after scientists examined an extensive group of giant , tusked , quadruped , marine mammal fossils photos : new species of extinct marine mammal identified from unalaska fossils , alaska dispatch news , mike dunham , october 7 , 2015 douglas emlong 's 1971 discovery of the new genus behemotops from oregon showed that early desmostylians had more proboscidean-like teeth and jaws than later ones
