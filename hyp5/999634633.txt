in 1932 , jan oort became the first to report that measurements of the stars in the solar neighborhood indicated that they moved faster than expected when a mass distribution based upon visible matter was assumed , but these measurements were later determined to be essentially erroneous in 1939 , horace babcock reported in his phd thesis measurements of the rotation curve for andromeda which suggested that the mass-to-luminosity ratio increases radially he attributed that to either the absorption of light within the galaxy or to modified dynamics in the outer portions of the spiral and not to any form of missing matter a companion paper by maarten schmidt showed that this rotation curve could be fit by a flattened mass distribution more extensive than the light these results suggested that either gravity does not apply universally or that , conservatively , upwards of 50 % of the mass of galaxies was contained in the relatively dark galactic halo it is also observed that galaxies with a uniform distribution of luminous matter have a rotation curve that rises from the center to the edge , and most low-surface-brightness galaxy ( lsb galaxies ) have the same anomalous rotation curve the material responsible for the extra mass was dubbed dark matter , the existence of which was first posited in the 1930s by jan oort in his measurements of the oort constants and fritz zwicky in his studies of the masses of galaxy clusters in order to accommodate a flat rotation curve , a density profile for a galaxy and its environs must be different than one that is centrally concentrated since observations of galaxy rotation do not match the distribution expected from application of kepler 's laws , they do not match the distribution of luminous matter this implies that spiral galaxies contain large amounts of dark matter or , in alternative , the existence of exotic physics in action on galactic scales so , while state-of-the-art cosmological and galaxy formation simulations of dark matter with normal baryonic matter included can be matched to galaxy observations , there is not yet any straightforward explanation as to why the observed scaling relationship exists additionally , detailed investigations of the rotation curves of low-surface-brightness galaxy ( lsb galaxies ) in the 1990s and of their position on the tullyâ€“fisher relation showed that lsb galaxies had to have dark matter haloes that are more extended and less dense than those of hsb galaxies and thus surface brightness is related to the halo properties . a model of galaxy based on a general relativity metric was also proposed , showing that the rotation curves for the milky way , ngc 3031 , ngc 3198 and ngc 7331 are consistent with the mass density distributions of the visible matter , avoiding the need for a massive halo of exotic dark matter
