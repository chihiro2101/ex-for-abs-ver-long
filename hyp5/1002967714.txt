ibm 701 competed with remington rand 's univac 1103 in the scientific computation market , which had been developed for the nsa , so it was held secret until permission to market it was obtained in 1951 based on the trials , the two machines had comparable computational speed , with a slight advantage for ibm 's machine , but the univac was favored unanimously for its significantly faster input-output equipment palmer , ibm 's 360 and early 370 systems , mit press , 1991 , pp 23-34 at the lawrence livermore national laboratory , an ibm 701 meant that scientists could run nuclear explosives computations faster the first 701 was delivered to ibm 's world headquarters in new york was describing the market acceptance of the ibm 701 computer aviation week for 11 may 1953 says the 701 rental charge was about 12,000 a month ; american aviation 9 nov 1953 says '' 15,000 a month per 40-hour shift on january 7 , 1954 , the team developed an experimental software program that allowed the ibm 701 computer to translate from russian to english the ibm 701 can claim to be the first computer displaying the potential of artificial intelligence in arthur samuel 's checkers-playing program on february 24 , 1956 the program , which was developed for play on the ibm 701 , was demonstrated to the public on television it is still considered a milestone for artificial intelligence and it offered the public during the early 1960s an example of the capabilities of an electronic computer the lawrence livermore national laboratory developed a language compilation and runtime system called the kompiler for their ibm 701 speedcode was the first high-level programming language created for an ibm computer the fortran compiler also developed by backus was not released by ibm until the ibm 704 ibm 700/7000 series list of ibm products list of vacuum tube computers share ( computing ) strela computer , comparable soviet design amdahl discusses his role in the design of several computers for ibm including the ibm 701 , the ibm 704 and the stretch
