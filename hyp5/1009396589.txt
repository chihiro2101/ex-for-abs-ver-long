philosophically , '' individuation '' expresses the general idea of how a thing is identified as an individual thing that '' is not something else '' this includes how an individual person is held to be different from other elements in the world and how a person is distinct from other persons by the seventeenth century , philosophers began to associate the question of individuation or what brings about individuality at any one time with the question of identity or what constitutes sameness at different points in time in analytical psychology , individuation is the process where the individual self develops out of an undifferentiated unconscious – seen as a developmental psychic process during which innate elements of personality , the components of the immature psyche , and the experiences of the person 's life become , if the process is more or less successful , integrated over time into a well-functioning whole communications theorist marshall mcluhan alluded to this trend when discussing the future of printed books in an electronically interconnected world most data protection and privacy laws turn on the identifiability of an individual as the threshold criterion for when data subjects will need legal protection doing so enables the person , at an individual level , to be tracked , profiled , targeted , contacted , or subject to a decision or action which impacts them - even if their ‘ identity ’ is not known ( or knowable ) , as in schrödinger 's cat being simultaneously dead and alive , is mathematically not the same as assuming the cat is in an individual alive state with 50 % probability '' in general , it is the process by which individual beings are formed and differentiated from other human beings ; in particular , it is the development of the psychological individual as a being distinct from the general , collective psychology individuation is a process of transformation whereby the personal and collective unconscious are brought into consciousness ( e.g in l'individuation psychique et collective , gilbert simondon developed a theory of individual and collective individuation in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation rather than a cause the i is essentially a process , not a state , and this process is an in-dividuation — it is a process of psychic individuation these retentional apparatuses arise from a technical system which is the condition of the encounter of the i and the we — the individuation of the i and the we is in this respect also the individuation of the technical system and these retentional apparatuses are the basis for the dispositions between the individuation of the i and the individuation of the we in a single process of psychic , collective , and technical individuation composed of three branches , each branching out into process groups
