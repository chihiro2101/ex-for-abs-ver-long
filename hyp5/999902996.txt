critical chain project management is based on methods and algorithms derived from theory of constraints with traditional project management methods , 30 % of lost time and resources are typically consumed by wasteful techniques such as bad multitasking ( in particular task switching ) , student syndrome , parkinson 's law , in-box delays , and lack of prioritization harvey maylor , project management in a project plan , the critical chain is the sequence of both precedence- and resource-dependent tasks that prevents a project from being completed in a shorter time , given finite resources if resources are always available in unlimited quantities , then a project 's critical chain is identical to its critical path method lack of search for an optimum solution—a '' good enough '' solution is enough because : as far as is known , there is no analytical method for finding an absolute optimum ( i.e critical chain project management uses buffer management instead of earned value management to assess the performance of a project some project managers feel that the earned value management technique is misleading , because it does not distinguish progress on the project constraint ( i.e the longest sequence of resource-leveled tasks that lead from beginning to end of the project is then identified as the critical chain the '' extra '' duration of each task on the critical chain—the difference between the '' safe '' durations and the 50 % durations—is gathered in a buffer at the end of the project in the same way , buffers are gathered at the end of each sequence of tasks that feed into the critical chain each element on the project is encouraged to move as quickly as they can : when they are running their '' leg '' of the project , they should be focused on completing the assigned task as quickly as possible , with minimization of distractions and multitasking because task duration has been planned at the 50 % probability duration , there is pressure on resources to complete critical chain tasks as quickly as possible , overcoming student 's syndrome and parkinson 's law
