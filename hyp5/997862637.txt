radio clocks synchronized to a terrestrial time signal can usually achieve an accuracy within a hundredth of a second relative to the time standard , generally limited by uncertainties and variability in radio propagation some timekeepers , particularly watches such as some casio wave ceptors which are more likely than desk clocks to be used when travelling , can synchronise to any one of several different time signals transmitted in different regions radio clocks depend on coded time signals from radio stations list of radio time signal stations bipm annual report on time activities – ftp : //ftp2.bipm.org/pub/tai/scale/timesignals/timesignals.pdf time signals , retrieved 2018 july 31 a number of manufacturers and retailers sell radio clocks that receive coded time signals from a radio station , which , in turn , derives the time from a true atomic clock one of the first radio clocks was offered by heathkit in late 1983 their model gc-1000 '' most accurate clock '' received shortwave time signals from radio station wwv in fort collins , colorado it kept time during periods of poor reception with a quartz-crystal oscillator this oscillator was disciplined , meaning that the microprocessor-based clock used the highly accurate time signal received from wwv to trim the crystal oscillator radio controlled clock £19.95 clocks may have other features such as indoor thermometers and weather station functionality ; vhf fm radio data system : rds can send a clock signal with sub-second precision but with an accuracy no greater than 100 ms and with no indication of clock stratum many modern radio clocks use the global positioning system to provide more accurate time than can be obtained from terrestrial radio stations casio wave ceptor clock network speaking clock time from npl time transfer time synchronization in north america
