Indigo Girls

recording and touring . early years . amy ray and emily saliers first met and got to know each other as students at dekalb county school district in dekalb county , georgia , just outside decatur , georgia , but were not close friends because saliers was a grade older than ray . while attending shamrock high school ( now druid hills middle school ) , they became better acquainted , and started performing together , first as '' the b-band '' and then as '' saliers and ray '' . saliers graduated and began attending tulane university in louisiana . a year later , ray graduated high school and began attending vanderbilt university in tennessee . homesick , both returned to georgia and transferred to emory university in atlanta ( where saliers ' father was a professor ) . by 1985 , they had begun performing together again , this time as indigo girls . saliers stated in a march 2007 national public radio talk of the nation interview , '' we needed a name and we went through the dictionary looking for words that struck us and indigo was one . '' their first release in 1985 was a seven-inch single named '' crazy game '' , with the b-side '' everybody 's waiting ( for someone to come home ) '' . that same year , the indigo girls released a six-track extended play album named indigo girls , and in 1987 released their first full-length album , strange fire , recorded at john keane studio in athens , georgia , and including '' crazy game '' . with this release , they secured the services of russell carter , who remains their manager to the present ; they had first approached him when the ep album was released , but he told them their songs were '' immature '' and they were not likely to get a record deal . strange fire apparently changed his opinion . . epic records ( 1988–2006 ) . the success of 10,000 maniacs , tracy chapman , and suzanne vega encouraged epic records to enlist other folk-based female singer-songwriters ; epic signed the duo in 1988 . their first major-label release , also named indigo girls , which scored no . 22 on the album chart , included a new version of '' land of canaan '' , which was also on their 1985 ep album and on strange fire . also on the self-titled release was their first hit '' closer to fine '' ( a collaboration with irish band hothouse flowers ) , which scored no . 52 on the popular music chart and no . 26 on the modern rock chart . they even managed one week on the mainstream rock album-oriented rock music chart at no . 48 . in 1990 , they won a grammy award for best contemporary folk album . they were also nominated for best new artist ( but lost to milli vanilli who eventually had their award revoked ) . their second album , nomads indians saints , went gold in december 1991 and included the hit song '' hammer and a nail '' , a no . 12 modern rock music track ; it was not as successful as their first , which was certified platinum at about the same time . the indigo girls followed it with the live back on the bus , y'all and 1992 's album rites of passage , featuring the song '' galileo '' , the duo 's first top 10 modern rock music track ( 10 ) . during the accompanying tour in december , they invited on a few dates siouxsie sioux of siouxsie and the banshees as special guest to sing a couple of songs with them . zarker , karen .

'' thom jurek from allmusic wrote : '' part of an emotional journey as complete as can be . more relevant than anyone dared expect . it 's accessible and moving and true . it 's their own brand of rock & roll , hewn from over the years , that bears a signature that is now indelible . a moving , and utterly poetic offering .
