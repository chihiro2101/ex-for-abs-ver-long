Relevance logic

history . relevance logic was proposed in 1928 by russian soviet philosopher ivan e . orlov ( 1886 – circa 1936 ) in his strictly mathematical paper '' the logic of compatibility of propositions '' published in matematicheskii sbornik . the basic idea of relevant implication appears in medieval logic , and some pioneering work was done by ackermann , moh , moh shaw-kwei , 1950 , '' , '' methodos 2 56–75 . and church in kontroliertes denken : untersuchungen zum logikkalkül und zur logik der einzelwissenschaften , kommissions-verlag karl alber , edited by a . menne , a . wilhelmy and h . angsil , pp . 22–37 . in the 1950s . drawing on them , nuel belnap and alan ross anderson ( with others ) wrote the magnum opus of the subject , entailment : the logic of relevance and necessity in the 1970s ( the second volume being published in the nineties ) . they focused on both systems of entailment and systems of relevance , where implications of the former kinds are supposed to be both relevant and necessary . axioms . the early developments in relevance logic focused on the stronger systems . the development of the routley–meyer semantics brought out a range of weaker logics . the weakest of these logics is the relevance logic b . it is axiomatized with the following axioms and rules . a\to a a\land b\to a a\land b\to b ( a\to b ) \land ( a\to c ) \to ( a\to b\land c ) a\to a\lor b b\to a\lor b ( a\to c ) \land ( b\to c ) \to ( a\lor b\to c ) a\land ( b\lor c ) \to ( a\land b ) \lor ( a\land c ) \lnot\lnot a\to a the rules are the following . a , a\to b\vdash b a , b\vdash a\land b a\to b\vdash ( c\to a ) \to ( c\to b ) a\to b\vdash ( b\to c ) \to ( a\to c ) a\to b\vdash \lnot b\to\lnot a stronger logics can be obtained by adding any of the following axioms . ( a\to b ) \to ( \lnot b\to\lnot a ) ( a\to b ) \land ( b\to c ) \to ( a\to c ) ( a\to b ) \to ( ( b\to c ) \to ( a\to c ) ) ( a\to b ) \to ( ( c\to a ) \to ( c\to b ) ) ( a\to ( a\to b ) ) \to ( a\to b ) ( a\land ( a\to b ) ) \to b ( a\to\lnot a ) \to\lnot a ( a\to ( b\to c ) ) \to ( b\to ( a\to c ) ) a\to ( ( a\to b ) \to b ) ( ( a\to a ) \to b ) \to b a\lor\lnot a a\to ( a\to a ) there are some notable logics stronger than b that can be obtained by adding axioms to b as follows . for dw , add axiom 1 . for dj , add axioms 1 , 2 . for tw , add axioms 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . for rw , add axioms 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 8 , 9 . for t , add axioms 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 11 . for r , add axioms 1-11 . for e , add axioms 1-7 , 10 , 11 , ( ( a\to a ) \land ( b\to b ) \to c ) \to c , and \box a\land \box b\to \box ( a\land b ) , where \box a is defined as ( a\to a ) \to a . for rm , add all the additional axioms . models . routley–meyer models . the standard model theory for relevance logics is the routley-meyer ternary-relational semantics developed by richard sylvan and robert meyer . a routley–meyer frame f for a propositional language is a quadruple ( w , r , ,0 ) , where w is a non-empty set , r is a ternary relation on w , and is a function from w to w , and 0\in w . a routley-meyer model m is a routley-meyer frame f together with a valuation , \vdash , that assigns a truth value to each atomic proposition relative to each point a\in w . there are some conditions placed on routley-meyer frames . define a\leq b as r0ab . a\leq a . if a\leq b and b\leq c , then a\leq c . if d\leq a and rabc , then rdbc . a^ . algebraic models . some relevance logics can be given algebraic models , such as the logic r . the algebraic structures for r are de morgan algebra , which are sextuples ( d , \land , \lor , \lnot , \circ , e ) where ( d , \land , \lor , \lnot ) is a distributive lattice with a unary operation , \lnot obeying the laws \lnot\lnot x x and if x\leq y then \lnot y\leq \lnot x ; e\in d , the binary operation \circ is commutative ( x\circ y y\circ x ) and associative ( ( x\circ y ) \circ z x\circ ( y\circ z ) ) , and e\circ x x , i.e . ( d , \circ , e ) is an abelian monoid with identity e ; the monoid is lattice-ordered and satisfies x\circ ( y\lor z ) ( x\circ y ) \lor ( x\circ z ) ; x\leq x\circ x ; and if x\circ y\leq z , then x\circ\lnot z\leq \lnot y . the operation x\to y interpreting the conditional of r is defined as \lnot ( x\circ\lnot y ) . a de morgan monoid is a residuated lattice , obeying the following residuation condition . : x \circ y\leq z \iff x\leq y\to z an interpretation v is a homomorphism from the propositional language to a de morgan monoid m such that v ( p ) \in d for all atomic propositions , v ( \lnot a ) \lnot v ( a ) v ( a\lor b ) v ( a ) \lor v ( b ) v ( a\land b ) v ( a ) \land v ( b ) v ( a\to b ) v ( a ) \to v ( b ) given a de morgan monoid m and an interpretation v , one can say that formula a holds on v just in case e\leq v ( a ) . a formula a is valid just in case it holds on all interpretations on all de morgan monoids . the logic r is sound and complete for de morgan monoids . see also . non sequitur ( logic ) relevant type system , a substructural type system . references . . bibliography . alan ross anderson and nuel belnap , 1975 . entailment : the logic of relevance and necessity , vol . i . princeton university press . -- -- -- - and j . m . dunn , 1992 . entailment : the logic of relevance and necessity , vol . ii , princeton university press . mares , edwin , and meyer , r . k . , 2001 , '' relevant logics '' , in goble , lou , ed . , the blackwell guide to philosophical logic . blackwell . richard routley , val plumwood , robert k . meyer , and ross t . brady . relevant logics and their rivals . ridgeview , 1982 . r . brady ( ed . ) , relevant logics and their rivals ( volume ii ) , aldershot : ashgate , 2003 . alasdair urquhart . the semantics of entailment . phd thesis , university of pittsburgh , 1972 . katalin bimbó , relevance logics , in philosophy of logic , d . jacquette ( ed . ) , ( volume 5 of handbook of the philosophy of science , d . gabbay , p . thagard , j . woods ( eds . ) ) , elsevier ( north-holland ) , 2006 , pp . & nbsp ; 723–789 . j . michael dunn and greg restall . relevance logic . in handbook of philosophical logic , volume 6 , f . guenthner and d . gabbay ( eds . ) , dordrecht : kluwer , 2002 , pp . & nbsp ; 1–136 . stephen read , relevant logic , oxford : blackwell , 1988 . . external links . stanford encyclopaedia of philosophy : '' relevance logic '' – by edwin mares .
