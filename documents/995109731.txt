Royal Philharmonic Orchestra

history . origins . in 1932 the conductor thomas beecham had founded the london philharmonic orchestra ( lpo ) , which , with the backing of rich supporters , he ran until 1940 , when finances dried up in wartime . beecham left to conduct in australia and then the us ; the orchestra continued without him after reorganising itself as a self-governing body . on beecham 's return to england in september 1944 the lpo welcomed him back and , in october , they gave a concert together that drew superlatives from the critics . william glock , '' music '' , the observer 8 october 1944 , p . 2 ; and '' sir t . beecham 's return '' , the times , 9 october 1944 , p . 8 over the next months beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success , but the lpo players , now their own employers , declined to give him the unfettered control he had exercised in the 1930s . if he were to become chief conductor again it would be as a paid employee of the orchestra . reid ( 1961 ) , p . 230 beecham responded , '' i emphatically refuse to be wagged by any orchestra . i am going to found one more great orchestra to round off my career . '' reid ( 1961 ) , p . 231 in 1945 he conducted the first concert of walter legge 's new philharmonia orchestra , but was not disposed to accept a salaried position from legge , his former assistant , any more than from his former players in the lpo . his new orchestra to rival the philharmonia would , he told legge , be launched in '' the most auspicious circumstances and éclat '' . osborne , p . 248 in 1946 beecham reached an agreement with the royal philharmonic society : his orchestra would replace the lpo at all the society 's concerts . he thus gained the right to name the new ensemble the '' royal philharmonic orchestra '' , an arrangement approved by george vi . '' orchestra refuse to drop 'royal ' from title , the times , 19 august 1964 , p . 10 beecham arranged with the glyndebourne festival that the rpo should be the resident orchestra at glyndebourne seasons . he secured backing , including that of record companies in the us as well as britain , with whom lucrative recording contracts were negotiated . the music critic lyndon jenkins writes : . beecham 's orchestra . beecham appointed victor olof as his orchestral manager , and they started recruiting . at the top of their list were leading musicians with whom beecham had worked before the war . four had been founder members of the lpo fifteen years previously : reginald kell ( clarinet ) , gerald jackson ( flute ) , james bradshaw ( timpani ) and jack silvester ( double-bass ) . from the current lpo they engaged the oboist peter newbury . beecham persuaded the veteran bassoonist archie camden , who had been pursuing a solo career , to return to orchestral work . the cellos were led by raymond clark , enlisted from the bbc symphony orchestra . the principal horn player was dennis brain , who already held the same post in legge 's philharmonia , but managed to play for both orchestras . jenkins speculates that as beecham knew all britain 's orchestral leaders at first hand he decided not to try to lure any of them away . his choice was john pennington , who had been first violin of the london string quartet from 1927 to 1934 , and had then had a career in the us as concertmaster , successively , of the san francisco symphony , los angeles philharmonic and paramount pictures orchestras . jenkins ( 2005 ) , pp . 99–100 lucas , p . 317 on 11 september 1946 , the royal philharmonic assembled for its first rehearsal . four days later it gave its first concert , at the davis theatre , croydon . '' sir thomas beecham 's new orchestra '' , the times , 12 september 1946 , p . 6 beecham telegraphed a colleague , '' press virtually unanimous in praise of orchestra . first croydon concert huge success '' . cardus et al , p 4 beecham and the orchestra played a series of out-of-town engagements before venturing a first london concert on 26 october . the times then spoke of '' a hall filled with golden tone which enveloped the listener '' . '' delius festival '' , the times , 28 october 1946 , p . 6 before its london debut the orchestra made its first recording and , within two years , had made more than 100 . within a few months , pennington was forced to resign when the british musicians ' union discovered that he was not one of its members . lucas , p . 319 he was succeeded by his deputy oscar lampe , '' a man who eschewed most social graces but played the violin divinely '' , according to jenkins . jenkins ( 2005 ) , p . 100 in the early days , the orchestra comprised 72 players , all on yearly contract to beecham , giving him first call on their services , subject to reasonable notice , but not otherwise restricting their freedom to play for other ensembles . potts , p . 8 a review of the london orchestral scene of the late 1940s said of the rpo and its main rival : '' the philharmonia and royal philharmonic share a very serious disability : that neither is a permanently constituted orchestra . both assemble and disperse more or less at random & nbsp ; . there is no style which is distinctively rpo or philharmonia . '' hill , p . 214 brain continued to play first horn for both orchestras ; otherwise , from the early 1950s , there was generally more stability of orchestral personnel . in particular , the rpo became celebrated for its regular team of woodwind principals , in which jackson was joined by jack brymer ( clarinet ) , gwydion brooke ( bassoon ) and terence macdonagh ( oboe ) . jenkins ( 2000 ) , p . 5 the independent described them as '' arguably the finest ever wind section . they became known as 'the royal family ' . '' melville-mason , graham . '' gwydion brooke – bassoonist in sir thomas beecham 's 'royal family ' '' , the independent , 5 april 2005 the rpo toured the united states in 1950 , the first british orchestra to visit america since the london symphony orchestra ( lso ) in 1912 . this was a long-cherished plan of beecham 's , who had been unable to take the lpo to the us in the 1930s . he arranged 52 concerts in 45 cities in 64 days . the tour was described by brain 's biographers gamble and lynch as a huge success . it began on 13 october in hartford , connecticut and finished on 15 december in bethlehem , pennsylvania . the concerto soloists were the pianist betty humby beecham ( the conductor 's second wife ) and orchestral principals : david mccallum ( violin ) , anthony pini ( cello ) and the four members of the '' royal family '' . gamble and lynch , p . 60 in the new york times , olin downes wrote of '' magnificent music-making by sir thomas beecham and the royal philharmonic '' . downes , olin . '' beecham superb in concert here ; conducts royal philharmonic in stirring concert '' , the new york times , 14 december 1950 , p . 50 the following year , assessing all the london orchestras , frank howes , music critic of the times , concluded that the rpo '' comes nearest in quality and in consistency of style to the great international orchestras '' . howes , frank .

'' promenade concert – sir thomas beecham 's début '' , the times , 6 september 1954 , p . 9 in 1957 , beecham and the rpo made a european tour , beginning at the salle pleyel in paris and ending at the musikverein in vienna . lucas , pp . 331–332 beecham conducted the rpo in his last concert , given at portsmouth guildhall on 7 may 1960 . the programme , all characteristic choices , comprised the magic flute overture , haydn 's military symphony , beecham 's own handel arrangement love in bath , schubert 's fifth symphony , on the river by delius , and the bacchanale from saint-saëns 's samson and delilah , with delius 's sleigh ride as an encore . lucas , p . 338 beecham suffered a heart attack the following month , from which he did not recover ; he died in march 1961 . lucas , p . 339 . 1961–2000 . rudolf kempe , who had been appointed associate conductor in 1960 , became principal conductor in 1961 and music director in 1962 .

'' orchestra wins royal fight '' , the times , 16 july 1966 , p . 12 the rpo celebrated its silver jubilee in 1971 . on 15 september , the orchestra returned to croydon , where it had made its debut 25 years earlier . the theatre in which it had first played had been demolished and the anniversary concert was therefore given at the fairfield halls . the programme consisted of the overture to the marriage of figaro , beethoven 's emperor concerto , and holst 's the planets . adrian boult conducted , and clifford curzon was the soloist . cardus et al , pp . 12–13 five members of the original orchestra were still in the rpo for the jubilee concert : leonard brain ( brother of dennis ) , principal cor anglais ; lewis pocock , co-principal timpani ; ernest ineson , double bass ; john myers , viola ; and albert pievsky , violin . the rpo gave kempe the title of '' conductor for life '' in 1970 ; he stepped down from the orchestra in 1975 , the year before his death . he was succeeded as chief conductor by antal doráti , who held the post from 1975 to 1978 ; as in his earlier spells with the lso and bbc symphony orchestra , he was not greatly liked by his players , but raised their standard of playing and imposed discipline . '' great orchestra 's predicament '' , the times , 28 june 1963 , p . 18 ; and '' antal dorati '' , the times , 16 november 1988 , p . 18 in 1984 there was a new threat to the orchestra : a review carried out on behalf of the arts council by the journalist william rees-mogg opined that england lacked '' a great eastern symphony orchestra '' : the suggestion was that the rpo should move to nottingham . another arts council report of the same period recommended that the rpo should supplement the lso as resident orchestra at the barbican centre ; neither proposal came to fruition . morrison , p 152 during the 1980s , the british government imposed strict constraints on public spending ; to make up for lost revenue , the rpo , in common with the other self-governing london orchestras , was forced into increased reliance on business sponsorship as a primary source of funds . the grove dictionary of music and musicians , recording this , comments , '' such sponsorship is , however , subject to changing circumstances and thus less secure in the long term .
