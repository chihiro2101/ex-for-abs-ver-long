however , secondary pathogenic bacteria can occur from scratching of the skin . they are much broader in comparison to head and body lice . adults are found only on the human host and require human blood to survive . if adults are forced off the host , they will die within 24–48 hours without a blood feeding . symptoms of a crab louse infection in the pubic area is intense itching , redness and inflammation . these symptoms cause increased circulation to the skin of the pubic region creating a blood-rich environment for the crab louse . pubic lice infestation can also be diagnosed by identifying the presence of nits or eggs on the pubic hair . in december 2016 npr reported that '' frequent removal of pubic hair is associated with an increased risk for herpes , syphilis and human papillomavirus '' . however , the medical community has also seen a recent increase in folliculitis , or infection around the hair follicle , in women who wax or shave their bikini areas . some of these infections can develop into more serious abscesses that require incision with a scalpel , drainage of the abscess , and antibiotics . staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of folliculitis . burns can result when depilatory wax is used , even according to manufacturer instructions . . grooming . pubic hair grooming has been associated with injury and infection . it is estimated that about 1/4 groomers have had at least one lifetime injury due to pubic hair grooming . grooming has also been associated with cutaneous sexually transmitted diseases , such as genital warts , syphilis , and herpes . . society and culture . according to john ruskin 's biographer mary lutyens , the notable author , artist , and art critic was apparently accustomed only to the hairless nudes portrayed unrealistically in art , never having seen a naked woman before his wedding night . he was allegedly so shocked by his discovery of his wife effie 's pubic hair that he rejected her , and the marriage was later legally annulled . he is supposed to have thought his wife was freakish and deformed . saltz , jerry . pudenda agenda . artnet.com . later writers have often followed lutyens and repeated this version of events . for example , gene weingarten in his book i 'm with stupid ( 2004 ) writes that '' ruskin had the marriage annulled because he was horrified to behold upon his bride a thatch of hair , rough and wild , similar to a man 's . he thought her a monster . '' however , there is no proof for this , and some disagree . peter fuller in his book theoria : art and the absence of grace writes , '' it has been said that he was frightened on the wedding night by the sight of his wife 's pubic hair ; more probably , he was perturbed by her menstrual blood . '' ruskin 's biographers tim hilton and john batchelor also believe that menstruation is the more likely explanation . at puberty , many girls find the sudden sprouting of pubic hair disturbing , and sometimes as unclean , because in many cases young girls have been screened by their family and by society from the sight of pubic hair . young boys , on the other hand , tend not to be similarly disturbed by the development of their pubic hair , usually having seen body hair on their fathers . a united states study by alfred kinsey found that 75 % of the participants stated that there was never nudity in the home when they were growing up , 5 % of the participants said that there was '' seldom '' nudity in the home , 3 % said '' often '' , and 17 % said that it was '' usual '' . the study found that there was no significant difference between what was reported by men and by women with respect to frequency of nudity in the home . in a 1995 review of the literature , paul okami concluded that there was no reliable evidence linking exposure to parental nudity to any negative effect . three years later , his team finished an 18-year longitudinal study that showed that , if anything , such exposure was associated with slight beneficial effects , particularly for boys . with the reintroduction of public beaches and pools bathing in western europe and the mediterranean early in the 20th century , exposure of both sexes ' areas near their pubic hair became more common , and after the progressive reduction in the size of female and male swimsuits , especially since the coming into fashion and growth in popularity of the bikini after the 1940s , the practice of shaving or bikini waxing of pubic hair off the hem lines also came into vogue . grooming . in some middle eastern societies , removal of male and female body hair has been considered proper hygiene , mandated by local customs , for many centuries . muslim teaching includes islamic hygienical jurisprudence in which pubic and armpit hair must be pulled out or shaven to be considered as sunnah . trimming is taught to be considered acceptable . according to feminist writer caitlin moran , the reason for the removal of pubic hair from women in pornography was a matter of '' technical considerations of cinematography '' . hair removal progressed to full removal . because of the popularity of pornography , pubic hair shaving was mimicked by women . the presentation is regarded by some as being erotic and aesthetic , while others consider the style as unnatural . some people remove pubic hairs for erotic and sexual reasons or because they or their sex partner enjoy the feel of a hairless crotch . the hair down there . university of california , santa barbara 's sexinfo . retrieved may 4 , 2007 . flaccid penis with pubic hair trimmed.jpg male genitalia with trimmed pubic hair pubic hair partly shaved genitalia.jpg male genitalia with partly shaved pubic hair young indian man penis.jpg fully shaved male genitalia . methods . all hair can be removed with wax formulated for that purpose . some individuals may remove part or all of their pubic hair , axillary hair and facial hair . pubic hair removal using wax is bikini waxing . the method of removing hair is called depilation ( when removing only the hair above the skin ) or epilation ( when removing the entire hair ) . beauty salons often offer various waxing services . it is sometimes referred to as '' pubic topiary '' . some women modify their pubic hair , either to fit in with societal trends or as an expression of their own style or lifestyle . styles of pubic hair modification include : triangle or american wax ( pubic hair is shortened from the sides to form a triangle so that pubic hair is hidden while wearing swimsuit . the triangle can range from the very edge of the '' bikini line '' to up to an inch reduction on either side . remaining hair length can be from an inch and a half to half an inch ) ; landing strip/french wax ( pubic hair removed except for a strip of hair extending from the abdomen to the vulva ) ; partial brazilian wax ( pubic hair fully removed except for a small triangular strip ) ; full brazilian wax or '' sphinx '' ( complete removal of pubic hair ) ; and freestyle . there are variations of the brazilian wax in which a design is formed out of the pubic hair . stencils for several shapes are available commercially . a controversial gucci commercial included female pubic hair shaved into a ' g' . file : vulva 1a.png natural or '' au naturel '' —no trimming and therefore no maintenance . file : vulva 1b.png triangle/american wax—hair shortened from the sides to form a triangle so that pubic hair is hidden while wearing swimsuit . file : female pubis with hair.jpg triangle/american wax '' —hair shortened from the sides to form a triangle so that pubic hair is hidden while wearing swimsuit . file : landing_strip_pubic_hair_pattern_lq.jpg landing strip/french wax—waxing with a '' landing strip '' or '' metro ticket '' . file : pubic hair ( brazilian haircut ) triangle style.jpg partial '' brazilian wax '' with a small triangular strip left file : female abdomen frontal view.jpg '' brazilian wax '' or '' sphinx '' —a full waxing ;

'' in another part of his autobiography walter remarks that he has seen those '' bare of hair , those with but hairy stubble , those with bushes six inches long , covering them from bum bone to navel . '' and he adds reflectively – '' there is not much that i have not seen , felt or tried , with respect to this supreme female article . '' in like vein , in the memoirs of dolly morton , an american erotic classic , the attributes of miss dean are noted with some surprise – her spot was covered with a '' thick forest of glossy dark brown hair , '' with locks nearly two inches long . one man remarked , '' but gosh ! i 've never seen such a fleece between a woman 's legs in my life . darn me if she would n't have to be sheared before man could get into her .
