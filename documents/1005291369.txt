The 13th Floor Elevators

history . formation . the 13th floor elevators emerged on the local austin music scene in december 1965 , where they were contemporary to bands such as the wig and the babycakes and later followed by shiva 's headband and the conqueroo . the band formed when roky erickson left his group the spades , and joined up with stacy sutherland , benny thurman , and john ike walton who had been playing texas coastal towns as the lingsmen . tommy hall was instrumental in bringing the band members together , and joined the group as lyricist and electric jug player . the band 's name developed from a suggestion by drummer john ike walton to use the name '' elevators '' . clementine hall added '' 13th floor '' . in addition to an awareness that a number of tall buildings in the us lack a designated 13th floor , it was noted that the letter '' m '' ( for marijuana ) is the thirteenth letter of the alphabet . . 1966-1967 : psychedelic sounds and easter everywhere . in early january 1966 , producer gordon bynum brought the band to houston to record two songs to release as a single on his newly formed contact record label . the songs were erickson 's '' you 're gon na miss me '' , and hall-sutherland 's '' tried to hide '' . some months later , the international artists label picked it up and re-released it . throughout the spring of 1966 , the group toured extensively in texas , playing clubs in austin , dallas , and houston . they also played on live teen dance shows on tv , such as sumpin else , in dallas , and the larry kane show in houston . during the summer , the ia re-release of '' you 're gon na miss me '' became popular outside texas , especially in miami , detroit , and the san francisco bay area . in october 1966 , it peaked on the national billboard chart at the no . & nbsp ; 55 position . prompted by the success of the single , the elevators toured the west coast , made two nationally televised appearances for dick clark , and played several dates at the san francisco ballrooms the fillmore and the avalon . the international artists record label in houston , also home to contemporary texas underground groups such as red krayola and bubble puppy , signed the elevators to a record contract and released the album the psychedelic sounds of the 13th floor elevators in november 1966 , which became popular among the burgeoning counterculture . tommy hall 's sleeve-notes for the album , which advocated chemical agents ( such as lsd ) as a gateway to a higher , 'non-aristotelian ' state of consciousness , has also contributed to the album 's cult status . during their california tour , the band shared bills with quicksilver messenger service , the great society ( featuring grace slick ) , and moby grape . on returning to texas in early 1967 , they released a second single , '' levitation '' , and continued to play live in austin , houston and other texas cities . in november 1967 , the band released a second album , easter everywhere . the album featured a cover of bob dylan 's '' it 's all over now , baby blue '' . however , shortly before work began on easter everywhere , walton and leatherman left the band and were replaced by danny thomas on drums and dan galindo on bass , because of disputes over mismanagement of the band 's career by international artists and a fundamental disagreement between walton and hall over the latter 's advocacy of the use of lsd in the pursuit of achieving a higher state of human consciousness . as a result , they were not credited in the easter everywhere sleevenotes , despite having appeared on '' ( i 've got ) levitation '' and '' she lives ( in a time of her own ) '' . despite the lengthy studio work and resources utilized , easter everywhere was not the success the band and international artists had hoped for . lacking a hit single and released too late in the year , it sold out its original run , but was never reprinted , suggesting somewhat disappointing sales . record label paperwork indicate that the band 's debut album sold upwards of 40,000 copies during its original run , while easter everywhere may have sold around 10,000 copies . at one point around 1967 , erickson was a roommate of future cult musician townes van zandt . erickson insisted that he join the elevators on bass , even though he was a guitarist who had never played bass before . he auditioned for hall , but hall rejected him . . 1968-69 : bull of the woods and breakup . while the band were unable to repeat their national success , they were still a powerful presence on the texas rock music scene . chris gerniottis , ex-lead singer of zakary thaks has spoken repeatedly of how the elevators stood apart from all the other bands on the regional scene , and they continued to influence these bands during the late 1960s . following the local popularity of the track '' slip inside this house '' , an edited version was released as a single in early 1968 and was played frequently on houston radio . meanwhile , the elevators had lost their bass player dan galindo , who went on to another international artists band , the rubiayat . duke davis briefly replaced galindo , before the band 's earlier bassist ronnie leatherman returned in the summer of 1968 . as documented in a lengthy interview and article in the texas underground music magazine mother no . & nbsp ; 3 , the band worked all spring of 1968 on their new album , which at one point was to be called beauty and the beast . however , because of an unstable member line-up and the increasingly erratic behavior of the psychedelicized tommy hall and mentally fragile roky erickson , little of value came out of these sessions . the live shows had lost their original energy , and often the band would perform without their lead singer erickson , due to his recurring hospital treatments at the time . the last concert featuring the '' real '' elevators occurred in april 1968 . international artists put out a live lp in august 1968 , which was composed of old demo tapes and outtakes dating back to 1966 for the most part , with fake applause and audience noise added . around this time , the original 13th floor elevators disbanded , as the nucleus of erickson-hall-sutherland had been reduced to guitarist stacy sutherland only . sutherland brought some of his own songs for a final set of studio sessions , which led to the dark , intense posthumous album bull of the woods . initially disliked by many elevators fans , it has found a substantial fan-base today , with some even rating it the band 's best lp . these final sessions consisted of sutherland on guitar , ronnie leatherman on bass , and danny thomas on drums . bull of the woods was largely the work of stacy sutherland . erickson , due to health and legal problems , and tommy hall were only involved with a few tracks , including '' livin ' on '' , '' never another '' , '' dear doctor doom '' , and '' may the circle remain unbroken '' . a few live gigs were played around texas during the second half of 1968 , until an article in rolling stone magazine in december 1968 declared the band gone . international artists pulled together the various studio recordings from 1968 and , with the assistance of drummer danny thomas , added some horn arrangements , which became the bull of the woods album , released in march 1969 . the final 13th floor elevators record released by international artists was a reissue of the '' you 're gon na miss me '' single in mid-1969 . singer janis joplin was a close associate of clementine hall and the band . she opened for the band at a benefit concert in austin , and considered joining the group prior to heading to san francisco and joining big brother and the holding company . drug overuse and related legal problems left the band in a state of constant turmoil , which took its toll , both physically and mentally , on the members . in 1969 , facing a felony marijuana possession charge , roky erickson chose to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital rather than serve a prison term , thus signaling the end of the band 's career . . music . during the initial months of their existence as a band , the electric guitars used both by roky erickson and stacy sutherland were gibson es-330s . sutherland 's pioneering use of reverb and echo , and bluesy , acid-drenched guitar predates such bands as zz top , butthole surfers , and the black angels . according to billy gibbons of zz top , in the documentary you 're gon na miss me , the guitars were run through fender fender twin blackface , fender reverb units ( referred to as a '' tube reverb '' or '' reverb tank '' ) , and gibson maestro fz-1 fuzz-tones . a special aspect of the elevators ' sound came from tommy hall 's innovative electric jug . the jug , a crock-jug with a microphone held up to it while it was being blown , sounded somewhat like a cross between a minimoog and cuica drum . in contrast to traditional musical jug technique , hall did not blow into the jug to produce a tuba-like sound . instead , he vocalized musical runs into the mouth of the jug , using the jug to create echo and distortion of his voice . when playing live , he held the microphone up to the mouth of the jug , but when recording the easter everywhere album , the recording engineer placed a microphone inside the jug to enhance the sound . at tommy hall 's urging , the band often played their live shows and recorded their albums while under the influence of lsd , and built their lifestyle and music around the psychedelic experience . intellectual and esoteric influences helped shape their work , which shows traces of gurdjieff , the general semantics of alfred korzybski , the psychedelic philosophy of timothy leary , and tantric meditation . members . the original 13th floor elevators line-up was built around singer/guitarist roky erickson , electric jug player tommy hall , and guitarist stacy sutherland . the rhythm section went through several changes , with drummer john ike walton and bass player ronnie leatherman being replaced in july 1967 . walton and leatherman left the band ; in their stead were new recruits danny thomas ( drums , piano ) and dan galindo ( bass ) which completed the classic elevators line-up . hall remained the band 's primary lyricist and philosopher , with sutherland and erickson both contributing lyrics as well as writing music , and , later , working with danny thomas to arrange the group 's more challenging music . in addition to erickson 's powerful vocals , hall 's '' electric jug '' became the band 's signature sound . later , ronnie leatherman returned for the third and final studio album , bull of the woods along with thomas , and sutherland . roky erickson – guitar ,
