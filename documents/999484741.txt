Alan Sillitoe

biography . sillitoe was born in nottingham to working-class parents , christopher sillitoe and sabina ( née burton ) . like arthur seaton , the anti-hero of his first novel , saturday night and sunday morning , his father worked at the raleigh bicycle company 's factory in the town . his father was illiterate , violent , and unsteady with his jobs , and the family was often on the brink of starvation . sillitoe left school at the age of 14 , having failed the entrance examination to grammar school . he worked at the raleigh factory for the next four years , spending his free time reading prodigiously and being a '' serial lover of local girls '' . he joined the air training corps in 1942 , then the royal air force , albeit too late to serve in the second world war . he served as a wireless operator in malaya during the emergency . after returning to britain he was planning to enlist in the royal canadian air force when it was discovered that he had tuberculosis . he spent 16 months in an raf hospital . pensioned off at the age of 21 on 45 shillings ( £2.25 ) a week , he lived in france and spain for seven years in an attempt to recover . in 1955 , while living in mallorca with the american poet ruth fainlight , whom he married in 1959 , and in contact with the poet robert graves , sillitoe started work on saturday night and sunday morning , which was published in 1958 . influenced in part by the stripped-down prose of ernest hemingway , the book conveys the attitudes and situation of a young factory worker faced with the inevitable end of his youthful philandering . as with john osborne 's look back in anger and john braine 's room at the top , the novel 's real subject was the disillusionment of post-war britain and the lack of opportunities for the working class . it was adapted as a film by karel reisz in 1960 , with albert finney as arthur seaton ; the screenplay was written by sillitoe . sillitoe 's story the loneliness of the long distance runner , which concerns the rebellion of a borstal boy with a talent for running , won the hawthornden prize in 1959 . it was also adapted into a film , in 1962 , directed by tony richardson and starring tom courtenay . sillitoe again wrote the screenplay . with fainlight he had a child , david . they later adopted another , susan . sillitoe lived at various times in kent , london and montpellier . in london he was friendly with the bookseller bernard stone ( who had been born in nottingham a few years before sillitoe ) and became one of the bohemian crowd that congregated at stone 's turret bookshop on kensington . in the 1960s sillitoe was celebrated in the soviet union as a spokesman for the '' oppressed worker '' in the west . invited to tour the country , he visited several times in the 1960s and in 1968 he was asked to address the congress of soviet writers ' unions , where he denounced soviet human rights abuses , many of which he had witnessed . in 1990 sillitoe was awarded an honorary degree by nottingham polytechnic , now nottingham trent university . the city 's older russell group university , the university of nottingham , also awarded him an honorary d.litt . in 1994 . in 2006 his best-known play was staged at the university 's lakeside arts theatre in an in-house production . sillitoe wrote many novels and several volumes of poems . his autobiography , life without armour , which was critically acclaimed on publication in 1995 , offers a view of his squalid childhood . in an interview sillitoe claimed that '' a writer , if he manages to earn a living at what he 's doing , even if it 's a very poor living , acquires some of the attributes of the old-fashioned gentleman ( if i can be so silly ) .
