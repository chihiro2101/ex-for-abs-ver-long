Apelles

biography . probably born at colophon in ionia , he first studied under ephorus of ephesus , but after he had attained some celebrity he became a student to pamphilus at sicyon pliny the elder , natural history 35 . ( 36 ) 75 . he thus combined the dorian thoroughness with the ionic grace . attracted to the court of philip ii , he painted him and the young alexander napoleon doubted that alexander ever literally sat for apelles : '' certes , alexandre n ' a jamais posé devant apelles '' . he was probably right , given that the sculptor lysippus was alexander 's court portraitist with such success that he became the recognized court painter of macedon , and his picture of alexander holding a thunderbolt ranked in the minds of many with the alexander with the spear of the sculptor lysippus . hundreds of years later , plutarch was among the unimpressed , deciding that it had failed to accurately reproduce alexander 's colouring : '' he made alexander 's complexion appear too dark-skinned and swarthy , whereas we are told that he was fair-skinned , with a ruddy tinge that showed itself especially upon his face and chest . '' plutarch , alexander , 4.3 image : aphrodite anadyomene from pompeii cropped.jpg thumb 300px this mural from pompeii is believed to be based on apelles ' venus anadyomene , brought to rome by augustus . much of what is known of apelles is derived from pliny the elder ( natural history , xxxv ) . his skill at drawing the human face is the focus of a story connecting him with ptolemy i soter . this onetime general of alexander disliked apelles while they both were in alexander 's retinue . many years later , while travelling by sea , a storm forced apelles to land in ptolemy 's egyptian kingdom . ptolemy 's jester was suborned by apelles ' rivals to convey to the artist a spurious invitation to dine with ptolemy . apelles ' unexpected arrival enraged the king . ptolemy demanded to know who had given apelles the invitation , and with a piece of charcoal from the fireplace apelles drew a likeness on the wall , which ptolemy recognized as his jester in the first strokes of the sketch . pliny the elder , natural history , xxxv.89 apelles was a contemporary of protogenes , whose reputation he advocated . pliny also recorded an anecdote that was making the rounds among hellenistic connoisseurs of the first century ce : apelles travelled to protogenes ' home in rhodes to make the acquaintance of this painter he had heard so much about . arriving at protogenes ' studio , he encountered an old woman who told him that protogenes was out and asked for his name so she could report who had enquired after him . observing in the studio a panel protogenes had prepared for a painting , apelles walked over to the easel , and taking up a brush told the servant to tell protogenes '' this came from me , '' and drew in colour an extremely fine line across the panel . when protogenes returned , and the old woman explained what had taken place , he examined the line and pronounced that only apelles could have done so perfect a piece of work ; protogenes then dipped a brush into another colour and drew a still finer line above the first one , and asked his servant to show this to the visitor should he return . when apelles returned , and was shown protogenes ' response , ashamed that he might be bettered , he drew in a third colour an even finer line between the first two , leaving no room for another display of craftsmanship . on seeing this , protogenes admitted defeat , and went out to seek apelles and meet him face-to-face . guillaume apollinaire retold this story in his essay '' on the subject of modern painting '' , originally published in les soirées de paris , february 1912 . this tale is a literary trope epitomizing the sublime simplicity of the greatest art in the hands of a consummate artist : comparable examples are giotto 's perfect circle , drawn freehand , and the scholar-painter chuang-tzu 's perfect crab , which , following ten years of preparation , was drawn in a single stroke without lifting his ink brush from the paper . pliny claims that this very painting had been part of the collection of julius caesar , but was destroyed when caesar 's mansion on the palatine hill burned down . while sketching one of alexander the great 's concubines , campaspe , apelles fell in love with her . as a mark of appreciation for the great painter 's work , alexander presented her to him . apelles is said to have been working on a painting of aphrodite of kos when he died , and the painting was left unfinished for no one could be found with skill enough to complete it . the renowned work of apelles provided several exemplars for the narrative realism admired by greco-roman connoisseurs , succinctly expressed in horace 's words ut pictura poesis , '' as is painting so is poetry . '' apelles seemed to have had a taste for elaborate allegory and personification , which he carried far in his rendering of calumny , described by lucian , leonard whibley , a companion to greek studies 3rd ed . 1916 , p . 329 . in which an innocent youth is falsely accused by ignorance , envy , treachery and deceit . the story occasioning the painting was alleged to have been false accusations by a rival artist that apelles took part in a conspiracy against ptolemy iv philopator . this almost led to the artist 's execution . '' in the renaissance the exemplar of the poetic painting which was invariably cited whenever the art-poetry question was discussed was the calumny of apelles , known through lucian 's description .

'' another refers to his practice of exhibiting his works in the front of his shop , then hiding nearby to hear the comments of passers-by . when a cobbler commented on his mistakes in painting a shoe , apelles made the corrections that very night ; the next morning the cobbler noticed the changes , and proud of his effect on the artist 's work began to criticize how apelles portrayed the leg—whereupon apelles emerged from his hiding-place to state : ne sutor ultra crepidam— '' let the shoemaker venture no further than the shoe . '' christiane j . hessler , ne supra crepidam sutor , fifteenth century studies , 33 ( 2008 ) , 133-150 . the last saying pliny attributes to apelles refers to the painter 's diligence at practising his art every day : nulla dies sine linea— '' not a day without a line drawn . '' apelles was also reportedly j n hallock . 1892 . the christian life . new york asked why he touched and retouched his paintings so continually , trying to achieve perfection ( at least in his own mind ) ; to which he replied , '' i paint for eternity . '' pliny states that apelles made a number of useful innovations to the art of painting , but his recipe for a black varnish , called by pliny atramentum—which served both to preserve his paintings and to soften their colour , and created an effect that pliny praises to no end—apelles kept secret and was lost with his death . there can be little doubt that apelles was one of the most bold and progressive of artists . such was his fame that several italian renaissance painters repeated his subjects , in a vain hope of giving some notion of the composition of them . raphael may have portrayed himself as apelles in the school of athens and sandro botticelli based two paintings—the birth of venus and calumny of apelles—on his works . references and sources . references . . sources . pliny the elder , historia naturalis xxxv , 91 ff . woltmann and woermann , history of painting , volume i ( english translation , new york , 1886 ) houssaye , histoire d'apelles ( paris , 1867 ) wustmann , apelles ' leben und werke ( leipzig , 1870 ) ernst h . gombrich , 'the heritage of apelles ' , the heritage of apelles : studies in the art of renaissance , ( cornell university press : ithaca , new york , 1976 ) , pp 3–18 . john j . popovic , '' apelles , the greatest painter of antiquity '' source quotes from pliny 's natural history .
