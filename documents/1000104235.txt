Fokker Scourge

background . early air warfare . as aerial warfare developed , the allies gained a lead over the germans by introducing machine-gun armed types such as the vickers f.b.5 gunbus fighter and the morane-saulnier l . cheesman 1960 , p . 177 . bruce 1989 , pp . 2–4 . by early 1915 , the german ( ohl , supreme army command ) had ordered the development of machine-gun-armed aircraft to counter those of the allies . the new '' c '' class , armed two-seaters and twin-engined '' k '' ( later '' g '' ) class aircraft such as the aeg g.i were attached in ones and twos to ( ffa ) artillery-observation and reconnaissance detachments for '' fighter '' sorties , mostly the escort of unarmed aircraft . van wyngarden 2006 , p . 18 . jones , 2002 , p . 469 on 18 april 1915 , the morane-saulnier l of roland garros was captured , after he was forced to land behind the german lines . bruce 1989 , p . 3 . from 1april , garros had destroyed three german aircraft in the morane , which carried a machine-gun firing through the propeller arc . saulnier had failed to develop a synchroniser and with garros , as an interim solution , fitted metal wedges to the propeller ; bullets that hit the blades were deflected by them . cheesman 1960 , p . 178 . garros burned his aircraft but this failed to conceal the nature of the device and the significance of the deflector blades . the german authorities requested several aircraft manufacturers , including that of anthony fokker , to produce a copy . . synchronisation gear . the fokker company produced the ( push rod controller ) , a genuine synchronisation gear . impulses from a cam driven by the engine controlled the timing of the machine-gun for its fire to be limited to the intervals between the propeller blades 's travel past the barrel . grosz 1989 , p . 2 . unlike earlier proposed gears the was fitted to an aircraft and proved in flight . in a postwar biography , fokker claimed that he produced the gear in 48hours but it was probably designed by heinrich lübbe , a engineer . weyl 1965 , p . 96 . among several pre-war patents for similar devices was that of franz schneider , a swiss engineer who had worked for nieuport and the german lvg company . woodman 1989 , pp . 180–183 . the device was fitted to the most suitable fokker type , the fokker m.5k ( military type name '' fokker a.iii '' ) , of which a.16/15 , assigned to otto parschau , became the prototype of the fokker eindecker series of fighter designs . gray and thetford 1961 , p . 83 . fokker demonstrated a.16/15 to german fighter pilots , including kurt wintgens , oswald boelcke and max immelmann in may and june 1915 . van wyngarden 2006 , p . 9 . the fokker , with its typical controls , an over-sensitive balanced elevator and dubious lateral control , was difficult to fly ; parschau , who was experienced on fokkera types , converted pilots to the new fighter . immelmann 2009 , p . 77 . van wyngarden 2006 , p . 10 . the early were attached to ffas , in ones and twos , to protect reconnaissance machines from allied machine-gun-armed aircraft . . operational service . service début . fokker e.5/15 , the last of the pre-production series , is believed to have been first flown in action by kurt wintgens of ffa6 . van wyngarden 2006 , pp . 11–12 . on 1and 4july 1915 , he reported combats with french morane-saulnierl ( parasols ) , well over the french lines . the claims were not confirmed but research has shown that the first claim matches french records of a morane forced down on 1july near lunéville , with a wounded crew and a damaged engine , followed three days later by another . van wyngarden 2006 , pp . 10–12 . by 15july , wintgens had moved to ffa48 and scored his first confirmed victory , another moranel . franks 2001 , pp . 10–11 . parschau had received the new e.1/15 ( fokker factory serial 191 ) , the initial example of the five fokker m.5k/mg service test examples for the line of aircraft , when the a.16/15 ( green machine ) , he had flown since the beginning of the war , was returned to the fokker flugzeugbau factory in schwerin–gorries for development . van wyngarden 2006 , p . 12 . by the end of july 1915 , about fifteen were operational with various units , including the five m.5k/mgs and about ten early production e.i airframes . the pilots flew the new aircraft as a sideline , when not flying normal operations in two-seater reconnaissance aircraft . boelcke , in ffa62 , scored his first victory in an albatros c.i on 4july . van wyngarden 2006 , p . 13 . m.5k/mg prototype airframe e.3/15 , the first delivered to ffa62 , was armed with a parabellum mg14 gun , synchronised by the unreliable first version of the fokker gear . at first , e.3/15 was jointly allocated to him and immelmann when their '' official '' duties permitted , allowing them to master the type 's difficult handling characteristics and to practice shooting at ground targets . van wyngarden 2006 , p . 14 . immelmann was soon allocated a very early production fokker e.i , e.13/15 , one of the first armed with the lmg 08 ( a lightened version of the mg08 spandau ) machine-gun , using the more reliable production version of the fokker gear . woodman 1989 , pp . 180–183 . . the scourge begins . the fokker scourge is usually considered by the british to have begun on 1august , when b.e.2cs of 2 squadron royal flying corps ( rfc ) bombed the base of ffa62 at waking the german pilots , including boelcke ( most likely , still with e 3/15 ) and immelmann ( flying e 13/15 ) , who were quickly into the air after the raiders . boelcke suffered a jammed gun but immelmann caught up with a b.e.2c and shot it down . this aircraft was flown as a bomber , without an observer or lewis gun , the pilot armed only with an automatic pistol . after about ten minutes of manoeuvring ( giving the lie to exaggerated accounts of the stability of b.e.2 aircraft ) immelmann had fired 450rounds , which riddled the b.e . and wounded the pilot in the arm . van wyngarden 2006 , p . 15 . by late october , towards the end of the battle of loos , more fokkers ( including the similar pfalz e-type fighters , which were also called fokkers by allied airmen ) were encountered by rfc pilots and by december , forty fokkers were in service . franks 2001 , p . 59 . jones , 2002 , p . 144 wise , 1981 , p . 355 in the new fighters , pilots could make long , steep dives , aiming the fixed , synchronised machine-gun by aiming the aircraft . the machine gun was belt-fed , unlike the drum-fed lewis guns of their opponents , who had to change drums when in action . the fokker pilots took to flying high and diving on their quarry , usually out of the sun , firing a long burst and continuing the dive until well out of range . if the british aircraft had not been shot down , the german pilot could climb again and repeat the process . immelmann invented the immelmann turn , a zoom after the dive , followed by a roll when vertical to face the opposite way , after which he could turn to attack again . jones , 2002 , p . 150 the mystique acquired by the fokker was greater than its material effect and in october , rfc hq expressed concern at the willingness of pilots to avoid combat . rfc losses were exacerbated by the increase in the number of aircraft at the front , from 85 to 161 between march and september , the hard winter of 1915–1916 and some aggressive flying by the new german '' c '' type two-seaters . wise , 1981 , p . 355 hoeppner 1994 , p . 38 boelcke and immelmann continued to score , as did hans joachim buddecke , ernst von althaus and rudolph berthold from ffa23 and kurt voncrailshein of ffa53 . the '' official '' list of claims by fokker pilots for the second half of 1915 was no more than 28 , many of them over french aircraft . thirteen aeroplanes had been shot down by immelmann or boelcke and the rest by seven other fokker pilots . franks 2001 , p . 41 . january 1916 brought thirteen claims , most of them against the french , followed by twenty more in february , the last month of the '' scourge '' proper . most of the victories had been scored by aces rather than the newer pilots flying the greater number of fokkers . allied casualties had been light by later standards but the loss of air superiority to the germans , flying a new and supposedly invincible aircraft , caused dismay among the allied commanders and lowered the morale of allied airmen . in his memoir sagittarius rising ( 1936 ) , cecil lewis wrote , on 14 january , rfc hq issued orders that until better aircraft arrived , long and short-range reconnaissance aircraft must have three escorts flying in close formation . if contact with the escorts was lost , the reconnaissance must be cancelled , as would photographic reconnaissance to any great distance beyond the front line . sending the b.e.2c into action without an observer armed with a lewis gun also became less prevalent . terraine 1982 , p . 199 . the new tactic of concentrating aircraft in time and space had the effect of reducing the number of reconnaissance sorties the rfc could fly . jones , 2002 , pp . 156–157 new defensive formations were devised ; a ii wing rfc method was for the reconnaissance aircraft to lead , escorted on each side higher , with another escort behind and above . jones , 2002 , pp . 147–148 on 7 february , on a iiwing long-range reconnaissance , the observation pilot flew at ; a german aircraft appeared over roulers and seven more closed in behind the formation . west of thourout , two fokkers arrived and attacked at once , one diving on the reconnaissance machine and the other on an escort . six more german aircraft appeared over kortemark and formed a procession of fourteen aeroplanes stalking the british formation . none of the german pilots attacked and all the british aircraft returned , only to meet two german aircraft coming back from a bombing raid , which opened fire and mortally wounded the pilot of one the escorts . the british ascribed their immunity to attack during the 55-minute flight to the rigid formation which the two fokkers were unable to disrupt . jones , 2002 , pp . 157–158 on 7 february , a 12 squadron b.e.2c . , was to be escorted by three b.e.2cs , two f.e.2s and a bristol scout from 12 squadron and two more f.es . and four r.e . aeroplanes from 21 squadron . the flight was cancelled due to bad weather but twelve escorts for one reconnaissance aircraft demonstrated the effect of the fokkers in reducing the efficiency of rfc operations . jones , 2002 , p . 158 british and french reconnaissance flights to get aerial photography for intelligence and ranging data for their artillery had become riskier , in spite of german fighters being forbidden to fly over allied lines ( to keep the synchronisation gear secret ) . franks 2001 , pp . 11–12 . this policy , for various reasons , prevailed for most of the war ; the rarity of german fighters appearing behind the allied lines limited the degree of air superiority they were able to attain . hoeppner , 1994 , p . 41 franks 2001 , p . 6 . . end of the scourge . the beginning of the end of the scourge came at the battle of verdun ( 21february20december 1916 ) . an attempt to impose an air barrage had largely concealed the german preparations for the offensive from french aerial reconnaissance . during march and april increasing numbers of the new french nieuport 11 fighters were sent to verdun . organised in specialist fighter squadrons the nieuports could operate in formations larger than the singletons or pairs normally flown by the fokkers , quickly regaining air superiority for the herris and pearson 2010 , p . 29 . british f.e.2b pusher aircraft had been arriving in france from late 1915 and in the new year began to replace the older f.b.5s . the pilot and observer had a good view forwards from their cockpits and the observer could also fire backwards over the tail . 20 squadron , the first squadron equipped with the f.e . , arrived in france on 23january 1916 , for long-range reconnaissance and escort flying . fokker pilots attacked the f.e.s without hesitation but soon found that the new aircraft could be formidable opponents , particularly when flying in formation but the f.e . lacked sufficient speed and manoeuvrability to pursue and attack the fokkers . hare 1990 , p . 87 . the airco dh.2 single-seat fighter , began to arrive at the front in february 1916 . this aircraft had a modest performance but its superior manoeuvrability gave it an advantage over the , especially once a clamp , fixing the lewis gun pointing straight ahead , was installed . on 8 february , 24 squadron ( major lanoe hawker ) arrived with d.h.2s and began patrols north of the somme ; another six d.h.2 squadrons followed . on 25 april , two of the d.h . pilots were attacked and found that they could out-manoeuvre the fokkers ; a few days later , without opening fire , a d.h . pilot caused a fokker to crash onto a roof at bapaume . jones , 2002 , pp . 158–159 the nieuports proved even more effective when the first nieuport 16s in british service were issued to 1 and 11 squadrons in april . cheesman 1960 , p . 92 . by march 1916 , despite frequent encounters with fokkers and the success of aces , the scourge was over . franks 2001 , pp . 59–60 . the bogey of the fokker as a fighter was finally laid in april , when an e.iii landed by mistake on a british aerodrome . the captured aircraft was found not to have the superior performance it had been credited with . lewis , 1977 , p . 52 the first british aircraft with a synchronisation gear was a bristol scout , which arrived on 25 march 1916 and on 24 may the first sopwith 1½ strutter aircraft were flown to france by a flight of 70 squadron . bruce , 1968 , v.2 , p.119 . end of the . the effect of the new allied types , especially the nieuport , was of considerable concern to the fokker pilots ; some even took to flying captured examples . van wyngarden 2006 , p . 51 . was sufficiently desperate to order german firms to build nieuport copies , of which the euler d.i and the siemens-schuckert d.i were built in quantity . van wyngarden 2006 , p . 64 . cheesman 1960 , p . 166 . new d type single-seat , biplane fighters , particularly the fokker d.ii and halberstadt d.ii , had been under test since late 1915 and the replacement of the monoplanes with these types began by mid-1916 . grosz 1996 , p . 5 . in february 1916 , friedrich stempel began to assemble ( kek , single-seat battle units ) . the kek were units mostly of two to four fighters , equipped with and other types which had served with ffa units during the winter of 1915–1916 . by july 1916 , kek had been formed at vaux , avillers , jametz and cunel near verdun as well as other places on the western front , as ( aerial guard service ) units , consisting only of fighters . guttman , 2009 , p . 9 in late may , german air activity on the british front decreased markedly , while the commander of the new , ( colonel ) hermann von der lieth-thomsen , reorganised the german air service . gray & thetford 1962 p . xxix the fighters of the kek were concentrated into fighter squadrons the first of which , jagdstaffel 2 went into action on the somme on 17 september . by this time , the last of the , long outmoded as front line fighters , had been retired . jones , 2002 , p . 281 . aftermath . analysis . among british politicians and journalists who grossly exaggerated the material effects of the '' scourge '' were the eminent pioneering aviation journalist c.g . grey , founder of the aeroplane , one of the first aviation magazines and noel pemberton billing , a royal naval air service ( rnas ) pilot , notably unsuccessful aircraft designer and manufacturer and a member of parliament from march 1916 . their supposed object was the replacement of the b.e.2c with better aircraft but it took the form of an attack on the rfc command and the royal aircraft factory . c.g . grey had orchestrated a campaign against the royal aircraft factory in the pages of the aeroplane , going back to its period as the balloon factory , well before it had produced any heavier-than-air aircraft . hare 1990 , p . 29 before the unsuitability of the b.e.2c for aerial combat was exposed by the first fokker aces , criticism was not primarily aimed at the technical quality of royal aircraft factory aircraft but because a government body was competing with private industry . when the news of the fokker monoplane fighters reached him in late 1915 , grey was quick to blame the problem on orders for equipment that the latest developments had rendered obsolete . grey did not suggest alternative aircraft , even supposing that the rapid development of aviation technology during the war could have been foreseen . pemberton billing also blamed the initially poor performance of british aircraft manufacturers on what he saw as the favouritism shown by the rfc , an arm of the british army , towards the royal aircraft factory , which , while nominally civilian , was also part of the army . pemberton billing claimed that , even among writers who recognised the hysteria of this version of events , this picture of the fokker scourge gained considerable currency during the war and afterwards . in 1996 peter grosz wrote , . subsequent operations . the period of allied air superiority that followed the fokker scourge was brief ; by mid-september 1916 , the first twin-spandau armed albatros d.i fighters were coming into service . the new aircraft were again able to challenge allied aircraft , culminating in '' bloody april '' during the battle of arras cheesman 1960 , p . 108 . in the next two years , the allied air forces gradually overwhelmed the in quality and quantity , until the germans were only able to gain temporary control over small areas of the western front . when this tactic became untenable , development of new aircraft began , which led to the fokker d.vii . the new aircraft created another fokker scourge in the summer of 1918 and as a condition of the armistice , germany was required to surrender all of its fokker d.viis to the allies .
