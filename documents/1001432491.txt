Micrometeoroid

origins and orbits . micrometeoroids are very small pieces of rock or metal broken off from larger chunks of rock and debris often dating back to the birth of the solar system . micrometeoroids are extremely common in space . tiny particles are a major contributor to space weathering processes . when they hit the surface of the moon , or any airless body ( mercury , the asteroids , etc . ) , the resulting melting and vaporization causes darkening and other optical changes in the regolith . micrometeoroids have less stable orbits than meteoroids , due to their greater surface area to mass ratio . micrometeoroids that fall to earth can provide information on millimeter scale heating events in the solar nebula . meteorites and micrometeorites ( as they are known upon arrival at the earth 's surface ) can only be collected in areas where there is no terrestrial sedimentation , typically polar regions . ice is collected and then melted and filtered so the micrometeorites can be extracted under a microscope . sufficiently small micrometeoroids avoid significant heating on entry into the earth 's atmosphere . p . fraundorf ( 1980 ) the distribution of temperature maxima for micrometeorites decelerated in the earth 's atmosphere without melting geophys . res . lett . 10:765-768 . collection of such particles by high flying aircraft began in the 1970s , d . e . brownlee , d . a . tomandl and e . olszewski ( 1977 ) interplanetary dust : a new source of extraterrestrial material for laboratory studies , proc . lunar sci . conf . 8th:149-160 . since which time these samples of stratosphere-collected interplanetary dust ( called brownlee particles before their extraterrestrial origin was confirmed ) have become an important component of the extraterrestrial materials available for study in laboratories on earth . historical studies . in 1946 during the giacobinids , helmut landsberg collected several small magnetic particles that were apparently associated with the shower . fred whipple , '' the theory of micro-meteorites , part i : in an isothermal atmosphere '' , proceedings of the national academy of sciences , volume 36 number 12 ( 15 december 1950 ) , pp . 667 – 695 . fred whipple was intrigued by this and wrote a paper that demonstrated that particles of this size were too small to maintain their velocity when they encountered the upper atmosphere . instead , they quickly decelerated and then fell to earth unmelted . in order to classify these sorts of objects , he coined the term '' micrometeorite '' . fred whipple , '' the theory of micrometeorites . '' , popular astronomy , volume 57 , 1949 , p . 517 . . velocities . whipple , in collaboration with fletcher watson of the harvard observatory , led an effort to build an observatory to directly measure the velocity of the meteors that could be seen . at the time the source of the micro-meteorites was not known . direct measurements at the new observatory were used to locate the source of the meteors , demonstrating that the bulk of material was left over from comet tails , and that none of it could be shown to have an extra-solar origin . today it is understood that meteoroids of all sorts are leftover material from the formation of the solar system , consisting of particles from the interplanetary dust cloud or other objects made up from this material , like comets . . flux . the early studies were based exclusively on optical measurements . in 1957 , hans pettersson conducted one of the first direct measurements of the fall of space dust on the earth , estimating it to be 14,300,000 tons per year . hans pettersson , '' cosmic spherules and meteoritic dust . '' scientific american , volume 202 issue 2 ( february 1960 ) , pp . 123–132 . this suggested that the meteoroid flux in space was much higher than the number based on telescope observations . such a high flux presented a very serious risk to the high-orbiting apollo capsules and for missions to the moon . to determine whether the direct measurement was accurate , a number of additional studies followed , including the pegasus satellite program , lunar orbiter 1 , luna 3 , mars 1 and pioneer 5 . these showed that the rate of meteors passing into the atmosphere , or flux , was in line with the optical measurements , at around 10,000 to 20,000 tons per year . andrew snelling and david rush , '' moon dust and the age of the solar system '' creation ex-nihilo technical journal , volume 7 number 1 ( 1993 ) , p . 2–42 . these showed that the flux was much lower than earlier estimates , around 10,000 to 20,000 tons per year . the surveyor program determined that the surface of the moon is relatively rocky . snelling , andrew and david rush .

( accelerating objects up to such velocities is difficult ; current techniques include linear motors and shaped charges . ) the risk is especially high for objects in space for long periods of time , such as satellites . they also pose major engineering challenges in theoretical low-cost lift systems such as rotovators , space elevators , and orbital airships . swan , p . , penny , r . swan , c . space elevator survivability , space debris mitigation , lulu.com publishers , 2011 . spacecraft micrometeoroid shielding . whipple 's work pre-dated the space race and it proved useful when space exploration started only a few years later . his studies had demonstrated that the chance of being hit by a meteoroid large enough to destroy a spacecraft was extremely remote . however , a spacecraft would be almost constantly struck by micrometeorites , about the size of dust grains . whipple had already developed a solution to this problem in 1946 . originally known as a '' meteor bumper '' and now termed the whipple shield , this consists of a thin foil film held a short distance away from the spacecraft 's body . when a micrometeoroid strikes the foil , it vaporizes into a plasma that quickly spreads . by the time this plasma crosses the gap between the shield and the spacecraft , it is so diffused that it is unable to penetrate the structural material below . brian marsden , '' professor fred whipple : astronomer who developed the idea that comets are 'dirty snowballs ' . '' the independent , 13 november 2004 . the shield allows a spacecraft body to be built to just the thickness needed for structural integrity , while the foil adds little additional weight . such a spacecraft is lighter than one with panels designed to stop the meteoroids directly . for spacecraft that spend the majority of their time in orbit , some variety of the whipple shield has been almost universal for decades . fred whipple , '' of comets and meteors '' science , volume 289 number 5480 ( 4 august 2000 ) , p . 728 . judith reustle ( curator ) , '' shield development : basic concepts '' , nasa hvit . retrieved 20 july 2011 . later research showed that ceramic fibre woven shields offer better protection to hypervelocity ( ~7 & nbsp ; km/s ) particles than aluminium shields of equal weight . ceramic fabric offers space age protection , 1994 hypervelocity impact symposium another modern design uses multi-layer flexible fabric , as in nasa 's design for its never-flown transhab expandable space habitation module , kim dismukes ( curator ) , '' transhab concept '' , nasa , 27 june 2003 . retrieved 10 june 2007 . and the bigelow expandable activity module , which was launched in april 2016 and attached to the iss for two years of orbital testing . . footnotes . see also . extraterrestrial materials interplanetary dust cloud . external links . melted crumbs from asteroid vesta article about micrometeorites collected in antarctica in planetary science research discoveries educational journal tr : mikrometeor
