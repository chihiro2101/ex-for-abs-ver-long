Fast Forward (TV series)

background . many of the stars came from a 1985 seven network sketch comedy pilot called the eleventh hour , which also spawned the comedy company , via the d-generation . fast forward was commissioned by seven in late 1988 . it was produced by vizard 's production company , united film completion , and broadcast on seven network . there were a number of working titles for the show , including snapped cable television , as well as fast forward . style . fast forward was noted for its fast-paced satirical comedy which particularly lampooned the media , in particular film and tv , with its parodies of well-known television shows ( such as kung fu , lost in space , the munsters , and a current affair ) , personalities ( such as clive james , jana wendt , derryn hinch and geoffrey robertson ) and commercials ( such as for american express and nescafé ) . its subjects were also australian politics , which it attacked through various political impersonations ( including john howard and paul keating ) , and also using the political puppets , rubbery figures , previously seen in small segments on the abc , based on peter nicholson 's political cartoons . another key distinguishing feature was the use of simulated channel surfing to switch from sketch to sketch , often in the middle of a sketch , sometimes after the punchline . particularly a sketch would abruptly switch to a momentary segment of static , followed by another sketch , simulating the effect of the viewer repeatedly switching channels . the channel-surfing device became a distinctive hallmark of the show that helped move quickly from sketch to sketch . the television and multimedia subject matter of the sketches , pace , style and devices were real points of difference from predecessor sketch comedy shows of the time , particularly earlier shows such as the mavis bramston show , the naked vicar show , australia you 're standing in it , the d-generation and the comedy company , fast forward was more media-focused and parody-focused ; a real difference , and the binding force for the whole show , was the now-famous channel-changing device . the white noise and on-screen static that represented the channel change became the modern television equivalent of a curtain being drawn at an old-fashioned vaudeville show . fast forward was also well known for its musical parodies , particularly of current music video clips . some of the better-known music parodies included abba , cher and dannii minogue . sketches and content . each episode of fast forward featured regular characters , a news-based segment , a major parody of a well-known television show or film , lampoons of television commercials , political satire , particularly in a segment using the rubbery figures political puppets . some of the most memorable regular characters included •marg downey : sbs presenter •magda szubanski : pixie-ann wheatley ; chenille the beautician ( with marg downey as janelle ) ; the ugly couple ( with peter moon ) •steve vizard and peter moon : advertising executives , brent smythe and barry ; indian rug fakari salesmen roger ramshet and abdul •michael veitch : gay flight attendants ( with steve vizard ) ; kelvin cunnington ; redmond herring •gerry connolly : the queen ; joh bjelke-petersen •jane turner : russian news presenter sveter ( with peter moon as victor ) •steve vizard : darren hunch ( parody of derryn hinch ) •ernie dingo : robert gottliebsen •steve blackburn and geoff brooks : arthur and wayne dodgy ( dodgy salesmen who previously appeared in australia you 're standing in it ) •michael veitch and glenn robbins : the whizz bang theatre company some of the most memorable sketches included '' dumb street '' , a parody of home and away and neighbours ; and a lampoon of skippy . in one memorable sketch that went to air , moon and vizard were both visibly trying to contain their laughter through a series of insults in one of their parodies of kung fu . fast forward - kung fu parody the political puppets rubbery figures were made more '' commercial '' than on the abc by inserting them into popular situations outside the political canberra environment . this led to the star trek parody where paul keating was mr . spock and bob hawke was captain kirk . rubbery figures was a huge hit and a crucial element in the early success of fast forward . in 1991 , there were five thomas & friends skits featuring ertl thomas models . these segments involved people complaining about sodor not having female steam engines , the fat controller polluting the countryside by pouring purple gunge out of the tankers , drunken punks , the engines going on strike , and the engines getting replaced . in these skits , thomas would do some human things , such as eating breakfast , writing , and going away for the weekend . percy was referred to as bertie two times in the first sketch , gordon at the end of the fourth , and henry one time in the fifth . the sketches had five original engine characters , crazy bartholomew the loco locomotive , who was a thomas model painted yellow , alfred , who was a percy model painted red ( he was even referred to as percy at the start of the fifth sketch ) , damian the diesel , who is n't seen in person , edgar , who is a mentioned engine character , and one of the female engines , who was a percy model painted orange with additional detailing . toby was also mentioned once at the end of the first sketch , and so was clarabel once in the fourth sketch . the full-length tv or movie
