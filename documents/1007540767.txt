Nine Network

history . origins . tcn-9 was launched on 16 september 1956 by the daily telegraph owner frank packer . john godson introduced the station and bruce gyngell presented the first programme , this is television ( so becoming the first person to appear on australian television ) . later that year , gtv-9 in melbourne commenced transmissions to broadcast the 1956 summer olympics , later forming the national television network alongside qtq-9 in brisbane in 1959 and nws-9 in adelaide , the basis of the current nine network , in 1959 . before its formation , tcn-9 was then affiliated with hsv-7 ( because they were both australia 's first television stations , having been opened in 1956 ) , and gtv-9 's sister affiliate was atn-7 . by 1967 , the network had begun calling itself the national nine network , and became simply the nine network australia in 1988 . kerry packer inherited the company after his father 's death in 1974 . before the official conversion to colour on 1 march 1975 , it was the first australian television station to regularly screen programmes in colour with the first program to use it premiering in 1971 , the very year ntd-8 in darwin opened its doors . in 1967 , the new south wales rugby football league grand final became the first football grand final of any code to be televised live in australia . the nine network paid 5,000 for the broadcasting rights . in the late 1980s , stw-9 perth , which opened in 1965 , became a nine network owned-and-operated station when bond media purchased the network . however , in 1989 , bond media sold the perth-based station to sunraysia television for a 95 million , due to the federal cross-media ownership laws which restricted the level of national reach for media owners . in 2011 , gtv 9 melbourne moved from 22 bendigo street , richmond , to 717 bourke street , docklands . 22 bendigo street started out as the wertheim piano factory , then became the heinz soup factory , then gtv9 . the building in bendigo street still stands , now as luxury apartments . 1977–2006 : the golden era . nine began using the slogan '' let us be the one '' ( based on the carpenters song , later used by abc in the united states ) in 1977 and became the number-one free-to-air network in australia ; its national nine news became the most-watched news service . in 1978 , nine switched its slogan to '' still the one '' ( modelled on the campaign used by abc in the united states ) , which lasted until a decline in ratings in january 2006 . during the 1980s , nine 's ratings peaked . from 1999 to 2001 , the network began losing ground to the seven network in news and entertainment , but received a boost after the coverage of the 11 september attacks in 2001 . by 1991 , the network was re-branded to its current branding . the death of ceo kerry packer in 2005 triggered more problems for the network . digital terrestrial television was introduced on 1 january 2001 . 2006–2008 : nine loses to seven . nine stayed strong throughout 2003 & ndash ; 04 , winning 77 out of 80 ratings weeks across those two years ( with network ten claiming the other three weeks ) , but was hit hard when seven introduced a new line-up in 2005 , though nine finished ahead of seven that year . meanwhile , nine news was overtaken by seven news for the first time ever , while today was beaten by seven 's fledgling sunrise program . in 2006 , nine continued on its downward trend , losing most news weeks to seven news and just winning the year thanks to its coverage of the 2006 commonwealth games . to try to revitalise the network in its 50th anniversary , nine adopted a new , but critically received , logo that removed the nine dots , which had been part of the network 's identity since 1970 . in may 2007 , nine partially reintroduced the nine dots , which resulted in the square logo changing into a three-dimensional ( 3d ) cube that rotates , with the dots visible on every second side of the cube . after a period of declining ratings , david gyngell returned to the job of chief executive officer in october 2007 , succeeding eddie mcguire . in 2007 , despite several hits , seven won the whole year by a significant margin . the seven network had won 38 weeks , whereas the nine network only won two . the network expanded into northern nsw with the acquisition on nbn television in may 2007 . however , nbn was retained as an independent nine affiliate following the acquisition . deborah wright who had been doing various roles for the station was promoted to ceo . 2008–2015 : expanding digital services . in 2008 , as part of a major relaunch , the network dropped the blue box , and reinstated its nine dots in its logo , with a 3d look . after losing viewers to seven news , nine relaunched its news service as nine news , which managed to win more weeks over seven in the first half of 2008 . nine also launched a break-out hit , underbelly , which attracted over 2.5 million viewers in its first season . nine tried to attract younger demographics , so while seven went on to win the ratings year in total people , nine was rated the number one network in the key 18–49 and 25–54 demographics . in march 2008 , the nine network launched a high definition channel called 9hd on channel 90 until 2010 . in 2009 , nine started relatively strongly due to the top-rating australian drama underbelly : a tale of two cities and the twenty20 cricket series until nine lost the rights in 2018 , but could not hold its audience after network ten 's masterchef australia became a hit . nine became inconsistent with scheduling and removal of programmes . nine also launched a number of reality shows , including ladette to lady , wipeout australia , homemade , australia 's perfect couple , and the apprentice australia , in the hope of achieving the same success other networks had with the genre . all the new formats underperformed in the ratings and did not help the network establish any stable local content . nine also expanded its news strand with the reintroduction of a late-night bulletin ( for its owned-and-operated stations ) , an extended morning bulletin and weekend editions of today . the flagship 6:00 & nbsp ; pm state bulletins continued to fall in the ratings , though its melbourne bulletin remained competitive , being the only market to win any weeks against seven news . in august 2009 , nine launched its own digital multi-channel called go ! on channel 99 , primarily aimed at a younger demographic . the shares from go ! contributed to nine 's weekly shares and allowed it to enjoy several weeks of weekly ratings wins . in september , the network took on a new slogan , '' welcome home '' , and revamped its graphic package . with the resurgence of nine news , growth of today , stabilisation of 60 minutes and a new programme line-up consisting of hey hey it 's saturday , underbelly and sea patrol , nine enjoyed more ratings success . in 2010 , nine obtained the rights to exclusive coverage of the sydney new year 's eve fireworks . go ! won the year in digital shares only . on 26 september 2010 , nine launched their third digital channel gem ( an acronym of general entertainment and movies ) on channel 90 . in 2011 , the nine network announced a new '' home of comedy '' line-up with comedy shows such as two and a half men , the big bang theory , and other american sitcoms , along with the launch of a live comedy show ben elton live from planet earth , which was cancelled after only three episodes due to low ratings . nine also brought back this is your life with eddie mcguire as host , although the series was cancelled after airing four episodes . the nine network had success in the ratings in the second half of 2011 with the block , underbelly : razor , and the celebrity apprentice australia . the highly anticipated return of a revamped ninth season of two and a half men proved a huge success for the network , generating 2.3 million viewers and dominating the week as top program . 2.3m for two and a half men tv tonight , 21 september 2011 the return of new episodes of the popular sitcom the big bang theory was also a huge success for the network , scoring high figures consistently week after week and dominating the evening as top program . despite this , the nine network finished in second place in the ratings again in 2011 on 19.6 % , behind the seven network ( 23.1 % ) and ahead of the network ten ( 15.9 % ) , abc tv ( 12.2 % ) and sbs ( 4.6 % ) . free to air tv ratings for the year 2011 throng , 26 november 2011 on 24 november 2011 , the nine network announced the line-up for 2012 , with a focus on reality programs , including an australian version of the voice , the return of big brother , excess baggage , and the celebrity apprentice australia . nine 's home of excitement in 2012 . the voice , excess baggage , big brother , more underbelly , celebrity apprentice and the block throng , 24 november 2011 the nine network also aired coverage of the 2012 summer olympics in london . a new morning show , mornings , replaced the departure of kerri-anne kennerley 's self-titled show , after nine years on air . the program , now called today extra , is hosted by sylvia jeffreys and david campbell . on 26 march 2012 , the nine network launched extra , a new channel aimed at delivering home shopping , brand funded , religious , community , educational and multi-cultural programming content created by advertisers . it was reported on 31 may 2012 that the australian telecommunications company telstra and win television network ceo , bruce gordon , are considering making a takeover bid for nine entertainment . telstra eyes troubled nine television network the australian , 31 may 2012 bruce gordon explores possible nine bid business spectator , 13 june 2012 the network currently is trying to fight off administration as it deals with a debt exceeding a 3.3 billion . it was reported on 3 june 2013 that the nine network would immediately purchase adelaide affiliate nws-9 from the win corporation as part of a deal to secure international cricket television rights . on 3 july 2013 , it was reported that nine would exercise an option to also buy stw-9 from win corporation . both purchases have resulted in these stations being , once again , o & o stations of the network for the first time since the 1980s . as of 10 december 2013 , nine no longer broadcasts on analogue tv and is now only available through digital tv or digital set-top box . on 27 january 2014 , the nine network have stopped using the supertext logo and have switched to their own closed captioning logo . 2015–2019 : a new era in television . on 26 november 2015 , nine relaunched 9hd , an hd simulcast of their primary channel , on channel 90 and launched new lifestyle channel 9life on channel 94 . in addition to the relaunch of 9hd , gem ( renamed 9gem ) was reduced to standard definition and moved to channel 92 and go ! ( renamed 9go ! ) was moved to channel 93 . on 16 december 2015 , nine also changed its on-air theme for a continuous design across all of its channels with the nine news/9news.com.au branding to remain unchanged . this included a new look for program listings , program advertisements and promos . additionally in november 2015 , hugh marks replaced david gyngell as ceo . on 27 january 2016 , nine 's online catch-up video on-demand service 9jumpin was retired and replaced by 9now . 9now offers a range of content larger than 9jumpin and also offers a live streaming service for nine 's multicast channels . live streaming for nine was launched on the same day , with streaming for 9gem , 9go ! and 9life launched on 19 may 2016 . following the launch of 9now , the win corporation , owner of nine affiliate win television , filed a lawsuit against nine entertainment co . , claiming that live streaming into regional areas breaches their affiliation agreement . the case was later dismissed on 28 april 2016 with justice hammerschlag of the nsw supreme court stating that , '' i have concluded that live streaming is not broadcasting within the meaning of the psa ( program supply agreement ) , and that nine is under no express or implied obligation not to do it . '' following their victory in the 9now court case , nine entertainment co . announced on 29 april 2016 that it had signed a 500 million five year affiliation deal with southern cross austereo , the then-primary regional affiliate of network 10 . on 1 july 2016 , win television lost its nine affiliate status to southern cross , which had nine 's metropolitan branding introduced across its now nine ( southern cross austereo ) . nine later secured an affiliate deal with mdv ( tv station ) , a joint venture between win and prime media group , on 28 june 2016 to supply nine content to the mildura and sunraysia area due to win switching affiliation to network ten . nine finalised supply deals with win for south australia and griffith on 29 june 2016 after long negotiations , with a deal for tasmanian joint venture tdt secured the following day after long negotiations . a supply deal for western australia joint venture west digital television was not secured before the 1 july 2016

channel on foxtel channel 601 and also available free-to-air through nine on channel 95 , replacing extra . however , it closed on 17 may 2019 due to lack of advertising and poor ratings . in august 2019 , in a huge week for local announcements , disney confirmed its service will arrive in australia in november , apple ramped up its original-content budget to us6 billion ( 8.9 billion ) ahead of launch later this year , nine-owned stan signed a deal with paramount , amazon commissioned its first australian series and seven west media told investors it is keen to get back in the game after earlier misfires . the success of netflix in disrupting the pay-tv world that foxtel ruled down under has now spawned a plethora of on-demand entertainment options , with media companies and viewers scrambling to make the new era work for them . stan is owned by nine , publisher of the australian financial review , and its paramount tv deal , signed earlier in the week , included a number of shows that have been commissioned for disney 's hulu and at & t 's hbo max in the us . nine entertainment ’ s streaming service stan looks like losing out in the battle for movie content dominance . the platform recently inked a deal with paramount pictures to give it extra content in the struggle for market share with netflix . that deal would give stan exclusive rights to some of paramount ’ s best known-films , including mission : impossible , transformers , star trek and top gun . however , the now completed merger between paramount pictures ’ parent company viacom and network giant cbs , which now owns network 10 , has cast doubt on the value of the stan-paramount partnership . on 21 november 2019 , tv tonight reported that kids ' wb had been axed and that production on the series would conclude within two weeks . it was stated that the cancellation of the series was due to the expiry of the nine network 's long-running output deal with warner bros because the studio has so many of warner bros programs in this network and wants to make room for the other programs of nbcuniversal and viacomcbs . the final episode aired on 29 november 2019 , ending the show 's 13-year run . 2019 & ndash ; present : return to the top . after 12 years , the nine network won the 2019 ratings year for the first time since 2006 . the seven network had won every ratings year between 2007 and 2018 inclusive , however , due to lower than expected ratings , and a launch of new programs not performing as hoped , this allowed nine to regain lost ground during the most competitive times of the ratings period ( most notably , nine 's married at first sight performed above expectations , and consistently beat my kitchen rules which saw its lowest figures on record ) which resulted in nine 's first win in the first quarter since 2009 . nine 's yearly share for 2019 concluded at 29.4 % , a 2.1 % increase from 2018 ( 27.3 % ) compared to seven 's 29.0 % , a 1.7 % decline from 2018 ( 30.7 % )

colours for 7 days '' presentation package . on 30 january 2006 , the network and its affiliates relaunched their logos to coincide with nine 's 50th anniversary . a numeral nine was reworked with a few rounded corners eliminated in process . this logo would use a blue square featuring the numeral altered , which saw the removal of the nine dots again . the graphics package used during that time was designed by bruce dunlop associates . later on 15 january 2007 the blue square became solid , and in may they partially relaunched the nine dots , which are visible on every second surface of the
