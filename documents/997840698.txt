Public opinion in the United States on the invasion of Iraq

timeline . march 1992 . in march 1992 , 55 % of americans said they would support sending american troops back to the persian gulf to remove saddam hussein from power . . 2001 . seven months prior to the september 11 attacks a gallup poll showed that 52 % would favor an invasion of iraq while 42 % would oppose it . additionally , 64 % said that the u.s . should have removed saddam at the end of the gulf war . public opinion p . 130 . . post 9/11 sentiment . following the attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 , united states ' popular opinion was seemingly for an invasion of iraq . according to the cnn/usa today/gallup poll , conducted on october 3–6 , 2002 , 53 % of americans said they favor invading iraq with u.s . ground troops in an attempt to remove saddam hussein from power ( saad , lydia ) . as represented in the chart below the american public 's support for the war fluctuated between 50 % and 60 % during the aftermath of attacks 9/11 . when asked whether or not the united states should attack a country that has not attacked the united states first , the american public 's opinion was in support with 51 % , whereas when iraq was embedded into the question the attitude shifted and there was a shift to 66 % of americans agreeing that u.s . should be able to invade iraq first . despite public concern for the consequences of war the public 's support remained very high . original concerns included , 55 percent of americans fearing that the war would last too long , 44 percent taking in consideration a mass number of casualties , 62 percent of the public being convinced that this would increase short-term terrorism domestically , 76 felt there would be a higher risk of domestic bioterrorism , and 35 believed that the draft would need to be reinstated . at the same time 40 percent of the american public was against having protests because they believed it would undermine the success abroad . additionally , 55 percent supported the war even without support from the un . image : no war pdx.jpg thumb right 300px protests in portland , oregon in march 2006 approximately two-thirds of respondents wanted the government to wait for the un inspections to end , and only 31 % supported using military force immediately . this same poll showed that a majority believed that iraq had weapons of mass destruction , but did not expect un inspectors to find them . these numbers indicated a dramatic drop in support , as , two months prior , most polls showed about two-thirds of those polled supporting military action . however , about 60 % of those polled also supported , if necessary , the use of military action to remove hussein from power which closely mirrored recent polls taken by time magazine , cnn , fox news , usa today , cbs news , and other news organizations . polls also showed that most americans did not think that saddam was co-operating with inspectors . polls also suggested that most americans would still like to see more evidence against iraq , and for un weapons inspections to continue before making an invasion . for example , an abc news poll reported that only 10 % of americans favored giving the inspectors less than a few weeks ; 41 % favored giving them a few weeks , 33 % a few months , and 13 % more than that . a consistent pattern in the months leading up to the u.s.-led invasion was that higher percentages of the population supported the impending war in polls that offered only two options ( for or against ) than in polls that broke down support into three or more options given ( distinguishing unconditional support for the war , opposition to the war even if weapons inspectors do their job , and support if and only if inspection crews are allowed time to investigate first ) . some polls also showed that the majority of americans believed that president bush had made his case against iraq . the gallup poll , for example , found that 67 % of those who watched the speech felt that the case had been made , which was a jump from 47 % just prior the speech . however , many more republicans than democrats watched the speech , so this may not be an accurate reflection of the overall opinion of the american public . an abc news poll found little difference in the percentage of americans who felt that george w . bush has made his case for war after he had made his speech , with the percentage remaining at about 40 % . following powell 's february 5 speech at the un , most polls , like one conducted by cnn and nbc , showed increased support for the invasion . tim russert , nbc 's washington bureau chief , said the increases in support were '' largely '' due to president bush 's state of the union speech in january and to powell 's presentation on february 5 , which most viewers felt offered strong evidence for action against iraq . bush 's approval ratings climbed seven points , and support for the invasion increased by four points . only 27 % opposed military action , the smallest percentage since the polls began in april 2002 . the percentage of americans supporting an invasion without un support jumped eight points to 37 % . 49 % of those polled felt that president bush had prepared the country for war and its potential risks , a 9-point jump from the previous month . a gallup poll showed the majority of the population erroneously believed iraq was responsible for the attacks of september 11 . invasion of iraq . although pro-war sentiments were very high after 9/11 , public opinion stabilized soon after , and slightly in favor of the war . according to a gallup poll conducted from august 2002 through early march 2003 , the number of americans who favored the war in iraq fell to between 52 percent to 59 percent , while those who opposed it fluctuated between 35 percent and 43 percent . days before the march 20 invasion , a usa today/cnn/gallup poll found support for the war was related to un approval . nearly six in 10 said they were ready for such an invasion '' in the next week or two . '' but that support dropped off if the u.n . backing was not first obtained . if the united nations security council were to reject a resolution paving the way for military action , 54 % of americans favored a u.s . invasion . and if the bush administration did not seek a final security council vote , support for a war dropped to 47 % . an abc news/washington post poll taken after the beginning of the war showed a 62 % support for the war , lower than the 79 % in favor at the beginning of the persian gulf war . however , when the us invaded iraq in operation iraqi freedom , public support for the conflict rose once again . according to a gallup poll , support for the war was up to 72 percent on march 19 , the day the fighting began . positive opinion on the war was not only present , it was strong . out of the 72 percent who reported supporting the war , 59 percent reported supporting the war strongly , and although allied commanders said they had not yet found evidence of weapons of mass destruction days after the initial invasion , 9 out of 10 americans believed it was '' at least somewhat likely '' that the united states would find evidence of these weapons . president george w . bush 's approval rating also jumped at the beginning of the war , going up 13 percentage points at the start of this conflict ( smith and lindsay ) . . may 2003 . a gallup poll made on behalf of cnn and usa today concluded that 79 % of americans thought the iraq war was justified , with or without conclusive evidence of illegal weapons . 19 % thought weapons were needed to justify the war . . august 2004 . an august 2004 poll showed that two-thirds ( 67 % ) of the american public believe the u.s . went to war based on incorrect assumptions . the morale of the us troops has been subject to variations . issues include the vulnerability of the humvee vehicles , and the great number of wounded and maimed soldiers . september 2004 . a cbs poll showed that 54 % of americans believed the iraq invasion was the right thing to do , up from 45 % in july in the same poll . . november 2004 . in the year leading up to the presidential election in 2004 ( november 3 , 2003 , and october 31 , 2004 ) public opinion began to fluctuate significantly in response to major events in the war , including the capture of saddam hussein capture and the scandal at abu ghraib prison . of the 364 days of news in this year , 348 contained at least one segment that mentioned iraq . the coverage of the war most often provided reasons for support and rationales for the conflict , with themes most often including '' troops '' , '' threat '' , '' freedom '' , '' peace '' , and '' evil '' . cnn reporter howard kurtz reported that the news coverage of the war in the beginning of the topic was too one-sided , writing , '' from august 2002 through the march 19 , 2003 , launch of the war , i found more than 140 front-page stories that focused heavily on administration rhetoric against iraq : 'cheney says iraqi strike is justified ' ; 'war cabinet argues for iraq attack ' . 'bush cites urgent iraqi threat ' ; 'bush tells troops : prepare for war . ' by contrast , pieces questioning the evidence or rationale for war were frequently buried , minimized or spiked . '' this type of coverage quickly changed after the major turning points of the iraq war . once it was discovered that there were no weapons of mass destruction in 2004 , the new york times quickly apologized for its rhetoric , stating that its coverage was '' not as rigorous as it should have been '' and that the times overplayed stories with '' dire claims about iraq '' . george w . bush was re-elected with a 50.74 % majority of the vote in the presidential election of november 2004 . 2003–2004 shift in public support . americans overwhelmingly approved of president bush and his decisions in iraq during the major combat phase of the war . this number of those approving of bush 's dealing with iraq reached 80 % in april 2003 , its highest point in the war . but in the summer of 2003 , after the major combat had ended but u.s . troops continued to take casualties , those numbers began to wane . the period from november 2003 to october 2004 the public opinion on the war varied noticeably . public support went '' from a high of more than 55 % in mid-december immediately after the capture of saddam hussein , to a low of 39 % in mid to late june just before the u.s . transferred power to the newly formed iraqi government .
