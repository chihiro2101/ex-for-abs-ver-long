Abingdon-on-Thames

history . a neolithic stone hand axe was found at abingdon . petrology analysis in 1940 identified the stone as epidote tuff from stake pass in the lake district , to the north . stone axes from the same source have been found at sutton courtenay , alvescot , kencot and minster lovell . abingdon has been occupied from the early to middle iron age and the remains of a late iron age defensive enclosure ( or oppidum ) lies below the town centre . the oppidum was in use throughout the roman occupation . abingdon abbey was founded in saxon times , possibly around ad 676 , but its early history is confused by numerous legends , invented to raise its status and explain the place name . the name seems to mean 'hill of a man named æbba , or a woman named æbbe ' , possibly the saint to whom st ebbe 's church in oxford was dedicated ( æbbe of coldingham or a different æbbe of oxford ) . however , abingdon stands in a valley and not on a hill . it is thought that the name was first given to a place on boars hill above chilswell , and the name was transferred to its present site when the abbey was moved . in 1084 , william the conqueror celebrated easter at the abbey and then left his son , the future henry i , to be educated there . in the 13th and 14th centuries , abingdon was a flourishing agricultural centre with an extensive trade in wool and a famous weaving and clothing manufacturing industry . the abbot seems to have held a market from very early times and charters for the holding of markets and fairs were granted by various sovereigns , from edward i to george ii . in 1337 there was a famous riot in protest at the abbot 's control of this market in which several of the monks were killed . after the abbey 's dissolution in 1538 , the town sank into decay and , in 1556 , upon receiving a representation of its pitiable condition , mary i granted a charter establishing a mayor , two bailiffs , twelve chief burgesses and sixteen secondary burgesses , the mayor to be clerk of the market , coroner and a jp . the present christ 's hospital originally belonged to the guild of the holy cross , on the dissolution of which edward vi founded the almshouses instead , under its present name . the council was empowered to elect one burgess to parliament and this right continued until the redistribution of seats act 1885 . a town clerk and other officers were appointed and the town boundaries described in great detail . later charters , from elizabeth i , james i , james ii , george ii and george iii , made no considerable change . james ii changed the style of the corporation to that of a mayor , twelve alderman and twelve burgesses . in 1790 abingdon lock was built , replacing navigation to the town via the swift ditch . in 1810 , the wilts & berks canal opened , linking abingdon with semington on the kennet and avon canal . abingdon became a key link between major industrial centres such as bristol , london , birmingham and the black country . in 1856 the abingdon railway opened , linking the town with the great western railway at . the wilts & berks canal was abandoned in 1906 but a voluntary trust is now working to restore and re-open it . abingdon railway station was closed to passengers in september 1963 . the line remained open for goods until 1984 , including serving the mg car factory , which opened in 1929 and closed in october 1980 as part of a british leyland rationalisation plan . the nearest railway station is radley , away . abingdon was served by a branch line but the line and abingdon railway station were closed in 1963 . much of the original abingdon branch line is now a cyclepath , whilst the land on which the station stood has been extensively redeveloped , and is now the site of a large waitrose store and surrounded by a large number of new flats and houses . abingdon became the county town of berkshire sometime after receiving its royal charter in 1556 . assize courts were held in abingdon from 1570 , but in the 17th century it was vying with reading for county town status . the county hall and court house were built between 1678 and 1682 , to assert this status . the building , now the abingdon county hall museum , was reputedly designed by christopher kempster , who worked with sir christopher wren . however , abingdon 's failure to engage fully with the railway revolution , accepting only a branch line , sidelined the town in favour of reading which became the county town in 1869 . the corporation was reformed , under the municipal reform act 1835 and was abolished under the local government act 1972 . in 1974 , under local government reorganisation , abingdon became part of the non-metropolitan shire county of oxfordshire and the seat of the new vale of white horse district council , with abingdon becoming a civil parish with a town council . since the 1980s , abingdon has played host to a number of information communication companies , with many based in the town 's respective business and science parks . with this , and the result of abingdon 's proximity to academic and scientific institutions in oxford , the town has seen an influx of young professionals taking residence in the town 's many residential areas such as peachcroft . local councillors voted in november 2011 to rename the town back to its former name of '' abingdon-on-thames '' , though this would need approval from the vale of white horse council . this approval was granted on 23 february 2012 . . leisure and media . sport and recreation facilities include the white horse leisure and tennis centre , tilsley park and the southern town park . abingdon had four cinemas but all have closed . the last was the regal , which closed in 1989 . it stood derelict for 24 years until it was demolished in 2003 and replaced by housing development , regal close . the unicorn theatre was built in an area called the checkers hall in the ruins of the abbey buildings and shows plays and films on an irregular basis . in addition , a new cinema , called the abbey cinema has been built in one of the town council buildings and operates in conjunction with the regal in evesham . the local newspapers are the oxford times , oxford mail and abingdon herald . the oxfordshire guardian , a free newspaper , was based in abingdon for many years and was founded as the south oxfordshire courier until its closure in 2018 . local radio and television stations are shared with oxford , although itv retains a news gathering centre in nearby milton park ( formerly having a broadcasting studio in the town ) for itv meridian . historically the itv franchise was itv central . local analogue radio is provided by bbc radio oxford , jack fm , jack 3 and heart south ( historically 'fox fm ' and later 'heart thames valley ' ) , while the town is also covered by the oxfordshire dab multiplex . there was a six tv local tv channel until 2009 and the town 's abingdon & witney college was the home to the that 's tv studios for oxfordshire until it relocated to oxford science park . that 's tv - contact us the tesco extra store west of the town is the largest supermarket in abingdon and has historically been one of the most profitable tesco stores in the country . nearby is the fairacres retail park , thought to be the first retail park in the uk and recently redeveloped , which includes argos , subway , b & m , dreams and pets at home stores . it originally had two long established abingdon retailers—vineys home furnishings ( now part of the lee longlands chain but retains its name ) and mays carpets ( now part of the carpetright chain and has re-branded accordingly ) . in the town centre , many independent stores , estate agents and charity shops make up the bury street shopping centre as major high street names have chosen to go to other towns . however , a recent renovation has attracted stores such as new look , peacocks and whsmith to open branches . the town centre of abingdon was renovated in 2012 as part of the council 's redevelopment plan , with the 1970s shopping precinct converted to look more modern . the roads around the area have been changed : notably the one-way system around the centre has been partially changed to two-way . while this has slightly reduced traffic within the historic town centre , congestion has greatly increased elsewhere . local businesses have also complained that the increased traffic has driven shoppers away . redevelopment of the old gaol site , most recently a leisure centre , began in 2010 . the first stage was demolishing the 1970s additions and swimming pool extension . the gaol has been converted into luxury flats , shops and restaurants , with access to the riverside . sport . abingdon has two non-league football teams : abingdon united f.c . , who play at the armadillo energy stadium , and abingdon town f.c . , who play at culham road . abingdon golf club/north berks golf club ( now defunct ) was first mentioned in 1876 . the club disappeared at the time of the world war ii abingdon rufc was formed at the queens hotel on 27 february 1931 . during the 1930s the club was based at the queens hotel and games were played on the council owned recreation ground at caldecott road . immediately after the second world war the club moved to outside the raf camp ( now dalton barracks ) which offered on-site changing facilities and later a pitch inside the camp . at the start of the suez crisis in 1956 play temporarily returned to the caldecott road site because of security risks . this period saw the formation of the ill-fated abingdon sports club ; an amalgamation of the town 's rugby , cricket and hockey clubs and the bid to establish a sporting centre at hales meadow . in a short time the ground was developed and a pavilion erected but the organisation was plagued with financial difficulties and very soon dissolved with hockey disbanding and abingdon rugby remaining at the site as tenants to the cricket club . in the mid-1980s a determined effort was made to acquire grounds and a clubhouse dedicated to rugby . the current base at the town 's southern sports park was opened by former abingdon mp john patten mp in 1989 . abingdon has had members representing the county , progressing to first-class level and on to international status in the five nations tournament . the abingdon sevens traditionally opens the home counties ' playing season and has attracted sides from throughout the country and beyond . initiated in 1956 as a one-off tournament to celebrate the town 's 400th anniversary of receiving a royal charter , it proved so successful that the competition has been held on an annual basis ever since . several years ago it was decided to introduce the youngsters of abingdon to club rugby . the youth section has 200 playing members from the ages of 6 to 18 . in 2013–14 abingdon rfc 's president , paul murphy mbe , was also

part in county cross-country leagues . it changed its name from abingdon amblers to abingdon athletics club . they train at tilsley park . economy . industrially , abingdon was best known for the mg car factory , which opened in 1929 . 1,155,032 cars were made at the plant over the next 51 years until british leyland closed it on 24 october 1980 . subsequent cars sold under the mg brand have since been produced either at longbridge in birmingham or at saic 's factories in china . the pavlova and gloria leather works were major employers but both are now closed . alfred booth and company of liverpool traded with the pavlova leather syndicate from 1860 , bought a share in it in 1917–18 and took it over in 1921 . in may 1947 at the annual british industries fair in birmingham , pavlova advertised doe skins , chamois , lambskins and goatskins , much of it as suede , for uses including shoes , gloves and belts . in 1958 pavlova 's site covered , employed neary 200 people and included a staff sports field . at that time its factory still processed imported skins of sheep , lamb and goat , mainly to make suede . garner group took over the booth group in 1979 and became garner booth . pittards plc took over garner booth in 1987 and became pittard garner . it closed the pavlova works in 1993 . abingdon was originally home to the morland brewery , whose most famous ale was old

benedictine abingdon abbey there remains a beautiful perpendicular gateway ( common local knowledge , however , is that it was actually rebuilt out of the rubble of the original , and a little cursory

remains from the former abbey include the unicorn theatre and long gallery , which are still used for plays and functions including an annual craft fair . abbey gateway between the abingdon county hall museum and the guildhall remains a point of local importance . although it is unclear how far back this tradition dates , some people from families that have lived in the town for generations
