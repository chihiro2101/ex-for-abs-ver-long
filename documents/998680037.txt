Guercino

biography . giovanni francesco barbieri was born into a family of peasant farmers in cento , a town in the po valley mid-way between bologna and ferrara . mahon , 1937a being strabismus , at an early age he acquired the nickname by which he is universally known , guercino ( a diminutive of the italian noun guercio , meaning 'squinter ' ) . turner , 2003 mainly self-taught , at the age of 16 , he worked as apprentice in the shop of benedetto gennari , a painter of the bolognese school . griswold 1991 , p . 6 an early commission was for the decoration with frescos ( 1615–1616 ) of casa pannini in cento , where the naturalism of his landscapes already reveals considerable artistic independence . stone , pp . 3 , 37 . in bologna , he was winning the praise of ludovico carracci . he always acknowledged that his early style had been influenced by study of a madonna painted by ludovico carracci for the capuchin church in cento , affectionately known as '' la carraccina '' . his painting et in arcadia ego from around 1618–1622 contains the first known usage anywhere of the latin motto , later taken up by poussin and others , signifying that death lurks even in the most idyllic setting . the dramatic composition of this canvas ( related to his flaying of marsyas by apollo ( 1617–1618 ) created for the grand duke of tuscany , which shares the same pair of shepherds ) is typical of guercino 's early works , which are often tumultuous in conception . griswold 1991 , p . 13 he painted two large canvases , samson seized by philistines ( 1619 ) and elijah fed by ravens ( 1620 ) , for cardinal serra , a papal legate to ferrara . vivian , 1971 painted at a time when it is unlikely that guercino could have seen caravaggio 's work in rome , these works nevertheless display a starkly naturalistic caravaggesque style . rome . guercino was recommended by marchese enzo bentivoglio to the newly elected bolognese ludovisi pope , pope gregory xv in 1621 . lawrence gowing , ed . , biographical encyclopedia of artists , v.2 ( facts on file , 2005 ) : 291 . the years he spent in rome , 1621–23 , were very productive . from this period are his frescoes aurora at the casino of the villa ludovisi , the ceiling in san crisogono ( 1622 ) of san chrysogonus in glory , the portrait of pope gregory xv ( now in the getty museum ) , and the st . petronilla altarpiece for st . peter 's basilica in the vatican ( now in the museo capitolini ) . return to bologna . following the death of gregory xv in 1623 , guercino returned to his hometown of cento . in 1626 , he began his frescoes in the piacenza . the details of his career after 1629 are well documented in the account book , the libro dei conti di casa barbieri , that guercino and his brother paolo antonio barbieri , a notable painter of still lifes , kept updated , and which has been preserved . griswold 1991 , p . 35 between 1618 and 1631 , giovanni battista pasqualini produced 67 engravings that document the early production of guercino , which is not included in the libro dei conti . in 1642 , following the death of his commercial rival guido reni , guercino moved his busy workshop to bologna , where he was now able to take over reni 's role as the city 's leading painter of sacred subjects . some of his later works are closer to the style of reni , and are painted with much greater luminosity and clarity than his early works with their prominent use of chiaroscuro . in 1655 , the franciscan order of reggio paid him 300 ducats for the altarpiece of saint luke displaying a painting of the madonna and child ( now in nelson-atkins museum of art , kansas city ) . the corsini also paid him 300 ducats for the flagellation of christ painted in 1657 . works and pupils . guercino was remarkable for the extreme rapidity of his executions : he completed no fewer than 106 large altarpieces for churches , and his other paintings amount to about 144 . he was also a prolific draftsman . his production includes many drawings , usually in ink , washed ink , or red chalk . most of them were made as preparatory studies for his paintings , but he also drew landscapes , genre works , and caricatures for his own enjoyment . guercino 's drawings are known for their fluent style in which '' rapid , calligraphic pen strokes combined with dots , dashes , and parallel hatching lines describe the forms '' . griswold 1991 , p . 36 guercino continued to paint and teach until his death in 1666 , amassing a notable fortune . as he never married , his estate passed to his nephews and pupils , benedetto gennari ii and cesare gennari . other pupils include giulio coralli , orlandi , 1719 , p . 207 giuseppe bonati of ferrara , orlandi , p . 207 cristoforo serra of cesena , orlandi ,
