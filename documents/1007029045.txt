Modernity

etymology . the late latin adjective modernus , a derivation from the adverb modo '' presently , just now '' , is attested from the 5th century , at first in the context of distinguishing the christian era from the pagan era . in the 6th century , cassiodorus appears to have been the first writer to use modernus '' modern '' regularly to refer to his own age . the terms antiquus and modernus were used in a chronological sense in the carolingian era . for example , a magister modernus referred to a contemporary scholar , as opposed to old authorities such as benedict of nursia . in early medieval usage , modernus referred to authorities younger than pagan antiquity and the early church fathers , but not necessarily to the present day , and could include authors several centuries old , from about the time of bede , i.e . referring to the time after the foundation of the order of saint benedict and/or the fall of the western roman empire . the latin adjective was adopted in middle french , as moderne , by the 15th century , and hence , in the early tudor period , into early modern english . the early modern word meant '' now existing '' , or '' pertaining to the present times '' , not necessarily with a positive connotation . shakespeare uses modern in the sense of '' every-day , ordinary , commonplace '' . the word entered wide usage in the context of the late 17th-century quarrel of the ancients and the moderns within the académie française , debating the question of '' is modern culture superior to classical ( græco–roman ) culture ? '' in the context of this debate , the '' ancients '' ( anciens ) and '' moderns '' ( modernes ) were proponents of opposing views , the former believing that contemporary writers could do no better than imitate the genius of classical antiquity , while the latter , first with charles perrault ( 1687 ) , proposed that more than a mere '' renaissance '' of ancient achievements , the '' age of reason '' had gone beyond what had been possible in the classical period . the term modernity , first coined in the 1620s , in this context assumed the implication of a historical epoch following the renaissance , in which the achievements of antiquity were surpassed . phases . modernity has been associated with cultural and intellectual movements of 1436–1789 and extending to the 1970s or later . according to marshall berman , modernity is periodized into three conventional phases dubbed '' early , '' '' classical , '' and '' late , '' respectively , by peter osborne : early modernity : 1500–1789 ( or 1453–1789 in traditional historiography ) people were beginning to experience a more modern life ( laughey , 31 ) . classical modernity : 1789–1900 ( corresponding to the long 19th century ( 1789–1914 ) in hobsbawm 's scheme ) consisted of the rise and growing use of daily newspapers , telegraphs , telephones and other forms of mass media , which influenced the growth of communicating on a broader scale ( laughey , 31 ) . late modernity : 1900–1989 consisted of the globalization of modern life ( laughey , 31 ) . in the second phase berman draws upon the growth of modern technologies such as the newspaper , telegraph and other forms of mass media . there was a great shift into modernization in the name of industrial capitalism . finally in the third phase , modernist arts and individual creativity marked the beginning of a new modernist age as it combats oppressive politics , economics as well as other social forces including mass media . some authors , such as lyotard and baudrillard , believe that modernity ended in the mid- or late 20th century and thus have defined a period subsequent to modernity , namely postmodernity ( 1930s/1950s/1990s–present ) . other theorists , however , regard the period from the late 20th century to the present as merely another phase of modernity ; zygmunt bauman . further reading . adem , seifudein . 2004 .
