Chaconne

history . though it originally emerged during the late sixteenth century in spain culture , having reputedly been introduced from the new world , as a quick dance-song characterized by suggestive movements and mocking texts , alexander silbiger , '' chaconne , '' the new grove dictionary of music and musicians , ed . stanley sadie and j . tyrrell ( london : macmillan , 2001 ) . by the early eighteenth century the chaconne had evolved into a slow triple metre instrumental form . alex ross describes the origins of the chacona as actually having been a sexily swirling dance that appeared in south america at the end of the sixteenth century and quickly spread to europe . the dance became popular both in the elite courts and in the general population .
