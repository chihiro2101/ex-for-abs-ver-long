GeForce 2 series

architecture . thumb the geforce 2 architecture is similar to the previous geforce 256 line but with various improvements . compared to the 220 nm geforce 256 , geforce 2 is built on a 180 & nbsp ; nm manufacturing process , making the silicon more dense and allowing for more transistors and a higher clock speed . the most significant change for 3d acceleration is the addition of a second texture mapping unit to each of the four pixel pipelines . some say the second tmu was there in the original geforce nsr ( nvidia shading rasterizer ) but dual-texturing was disabled due to a hardware bug ; nsr 's unique ability to do single-cycle trilinear texture filtering supports this suggestion . this doubles the texture fillrate per clock compared to the previous generation and is the reasoning behind the geforce 2 gts 's naming suffix : gigatexel shader ( gts ) . the geforce 2 also formally introduces the nsr ( nvidia shading rasterizer ) , a primitive type of programmable pixel pipeline that is somewhat similar to later pixel shaders . this functionality is also present in geforce 256 but was unpublicized . another hardware enhancement is an upgraded video processing pipeline , called hdvp ( high definition video processor ) . hdvp supports motion video playback at hdtv-resolutions ( mp hl ) . in 3d benchmarks and gaming applications , the geforce 2 gts outperforms its predecessor by up to 40 % . in opengl games ( such as quake iii ) , the card outperforms the radeon r100 and 3dfx voodoo 5 cards in both 16 bpp and 32 bpp display modes . however , in direct3d games running 32 bpp , the radeon ddr is sometimes able to take the lead . the geforce 2 architecture is quite memory bandwidth constrained . the gpu wastes memory bandwidth and pixel fillrate due to unoptimized z-buffer usage , drawing of hidden surfaces , and a relatively inefficient ram controller . the main competition for geforce 2 , the ati radeon ddr , has hardware functions ( called hyperz ) that address these issues . because of the inefficient nature of the geforce 2 gpus , they could not approach their theoretical performance potential and the radeon , even with its significantly less powerful 3d architecture , offered strong competition . the later nv17 revision of the nv11 design , used for the geforce 4 mx , was more efficient . releases . the first models to arrive after the original geforce 2 gts was the geforce 2 ultra and geforce2 mx , launched on september 7 , 2000 . on september 29 , 2000 nvidia started shipping graphics cards which had 16 and 32 mb of video memory size . architecturally identical to the gts , the ultra simply has higher core and memory clock rates . the ultra model actually outperforms the first geforce 3 products in some cases , due to initial geforce 3 cards having significantly lower fillrate . however , the ultra loses its lead when anti-aliasing is enabled , because of the geforce 3 's new memory bandwidth/fillrate efficiency mechanisms ; plus the geforce 3 has a superior next-generation feature set with programmable vertex and pixel shaders for directx 8.0 games . the geforce 2 pro , introduced shortly after the ultra , was an alternative to the expensive top-line ultra and is faster than the gts . in october 2001 , the geforce 2 ti was positioned as a cheaper and less advanced alternative to the geforce 3 . faster than the gts and pro but slower than the ultra , the geforce 2 ti performed competitively against the radeon r100 , although the 7500 had the advantage of dual-display support . this mid-range geforce 2 release was replaced by the geforce 4 mx series as the budget/performance choice in january 2002 . on their 2001 product web page , nvidia initially placed the ultra as a separate offering from the rest of the geforce 2 lineup ( gts , pro , ti ) , however by late 2002 with the geforce 2 considered a discontinued product line , the ultra was included along the gts , pro , and ti in the geforce 2 information page . geforce 2 mx . thumb since the previous geforce 256 line shipped without a budget variant , the riva tnt2 series was left to fill the '' low-end '' role—albeit with a comparably obsolete feature set . in order to create a better low-end option , nvidia created the geforce 2 mx series , which offered a set of standard features , specific to the entire geforce 2 generation , limited only by categorical tier . the geforce 2 mx cards had two 3d pixel pipelines removed and a reduced available memory bandwidth . the cards utilized either sdr sdram or ddr sdram with memory bus widths ranging from 32-bit to 128-bits , allowing circuit board cost to be varied . the mx series also provided dual-display support , something not found in the regular geforce 256 and geforce 2 . the prime competitors to the geforce 2 mx series were ati 's radeon r100 and radeon sdr ( which with the other r100 's was later renamed as part of the 7200 series ) . the radeon ve had the advantage of somewhat better dual-monitor display software , but it did not offer hardware t & l , an emerging 3d rendering feature of the day that was the major attraction of direct3d 7 . further , the radeon ve featured only a single rendering pipeline , causing it to produce a substantially lower fillrate than the geforce 2 mx . the radeon sdr , equipped with sdr sdram instead of ddr sdram found in more expensive brethren , was released some time later , and exhibited faster 32-bit 3d rendering than the geforce 2 mx . however , the radeon sdr lacked multi-monitor support and debuted at a considerable higher price point than the geforce 2 mx . 3dfx 's voodoo4 4500 arrived too late , as well as being too expensive , but too slow to compete with the geforce 2 mx . members of the series include geforce 2 mx , mx400 , mx200 , and mx100 . the gpu was also used as an integrated graphics processor in the nforce chipset line and as a mobile graphics chip for notebooks called geforce 2 go . successor . the successor to the geforce 2 ( non-mx ) line is the geforce 3 . the non-mx geforce 2 line was reduced in price and saw the addition of the geforce 2 ti , in order to offer a mid-range alternative to the high-end geforce 3 product . later , the entire geforce 2 line was replaced with the geforce 4 mx . models . support . nvidia has ceased driver support for geforce 2 series , ending with gts , pro , ti and ultra models in 2005 and then with mx models in 2007 . geforce 2 gts , geforce 2 pro , geforce 2 ti and geforce 2 ultra : windows 9x & windows me : 71.84 released on march 11 , 2005 ;
