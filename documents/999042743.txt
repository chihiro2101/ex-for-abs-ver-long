Ford Taunus

taunus g93a ( 1939–1942 ) / g73a ( 1948–1952 ) . the ford taunus g93a was a development of the ford eifel , and used the same 1172-cc four cylinder engine , but in a longer chassis and a streamlined body . it was the first german ford to have hydraulic brakes . due to the war , production was interrupted from 1942 to 1948 ; 7,128 were made , including estate cars and light vans . taunus m-series ( 1952–1968 ) . from 1952 to 1968 , all german fords were called the taunus , using the model names 12m , 15m , 17m , 20m , and 26m ( on some scandinavian markets , for a short while the branding 10m was used on a slightly better-equipped export version of the early taunus , which is said to be the precursor of later uses ) . the '' m '' is said to stand for '' meisterstück '' , in english '' masterpiece '' , but that word was found to be already registered by another german automaker . taunus was also sometimes adopted as the brand name in export markets , particularly where british and north american fords were also available . the 12m , 15m , and 17m models had a stone engine , which in the first 12m was a carryover of the sidevalve ( flathead ) engine from the first taunus series , and beginning with the 15m , it was replaced by an overhead-valve design similar to the british ford consul engine . with the introduction of the new 12m line ( internal code p4 ) for 1962 came the v4 engine , which starting in late 1964 with the larger 17m/20m became the base engine for the taunus m-series . the 20m and 26m models had the ford cologne v6 engine , which is basically the same engine design with two extra cylinders added . the 12 , 15 , 17 , etc . numbers refer to the engine displacement ; 1200 , 1500 , 1700 & nbsp ; cc , etc . however , a few exceptions from that rule were made , such as 17m 1800 , which was powered by the v6 in its smallest displacement of 90.777 l and the 20m 2300s ( in the later p7 series ) , which used a 2.3-l version of the same engine . from 1962 to 1970 , the smaller models 12m ( p4 ) and its successor 12m/15m ( p6 ) had front wheel drive . all other models had rear-wheel drive . these models were offered : . smaller line : 12m , 15m . . first generation 12m ( g13 ) ( 1952–1959 ) , 15m ( 1955–1959 ) . the ford taunus p1 was the first new german ford after world war ii . it featured ponton styling , similar in style to british ford zephyr . something else the new ford taunus 12m had in common with british fords was the retention of an old side-valve engine at a time when competitors were increasingly moving over to overhead-valve units . the taunus 15m used a new and more powerful engine : 12m : 1172 cc , 38 & nbsp ; hp ( 28 & nbsp ; kw ) , 112 & nbsp ; km/h ( 70 & nbsp ; mph ) 15m : 1498 cc , 55 & nbsp ; hp ( 40 & nbsp ; kw ) , 128 & nbsp ; km/h ( 80 & nbsp ; mph ) body styles were two-door sedan , two-door station wagon , and sedan delivery . second generation 12m ( 1959–1962 ) . the second generation 12m was not a new car , but a reworking of the 1952 model . all cars were called 12m , though both engines were continued . the car with the bigger engine was called taunus 12m 1.5-litre . body styles were the same as in the 1952 model . third generation 12m ( p4 ) ( 1962–1966 ) . the new ford taunus p4 was similar in size , but a completely new car based on the ford cardinal project : new body , new v4 engine , front-wheel drive . it was the first ford car with front-wheel drive ( second is ford corcel , third is ford fiesta ) . engines available included : 1.2 litre : 1183 cc , 40 & nbsp ; hp ( 29 & nbsp ; kw ) , 123 & nbsp ; km/h ( 77 & nbsp ; mph ) 1.5 litre : 1498 cc , 50 , 55 or 65 & nbsp ; hp ( 37 , 40 or 48 & nbsp ; kw ) , 135 , 139 or 144 & nbsp ; km/h ( 84 , 87 or 90 & nbsp ; mph ) body styles were two-door sedan , four-door sedan , two-door coupé , two-door station wagon , and sedan delivery . fourth generation 12m ( p6 ) ( 1966–1970 ) , 15m ( p6 ) ( 1966–1970 ) . the ford taunus p6 came with new bodies , whilst engines and platform were continued . the car with the bigger engine was now called 15m again . engines available included : 12m 1.2 litre : 1183 cc , 45 & nbsp ; hp ( 33 & nbsp ; kw ) , 125 & nbsp ; km/h ( 78 & nbsp ; mph ) 12m 1.3 litre : 1305 cc , 50 or 53 & nbsp ; hp ( 37 or 39 & nbsp ; kw ) , 130 or 134 & nbsp ; km/h ( 81 or 84 & nbsp ; mph ) 15m 1.5 litre : 1498 cc , 55 or 65 & nbsp ; hp ( 40 or 47 & nbsp ; kw ) , 136 or 145 & nbsp ; km/h ( 85 or 90 & nbsp ; mph ) 15m 1.7 litre : 1699 cc , 70 or 75 & nbsp ; hp ( 51 or 55 & nbsp ; kw ) , 153 or 158 & nbsp ; km/h ( 95 or 98 & nbsp ; mph ) body styles were unchanged from the p4 . in 1970 , the p6 was replaced by the taunus tc . bigger line : 17m , 20m , 26m . . first generation 17m ( p2 ) ( 1957–1960 ) . growing prosperity in postwar germany encouraged ford to offer a line of bigger and more expensive cars . the ford taunus p2 was as long as ( though significantly narrower than ) the british consul mk2 , but a different car . it presented a style similar to american 1955 fords , featuring substantial ( at least by european standards ) tailfins . the transatlantic flamboyance of the car 's styling gained it the sobriquet '' baroque taunus '' , showing styling influences from the north american mercury monterey of the same time period . unusually for middle-class german cars of this period , it was available with either two or four doors . the competition noticed , and from 1959 , buying an opel rekord with four doors was possible . the p2 used an overhead-valve ( ohv ) engine with 1698 cc and 60 & nbsp ; hp ( 44 & nbsp ; kw ) . a maximum speed of 128 & nbsp ; km/h ( 80 & nbsp ; mph ) was quoted . a road test of the time commended the smoothness of the three-speed , all-synchromesh manual transmission system . . second generation 17m ( p3 ) ( 1960–1964 ) . the ford taunus p3 had a completely new body in a very modern style . the look of car reminded some critics of a bath tub , and it consequently gained the soubriquet '' taunus badewanne '' . at a time when competitors boasted that all four corners of the vehicles were visible from the driver 's seat , the new taunus instead offered a streamlined form . however , in germany the concept of streamlining in cars was associated with narrow passenger cabins reminiscent of the 1930s and of the still popular volkswagen type 1 . the new taunus , however , provided greater interior width than its predecessor , despite being no wider on the outside . although the 1.7-litre version was launched with the same 60 ps power output as the outgoing model , the new model was a full 10 & nbsp ; km/h ( 6 & nbsp ; mph ) faster , which was attributed to improved aerodynamics and a lighter body shell . the front end styling is reminiscent of the 1961 u.s . ford thunderbird and lincoln continental . three engine sizes were now offered : 1.5 litre : 1498 cc , 55 & nbsp ; hp ( 40 & nbsp ; kw ) , 136 & nbsp ; km/h ( 85 & nbsp ; mph ) 1.7 litre : 1698 cc , 60 or 65 & nbsp ; hp ( 44 or 48 & nbsp ; kw ) , 138 or 140 & nbsp ; km/h ( 86 or 88 & nbsp ; mph ) 1.8 litre : 1758 cc , 70 or 75 & nbsp ; hp ( 51 or 55 & nbsp ; kw ) , 148 or 154 & nbsp ; km/h ( 92 or 96 & nbsp ; mph ) . third generation 17m ( p5 ) ( 1964–1967 ) , 20m ( p5 ) ( 1964–1967 ) . the ford taunus p5 came with a new body and new engines . the 17m now gets a v4 engine : 1.5 litre : 1498 cc , 60 & nbsp ; hp ( 44 & nbsp ; kw ) , 140 & nbsp ; km/h ( 88 & nbsp ; mph ) 1.7 litre : 1699 cc , 65 or 70 & nbsp ; hp ( 48 or 51 & nbsp ; kw ) , 145 or 150 & nbsp ; km/h ( 91 or 94 & nbsp ; mph ) . new 20m gets a v6 engine with 1.8 litres and 82 & nbsp ; hp , or 2.0 litres ( 1998 cc ) and 85 or 90 & nbsp ; hp ( 63 or 66 & nbsp ; kw ) with a top speed of 158 or 161 & nbsp ; km/h ( 99 or 101 & nbsp ; mph ) . again , it was a good selling car . fourth generation 17m ( p7 ) ( 1967–1968 ) , 20m ( p7 ) ( 1967–1968 ) . for the new ford p7 , there was a new body ; engines and platform were carried over from the p5 . rear lights were no longer mounted at corners . the 20m-model had a fake air scoop on thr bonnet and a new , bigger engine . the engines of the 17m/20m p5 were continued , with only one addition on the top end . it was the 20m 2.3 litre : 2293 cc , 108 & nbsp ; hp ( 79 & nbsp ; kw ) , 170 & nbsp ; km/h ( 106 & nbsp ; mph ) . fifth generation 17m ( p7b ) , 20m , 26m ( 1968–1971 ) . shrinking sales of the p7 forced ford to offer a restyled car only one year later , and the new car was again called p7 . rear lights again mounted on corners . here , to avoid confusion , it was called p7.2 , sometimes it is called p7b . the name '' taunus '' no longer used . the 26m , introduced in 1969 , is the top-of-the-line version with a new bigger engine ( 2.6 litres ) , bigger brakes , dual headlights , power steering , and the most luxurious trim level . v6-engines were slightly revised . the engine programme is enlarged ; now , two base engines ( v4 and v6 ) in six displacement sizes and nine power stages are available : v4 17m 1.5 litre : 1498 cc , 60 & nbsp ; hp ( 44 & nbsp ; kw ) , 135 & nbsp ; km/h ( 85 & nbsp ; mph ) 17m 1.7 litre : 1699 cc , 65 or 75 & nbsp ; hp ( 48 or 55 & nbsp ; kw ) , 140 or 150 & nbsp ; km/h ( 88 or 94 & nbsp ; mph ) v6 17m 1.8 litre : 1812 cc , 82 & nbsp ; hp ( 60 & nbsp ; kw ) , 153 & nbsp ; km/h ( 96 & nbsp ; mph ) 20m 2.0 litre : 1998 cc , 85 or 90 & nbsp ; hp ( 63 or 66 & nbsp ; kw ) , 155 or 160 & nbsp ; km/h ( 97 or 100 & nbsp ; mph ) 20m 2.3 litre : 2293 cc , 108 or 125 & nbsp ; hp ( 79 or 92 & nbsp ; kw ) , 170 or 180 & nbsp ; km/h ( 106 or 112 & nbsp ; mph ) 20m 2.6 litre , 26m : 2550 cc , 125 & nbsp ; hp ( 92 & nbsp ; kw ) , 180 & nbsp ; km/h ( 112 & nbsp ; mph ) , optional on 20m , but standard on 26m . ; ford 20m rs the ford 20m rs coupé was made in germany as a ( 2300 s ) p7b and ( 2600 ) p7b . in the 1968 london-sydney marathon , ford entered three ford 20m rs from germany and belgium . in 1969 , a ford 20m rs won the safari and occasionally a capri was seen with works involvement . this is the last specifically german ford . in early 1972 , it is replaced by the new consul and granada . taunus tc ( 1970–1975 ) . in 1970 a new taunus , the taunus cortina ( tc ) , was introduced . ford offered a two- or four-door sedan or a five-door station wagon/estate ( identified like previous taunus estates as the turnier ) . between 1970 and 1975 , for the first taunus tc , a fashionable fast-back coupé was also included in the taunus range . this model also formed the basis of the ford cortina , but with different door skins and rear wing pressings from the '' coke-bottle '' styling of the cortina . in addition , there was never a cortina iii equivalent to the fast-back bodied taunus tc coupé . the taunus tc and cortina mk.iii were both developed under the auspices of ford of europe , and most major components including key parts of the bodyshell were identical . taunus tc2 ( 1976–1979 ) and tc3 ( 1979–1982/1994 ) . at the end of november 1975 , in time for the 1976 model year , production began of the taunus series '' gbts '' . the taunus and cortina mk iv were in most cases now almost identical , apart from regional variations ( in terms of specification changes and trim levels ) . the taunus tc along with the cortina mk iii and their successors have been produced in slightly updated forms in europe , argentina and widely across asia by ford or their local co-operators . cortinas were also built in small numbers starting with the predecessor cortina mk ii throughout the model series ' european/east asian lifespan under license by korean automaker hyundai . this led to the cortina 80 at the end of its production life serving as a starting point for the first hyundai stellar which succeeded the cortina line in south korea , handing over some major technical components such as the steering rack and the transmission propelling shaft to the otherwise non-ford successor . in 1982 production of the taunus ceased in europe ; it was replaced by the ford sierra . the sierra carried over the cortina/taunus ohc pinto engines and rwd configuration but was otherwise an all new car with independent suspension all round . production in argentina and turkey . the taunus was produced in argentina from 1974 up until the end of 1984 , when the production assembly was sold to turkey to manufacture the otosan taunus . the turkish car , easily distinguishable because of its remolded front and back panels continued in production until 1993 . notable media appearances . a black 1976 model taunus was driven by henchman chasing james bond ( roger moore ) - in his lotus esprit - in the 1977 film the spy who loved me on the roads of sardinia . a notable passenger of the taunus was the iconic jaws ( richard kiel ) , who was presumably the only survivor when bond managed to shake off the pursuing car and cause it to overshoot a cliff and plough into the roof of a barn . a blue 1948 model taunus was driven by steve forrest in the very first episode of the 1965 tv series the baron . a couple of different tc2 ford taunus models were driven by barry foster in his portrayal as amsterdam detective van der valk in the original series a 1979 ford taunus is a main feature of the swedish television show byhåla . modified taunus tcs are used as the omega forces patrol vehicles in the italian film warrior of the lost world . . literature . . references . external links . dutch ford taunus gt and ford osi page austrian ford taunus site ( english language ) german ford taunus site german ford taunus-board ( mainly german language , but also english and others ) german site for m-series 1952 - 1972 swiss ford taunus site hungarian ford taunus site taunus 20m used as unmarked u.s . military sedan in cold war berlin
