Cornelius Cardew

biography . cardew was born in winchcombe , gloucestershire . he was the second of three sons whose parents were both artists—his father was the potter michael cardew . the family moved to wenford bridge pottery cornwall a few years after his birth where he was first nurtured as a chorister at canterbury cathedral , and later at the king 's school , canterbury which had evacuated to the carlyon bay hotel for the war . his musical career thus began as a chorister . from 1953 to 1957 , cardew studied piano , cello , and composition at the royal academy of music in london . career . having won a scholarship to study at the recently established studio for electronic music in cologne , cardew served as an assistant to karlheinz stockhausen from 1958 to 1960 . he was given the task of independently working out the composition plans for the german composer 's score carré , and stockhausen noted : as a musician he was outstanding because he was not only a good pianist but also a good improviser and i hired him to become my assistant in the late 50s and he worked with me for over three years . i gave him work to do which i have never given to any other musician , which means to work with me on the score i was composing . he was one of the best examples that you can find among musicians because he was well informed about the latest theories of composition as well as being a performer . . indeterminacy and american experimentalists . in 1958 , cardew witnessed a series of concerts in cologne by john cage and david tudor which had a considerable influence on him , leading him to abandon post-schönbergian serial composition and develop the indeterminate and experimental scores for which he is best known . he was particularly prominent in introducing the works of american experimental composers such as morton feldman , la monte young , earle brown , christian wolff , and cage to an english audience during the early to mid sixties and came to have a considerable impact on the development of english music from the late sixties onwards . cardew 's most important scores from his experimental period are treatise ( 1963–67 ) , a 193-page graphic score which allows for considerable freedom of interpretation , and the great learning , a work in seven parts or '' paragraphs , '' based on translations of confucius by ezra pound . the great learning instigated the formation of the scratch orchestra . during those years , he took a course in graphic design and he made his living as a graphic designer at aldus books in london . in 1966 , cardew joined the free improvisation group amm as cellist and pianist . amm had formed the previous year and included english jazz musicians lou gare , eddie prévost , keith rowe , and one of his first students at the royal academy christopher hobbs . performing with the group allowed cardew to explore music in a completely democratic environment , freely improvising without recourse to scores . while teaching an experimental music class at london 's morley college in 1968 , cardew , along with howard skempton and michael parsons formed the scratch orchestra , a large experimental ensemble , initially for the purposes of interpreting cardew 's the great learning . the scratch orchestra gave performances throughout britain and elsewhere until its demise in 1972 . it was during this period that the question of art for whom was hotly debated within the context of the orchestra , which cardew came to see as elitist despite its numerous attempts to make socially accessible music . taylor , timothy d . , ( author ) .
