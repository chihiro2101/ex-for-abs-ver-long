Steppenwolf (band)

history . the sparrows . in 1965 john kay joined the sparrows , a popular canadian band , and was followed by goldy mcjohn . the group eventually broke up . . breakthrough success and decline ( 1967–1972 ) . in late 1967 , gabriel mekler urged kay to re-form the sparrows and suggested the name change to steppenwolf , inspired by hermann hesse 's 1927 steppenwolf ( novel ) . steppenwolf 's first two singles were '' a girl i knew '' and '' sookie sookie '' . the band finally rocketed to worldwide fame after their third single , '' born to be wild '' , was released in 1968 , as well as their version of hoyt axton 's '' the pusher '' . both of these tunes were used prominently in the 1969 counterculture cult film easy rider ( both titles originally had been released on the band 's debut album ) . in the movie , '' the pusher '' accompanies a drug deal , and peter fonda stuffing dollar bills into his stars and stripes-clad fuel tank , after which '' born to be wild '' is heard in the opening credits , with fonda and dennis hopper riding their harley choppers through the america of the late 1960s . the song , which has been closely associated with motorcycles ever since , introduced to rock lyrics the signature term '' heavy metal '' ( though not about a kind of music , but about a motorcycle : '' i like smoke and lightning , heavy metal thunder , racin ' with the wind . '' ) . written by sparrow guitarist dennis edmonton , who had begun using the pen name mars bonfire and inspired by a billboard roadside advertisement bonfire liked which depicted a motorcycle tearing through the billboard artwork , the song had already reached number two on the billboard hot 100 in august 1968 . it sold over one million copies , and was awarded a gold disc . in 1968 , steppenwolf played one of their biggest shows up to that time at the fillmore east to rave reviews , sharing the bill with buddy rich and children of god . on november 27 , 1968 , they played a concert with iron butterfly at the baltimore civic center . the group 's following albums had several more hit singles , including '' magic carpet ride '' ( which reached number three ) from the second and '' rock me '' ( with its bridge lasting 1:06 , which reached number 10 ) from at your birthday party . it also sold in excess of a million units . monster , which questioned us vietnam war policy , was the band 's most political album . following the monster album from 1969 , the following year , the band released steppenwolf 7 , which included the song '' snowblind friend '' , another hoyt axton-penned song about the era and attitudes of drugs and associated problems . the band lineup for their live performances in the middle of 1970 was john kay , jerry edmonton , goldy mcjohn , larry byrom , and george biondo . this lineup was also unable to remain together , as byrom became upset with mcjohn over personal issues and quit the band in the early part of 1971 . several changes in the group 's personnel were made after the first few years . moreve was fired from the group in 1968 for missing gigs after he became afraid to return to los angeles , convinced by his girlfriend that it was going to be leveled by an earthquake and fall into the sea . rob black briefly filled in for moreve until former sparrow bandmate nick st . nicholas came aboard in the latter months of 1968 . monarch quit the group in august 1969 as his relationship with kay deteriorated . larry byrom , who had been in time with nick st . nicholas , ably replaced monarch . nick st . nicholas was let go in mid-1970 . he had supposedly appeared in nothing but rabbit ears and a jock strap at the fillmore east in april 1970 – and his habit of wearing muumuus and kaftans on stage began to wear on kay , whose penchant for leather vests and pants was more in line with the image he wanted for the band . george biondo was then recruited , and guitarist kent henry replaced byrom in early 1971 . in november 1971 , the band released for ladies only , with the lineup consisting of kay , henry , biondo , mcjohn , and edmonton . the album was notable for several reasons , most notably the controversial lp inside cover art , the romantic , political , and social lyrical content , and the fact that it featured several of the group members on lead vocals . breakup ( 1972–1973 ) . the band broke up after a farewell concert in los angeles on valentine 's day , 1972 . kay went on to a brief solo career , scoring a minor solo hit in 1972 with '' i 'm movin ' on '' from his album forgotten songs and unsung heroes . although it received generally high marks from most critics , the album sales were disappointing in the us . kay released a second solo album in 1973 on the dunhill label titled my sportin ' life . this album sold less than his first solo album and was less gritty and more la studio-polish in sound . following the first official breakup of steppenwolf , and after the release of kay 's first solo album , a late summer and autumn 1972 tour in the us and europe occurred , which featured kay heading both the john kay band and steppenwolf , at the top of the bill . dunhill had released an album of a collection of steppenwolf songs titled rest in peace . thus , the tour was known as the rip tour . the john kay band included hugh sullivan on keyboards and pentti glan on drums ( both were contributors to john kay 's first solo album ) . kent henry on lead and slide guitar and george biondo on bass joined kay in both lineups . the steppenwolf band lineup featured goldy mcjohn on keyboards and jerry edmonton on drums . this tour proved to be a fairly positive experience for all of the musicians and drew respectable crowd turnouts . following this tour , while kay was recording his second solo album in 1973 , mcjohn and edmonton continued to play and formed a band called manbeast . some of the material created in the manbeast days showed up on the 1974 steppenwolf reunion album , most notably '' gang war blues '' , which was recorded as a demo with edmonton singing slightly different lyrics . reunion ( 1974–1976 ) . steppenwolf reformed in 1974 with its core lineup of kay , edmonton , and mcjohn , along with longtime bassist biondo and newcomer bobby cochran , eddie cochran 's nephew , on lead guitar . the band signed with mums records in retaliation for what kay perceived as a lack of support by dunhill records for his solo albums . their first reunion album was slow flux , which included their last top 40 hit , '' straight shootin ' woman '' . in february 1975 , mcjohn was dismissed for what kay described as a decline in the quality of his performances , as well as erratic behavior . mcjohn was replaced by andy chapin on hour of the wolf in 1975 , though mcjohn appeared in artwork for the single to caroline . after the album peaked at number 155 , kay attempted to dissolve the band again , but the label , now having been absorbed by epic records , insisted steppenwolf record one more album to satisfy their contractual obligations . the ensuing album , skullduggery ( 1976 ) , featuring wayne cook on keyboards , was released without a tour to support it , and by the early fall of 1976 , steppenwolf disbanded a second time . kay appeared in a segment of the popular music tv show the midnight special to announce the end of steppenwolf and also played a solo version of the song '' hey i 'm alright '' . this song appeared on kay 's third solo album all in good time , released on mercury records in 1978 . . '' new steppenwolf '' revival act ( 1976–1980 ) . after kay disbanded steppenwolf , former members goldy mcjohn and nick st . nicholas formed a '' revival act '' called '' new steppenwolf '' . mcjohn did not last long , but st . nicholas continued with the venture for several years . various incarnations included , according to author dave thompson , a '' revolving door of musicians '' consisting of '' jobbing players '' . among those players were vocalist tom holland and drummer steve riley of future w.a.s.p . and l.a . guns fame . the rolling stone encyclopedia of rock & roll described these bands as '' unprofessional , bogus versions '' of steppenwolf . although kay and edmonton had originally licensed the use of the '' new steppenwolf '' name , they later sued for breach of the contract . st . nicholas agreed in 1980 to cease use of the name , but legal disputes about promotional use of the steppenwolf name continued until 2000 . . john kay and steppenwolf ( 1980–2018 ) . kay had a few meetings with david pesnell about management , concert promotions , and producing a new album for the band . pesnell wanted to produce an album featuring new songs on side a , by the reformed band three dog night and with side b of the album featuring songs by steppenwolf . the album 's working name was '' back to back '' , a play on each band having a side of the album and the fact the bands were back together again . pesnell 's concept was simple : each band should record four new songs , with a fifth song on each side featuring a medley of the band 's past songs . this would give the pesnell-produced album a double release of singles to support a concert tour featuring the two bands . though both bands liked the concept of the album and tour , the arguments included who would be side a and side b and which of the two would headline the upcoming concert tour . the reformed john kay and steppenwolf line-up featured john kay , michael palmer ( guitars , backing vocals ) , steve palmer ( drums , backing vocals ) , danny ironstone ( keyboards , backing vocals ) , and kurtis teel on bass . the palmer brothers had played in a group called tall water and had also been involved with kay in his solo career playing live gigs in the late 1970s . teel was replaced by chad peery and ironstone by brett tuggle by 1981 , and the new grouping released live in london overseas . tuggle was then displaced by michael wilk and a new studio album , wolftracks , was released in 1982 on the small attic ( nautilus in the u.s . ) record label . wolftracks was one of the earliest digitally recorded albums in the industry . it was recorded live on a two-track sony digital recording system . bassist welton gite , who appeared on this album , left shortly after its completion and was replaced by gary link , formerly with dokken . another album , paradox , followed in 1984 . in december 1984 the band as it was disbanded and kay and wilk decided to continue on in early 1985 with a pared-down quartet composed of kay , wilk , wilk 's friend ron hurst ( drums , backing vocals ) , and rocket ritchotte ( guitars , backing vocals ) . wilk also handled bass duties from his sequencing computer keyboards from then on . this line-up released rock n ' roll rebels ( 1987 ) and rise & shine ( 1990 ) ; these were on the qwil and i.r.s . records imprints , respectively . ritchotte had departed temporarily in 1989 to be replaced by les dudek and then steve fister , but then returned in 1990 for three more years . fister ( ex-iron butterfly ) came back in late 1993 , but turned guitar duties over to danny johnson ( formerly of derringer , rod stewart , and others ) in 1996 . as the band was named after the novel der steppenwolf by german author hermann hesse , who was born in the black forest town of calw , the city invited them to come over and play in the international hermann-hesse-festival 2002 , along with other bands inspired by hesse , such as anyone 's daughter . the concert drew considerable media coverage , with kay 's fluent german stunning those who did not know beforehand about his growing up in germany – in fact , he was born joachim fritz krauledat in tilsit , east prussia , germany ( now sovetsk , kaliningrad oblast , russia ) . the band performed what they then labeled their '' farewell concert '' on october 6 , 2007 , at ripken stadium in aberdeen , maryland , featuring kay , keyboardist and programmer michael wilk , drummer ron hurst and guitarist danny johnson . however , the band , rejoined by bassist gary link , began touring again in june 2009 . steppenwolf were nominated for the rock and roll hall of fame in 2017 , but were not inducted . on june 25 , 2019 , the new york times magazine listed steppenwolf among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 universal studios fire . on november 22 , 2019 , john kay announced that the band 's october 14 , 2018 show was their last . . band members . original lineup john kay – lead vocals , rhythm guitar , harmonica ( 1967–1972 , 1974–1976 , 1980-2018 ) michael monarch – lead guitar , backing vocals ( 1967-1969 ) rushton moreve – bass guitar , backing vocals ( 1967-1968 ) jerry edmonton – drums , backing vocals ( 1967-1972 ) goldy mcjohn – keyboards , backing vocals ( 1967-1972 ) final lineup john kay – lead vocals , rhythm guitar , harmonica ( 1967–1972 , 1974–1976 , 1980-2018 ) michael wilk – keyboards , backing vocals ( 1982-2018 ) gary link – bass , backing vocals ( 1982–2018 ) ron hurst – drums , backing vocals ( 1984–2018 ) danny johnson – lead guitar , backing vocals , mandolin ( 1996–2018 ) . discography . ;
