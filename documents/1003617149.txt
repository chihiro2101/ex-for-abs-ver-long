Braathens

history . far east . braathens south american & far east airtransport a/s was founded on 26 march 1946 by ludvig g . braathen through his shipping company ludvig g . braathens rederi and its holding company braganza . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 22 braathens had made good money during world war ii with the participation in the norwegian shipping and trade mission . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 30–31 his initial intentions were to fly crew and supplies to his and others ships throughout the world—primarily in the far east . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 17 braathen traveled to the united states , where he bought several used 44-passenger douglas c-54 ( dc-4 ) aircraft from the united states air force . twenty pilots were recruited and sent to fort worth for certification . the first plane , ln-hav norse explorer , landed at oslo airport , gardermoen on 26 december 1946 . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 31–34 the first service run from oslo to cairo via copenhagen and paris on 30 january 1947 . various charter services were provided , such as evacuating french and british personnel prior to the creation of israel . the first braathens safe flight was to the far east started on 24 february from oslo , with landings at amsterdam , marseille , cairo , basra , karachi , calcutta and bangkok before hong kong , where norske skyfarer landed on 8 march . total flight time was 46 hours . the only other services to the far east from europe were operated by klm and british overseas airways corporation . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 34–35 the regular services could be done with a round trip time of nine to ten days , including overnighting in cairo , karachi and bangkok , and with technical revision of the plane in hong kong . in 1947 , braathens safe flew twenty-five trips to hong kong , five to new york city and one to johannesburg . douglas dc-3 aircraft were introduced the same year for shorter charters . the following year , braathens safe started the first trial flights to south america . by 1948 the airline had weekly trips to the far east . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 35–43 the partially state-owned norwegian air lines ( dnl ) was granted a monopoly on all domestic and international flights during the late 1940s . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 27 they started the scandinavian airlines system ( sas ) cooperation and stated that they would start a route to the far east . braathens safe 's charters were by 1948 so regular that a concession would be needed . sas demanded preferential treatment , but braathens safe threatened to flag out and the government gave them a concession that lasted until 1954 , on condition they establish a technical base at stavanger airport , sola . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 39–46 the airline chose at the same time to move its main base from gardermoen to oslo airport , fornebu . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 47–49 the sas cooperation resulted in a full merger from 1951 , after a merger proposal from braathens safe had been rejected . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 49–54 braathens safe made proposals to expand its routes to new york and tokyo , but both were rejected by the government . the sas merger bound the government to issue the far east concession to sas , and braathens lost their international service rights then . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 54–62 braathens safe started cooperating with icelandic loftleidir , who held the rights to fly to north america via iceland . this involved braathens leasing personnel and aircraft to loftleidir and profit sharing on the route , in an agreement which lasted until 1961 . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 75–83 . domestic operations with herons and fellowships . charter flights to europe using douglas dc-6 aircraft started in 1950 . the airline applied for and was granted permission to fly from oslo via tønsberg airport , jarlsberg to stavanger . braathens acquired de havilland heron aircraft to operate the route . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 64–65 permission to fly from oslo to trondheim airport , lade was granted in 1953 , a route also served by sas . termination of far east routes led to a 90 % drop in revenue and the airline made several unsuccessful applications for new routes . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 66–70 they were successful in obtaining permission include stopovers on oslo–stavanger services at kristiansand airport , kjevik and farsund airport , lista . from 1956 stopovers took place at hamar airport , stafsberg and notodden airport , tuven , but these only lasted until 1959 . by then it had added røros airport to its destinations . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 104–108 following the bankruptcy of west norway airlines in 1957 and the opening of ålesund airport , vigra the following year , concessions were reshuffled , and braathens was granted a monopoly on services to ålesund and between trondheim and bergen , while it and sas would compete on services between oslo and stavanger , kristiansand and trondheim . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 112 braathens safe was the second airline to take delivery of the fokker f-27 friendship . the friendships , which replaced the dc-3 and herons were turboprops with pressurized cabins . the first aircraft was delivered in 1958 and the model was put into service on the main routes . service to hamar , farsund and tønsberg stopped because their runways were too short . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 118–120 braathens started charter flights to longyearbyen in 1959 , landing on an improvised snow runway . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 155–158 scheduled service between oslo via sandefjord airport , torp to aalborg airport in denmark was introduced in 1960 . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 121 in 1967 braathens safe was granted permission to continue their service between bergen , ålesund and trondheim northwards to bodø airport and tromsø airport . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 165–172 saga tours started selling mediterranean charter trips in 1959 and braathens safe operated the flights . at first the dc-4 was used , but from 1961 the airline used the 96-seat douglas dc-6 , reaching seven aircraft in 1967 . braathens bought strategic stakes in both saga tours and sweden 's atlas resor to secure their share of the charter market . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 131–134 multilateral agreements allowed any scandinavian airline to fly charter services from any of the three scandinavian countries to spain ; while this allowed braathens safe to enter the swedish and danish charter market , it increased competition on their home turf . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 134–138 . entering the jet age . braathens safe ordered three boeing 737 jets in 1965 , which were intended to rationalize charter operations . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 167 the shorter -100 model was rejected in favor of becoming the launch customer of the fokker f-28 fellowship , which was planned as the new domestic workhorse . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 243–245 the move would see all the f-27 replaced with f-28 . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 173–178 both jet aircraft were delivered in 1969 . this period also saw the gradual retirement of the dc-4 and dc-6 . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 180–182 kristiansund airport , kvernberget opened in 1970 and molde airport , årø in 1972 , with braathens safe granted permission to operate the routes . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 183 the airline also received permission to operate from bergen via either ålesund , molde or kristiansund to bodø and tromsø . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 186–194 between 1975 and 1977 , the last three f-27 were sold to sister airline busy bee , which took over some of the smallest services . '' green routes '' were introduced from 1976 , which offered discounts on certain flights with strict conditions . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 203–211 founder ludvig g . braathen died on 27 december 1976 , while still acting as chief executive officer ( ceo ) . he was replaced by his son bjørn g . braathen . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 212–213 during the 1970s , braathens safe took delivery of eleven 737s , including one with a cargo door , and three with extended range which allowed for non-stop flights to the canary islands . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 237 discounted '' summer tickets '' were introduced from the early 1980s which increased load factor . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 261–267 braathens safe bought 15 percent of dnl in 1982 and applied for concessions for helicopter services from stavanger to offshore oil platforms . this resulted in the incumbent , helikopter service , applying for all of braathens safe 's western norway routes . neither application was successful . busy bee was contracted in 1984 to connect farsund , haugesund airport , karmøy , bergen and stavanger , as well as operate from sandefjord airport , torp . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 268–277 in an attempt to remain competitive in the charter market from oslo , gothenburg and stockholm , the airline ordered two boeing 767 in 1980 . they were configured with 242 seats , fewer than for most charter airlines , which typically had 273 . the aircraft were delivered in 1984 . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 144–148 launched as '' first business class '' to charter travelers , the business model was unsuccessful as new customer groups had little willingness to pay . the company was faced with not being able to charter out the plane because of the lower number of seats , but could not put in the extra seats because the aircraft were also used for scheduled flights . as a result , the two aircraft were sold in 1986 , and the airline 's swedish charter operations closed in 1988 . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 148–150 the four remaining f-28s were also sold in 1986 , giving braathens safe a unified 737-200 fleet , reducing operating costs . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 364–365 six more 737-200 were delivered in 1986 . tjomsland and wilsberg ( 1995 ) : 274 on 1 june 1989 , erik g . braathen , son of bjørn g . , took over as ceo at the age of 34 . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 305 with the launch of the boeing 737 classic range , braathens took delivery of the 156-seat 737-400 and the 124-seat 737-500 , both featuring glass cockpits . the larger model was mostly used for charter services , while the smaller was mostly used in the domestic market . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 247–249 the first -400 was delivered in 1989 and the first -500 the following year . by 1994 all -200 had been retired . . deregulation . the first stages towards deregulation started in 1987 with braathens safe being permitted to compete with sas on the oslo–bergen and western norway–trondheim–bodø–tromsø route , plus once daily oslo–trondheim–bodø , as well as tromsø–longyearbyen , in an attempt to increase domestic competition . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 291–294 from 1988 , braathens safe was granted a series of international route concessions . the first , to billund , denmark , started in 1989 , and the second , to newcastle , started the following year . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 295–300 a route to malmö , sweden , started in 1991 and on a week 's notice in 1992 , braathens safe started flying to london gatwick airport , after the bankruptcies of norway airlines and dan-air . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 299–304 busy bee went bankrupt in 1993 and their regional services were instead subcontracted to norwegian air shuttle . braathens helikopter was established by braganza in 1989 after negotiating agreements with norsk hydro , phillips petroleum and statoil to provide helicopter transport for their crews to their offshore oil installations ekofisk , oseberg , gullfaks , veslefrikk . this was the first time the incumbent helikopter service had received competition on their offshore helicopter services . four 19-seet aérospatiale super puma helicopters were ordered . services started on 1 september 1990 . in 1992 the helicopter airline signed an agreement to fly for british petroleum to ula and gyda . braathens helikopter and helikopter service announced on 1 october 1993 that the two companies would merge from 1 january 1994 . the deregulation process , which would eliminate the need for concessions for routes , was driven by norway 's application for membership of the european union . since the airline 's conception , braathens safe had been a staunch opponent to the concession system and an avid proponent of free competition in the airline industry . with a deregulation around the corner , the airline change stands and warned against the consequences of a free market . in contrast , sas embraced the new system . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 320–322 braathens safe 's main concern was that their high debt incurred after the purchase of the new aircraft would make them illiquid in a price war . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 327–334 the airline started negotiating airline alliance with larger haulers , but turned both those and a merger proposal with sas down . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 308–317 the norwegian airline market was deregulated on 1 april 1994 , as the third country in europe . both braathens safe and sas had been cross-subsidizing their routes as part of the concession agreements , and braathens safe was losing money on the haugesund–bergen route and flights to røros . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 334–335 a three-year wage agreement was reached with the trade unions to keep costs down , and the company raised additional capital in an initial public offering and subsequent listing on the oslo stock exchange on 10 january 1994 . after the listing , braganza retained 69 % of the company . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 336–339 on 1 april , service frequencies increased on the oslo–bergen route and the airline introduced direct flights from oslo to tromsø and harstad/narvik airport , evenes , later supplemented with direct services to bodø . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 340–341 the following two years , braathens safe also introduced scheduled international flights to rome , as well as summer routes to jersey and nice . however , braathens safe terminated their routes from bergen to bodø , harstad/narvik and tromsø , making the passengers switch planes in trondheim . braathens signed agreements with many of norway 's large companies in 1995 in exchange for large discounts . . safe goes back . the airline bought transwede airways in 1996 , the second-largest domestic airline in sweden . the goal was to integrate the networks , starting on 18 june with a new service between the two capital cities , one of sas ' most profitable . braathens announced in 1997 the order of six 134-seat boeing 737-700 , while transwede started replacing its fokker 100s with 737s . transwede changed its name to braathens sverige later that year . from 1998 braathens safe started a strategic partnership with dutch airline klm , with klm purchasing thirty percent of braathens safe and braathens safe taking over most of klm 's routes between norway and amsterdam . london services were moved to london stansted airport . the klm agreement came as a response to sas founding the star alliance along with among others lufthansa . on 23 march 1998 , braathens safe changed its name and corporate identity to braathens . it introduced a new livery with a blue bottom , and replaced the norwegian flag on the tail with an abstract , silver wing , that became the company 's new logo . at the same time , a two-class configuration was introduced—best and back—with the latter being offered to discounted ticket-holders . sas did not follow the same policy , and offered its discounted customers to travel in the same class as braathens ' , including complimentary service . braathens bought malmö aviation on 17 august 1998 , which operated eleven british aerospace 146 jets between stockholm-bromma airport , göteborg landvetter airport , malmö airport and london city airport . color air was established as a domestic low-cost airline by olav nils sunde in january 1998 . that year also saw the closing of fornebu and the opening of gardermoen as the new main airport , with the move taking place on 8 october . color air started flights from gardermoen on 1 august . as gardermoen did not have the landing slot limitations as the single-runway fornebu , the three airline set off in a craze to establish new routes . in total , the three companies increased their daily round trip from 138 to 200 , and the daily seat capacity from 18,000 to 26,000 . braathens introduced a new route to haugesund , but saw competition from sas to kristiansand and from two airlines to ålesund . by the end of 1998 , it became clear that braathens had increased capacity with 20 percent , but only achieved a 5.2 percent ridership increase after the opening of gardermoen . similar numbers were applicable for sas . in particular , the routes from oslo to ålesund and kristiansand had a very low seat utilization ; to ålesund there were 1.2 million flown seats annually between the three airlines , but only 345,000 passengers . color air terminated all flights and ceased operations on 27 september 1999 . immediately following the bankruptcy , the two airlines increased their prices . in november , braathens started to remove routes , and announced they would increase prices by 20 percent . they also reintroduced the flag of norway on the tail . both braathens and sas lost more than 1 billion norwegian krone ( nok ) in 1999 , totaling the cost of the price war between the three airlines to exceed nok & nbsp ; 3 billion . . fall and merger with sas . arne a . jensen took over as ceo on 23 july 1999 . in february 1999 , braathens merged the swedish division with malmö aviation , to create braathens malmö aviation . at the same time , the airline removed the 'best ' and 'back ' scheme on domestic swedish flights . in november , braathens terminated all services in sweden that were inherited from transwede . the following two years saw a large increase in ticket prices and a decrease of flights . several domestic and international routes were cut in 2001 , but introduced new international services to leisure destinations . the sas group and braathens announced on 21 may 2001 that klm and braganza had agreed to sell their 69 percent stake in braathens for nok & nbsp ; 800 million to sas— putting braathens ' value at nok & nbsp ; 1.1 billion . because the two would hold a near-monopoly on domestic services , the merger was investigated by the norwegian competition authority . they initially disapproved of the merger , with bankruptcy imminent and no other purchasers interested , the authority gave the green light on 23 october . as a condition , the authority decided to regulate a ban on frequent flyer programs , and stated that it would ban cross-subsidization aimed at underbidding or operating at a loss to force new entrants out of the market . sas and braathens split all the routes between them on 2 april 2002 . braathens withdrew from the oslo to trondheim , bergen and stavanger routes , but took over most flights to northern norway . on 24 april 2002 , sas announced that all handling services operated by braathens would be taken over by sas ground services . all sas employees would be prioritized in the rationalization process , and 800 braathens employees were laid off . three hundred braathens ' employees were offered jobs with sas ground services , but these lost their seniority . no employees in sas lost their jobs . the issue ended in the courts , with the supreme court reinstating seniority in 2006 . sas announced on 10 march 2004 that sas and braathens would in may be merged into a single company , sas braathens . the company took over the operating licence of braathens , including the iata and icao code , and callsign . from 1 june 2007 , sas braathens was rebranded to scandinavian airlines , making it identical to the branding in sweden and denmark , although it remains a separate limited company named sas norge as . . fleet . the airline operated 118 aircraft of 15 different models . the airline has operated at least three models each from douglas , fokker and boeing , in addition to the de havilland heron and british aerospace 146 . the airline 's most-operated aircraft is the boeing 737 , of which it had 20 . braathens has operated five variants of the 737 , totaling 64 aircraft . tjomsland & wilsberg ( 1995 ) : 363–364 from the establishment , braathens safe 's aircraft livery had a thick red and thinner white and blue cheatline , with the flag of norway on the vertical stabilizer . tjomsland & wilsberg ( 1995 ) : 37 with only slight modifications , this general design was continued to and including the 737-400 and -500 aircraft . tjomsland & wilsberg ( 1995 ) : 99 a new livery with a stylized grey wing as logo on the vertical stabilizer and a blue belly was introduced in 1998 with the delivery of the 737-700 . the logo was replaced with the flag of norway in 1999 . only some of the early douglas aircraft were named , and those that were started with '' norse '' . the heron were given common norwegian male names . the three last f-27 and newer aircraft were all named for kings of norway . . destinations . during its operations , the airline has served 53 airports serving 50 cities . of these , 25 airports serving 23 cities were in norway and 6 destinations and cities in sweden . braathens had provided international services to 24 airports serving 22 cities in 17 countries . seven of these cities are in asia , the rest in europe . tjomsland : 45 in addition , braathens has served numerous destinations as both regular and ad-hoc charter . braathens safe 's main base was oslo airport , gardermoen from 1946 to 1949 , and then moved its main base to oslo airport , fornebu . from the closing of fornebu in 1998 , it moved back to gardermoen and established it as a hub . from 1997 to 1999 , stockholm-arlanda airport acted as a hub for sweden . the main technical base was at stavanger airport , sola . tjomsland : 48 prior to 1987 tjomsland : 295–304 the norwegian aviation market was split between braathens safe and sas . the two only competed head-on on the routes from oslo to stavanger and trondheim . braathens held a monopoly on the routes from oslo to kristiansand , ålesund , tjomsland : 112 molde and kristiansund , tjomsland : 183–185 as well as the west coast route between bergen , ålesund , molde , kristiansund and trondheim , as well as from western norway to northern norway . tjomsland : 173–178 with the opening of gardermoen in 1998 , braathens had expanded its network to direct services from oslo to kristiansand , stavanger , haugesund , bergen , ålesund , molde , kristiansund , trondheim , bodø , harstad/narvik and tromsø , in addition to a network of direct routes connected many of these airports with each other . in sweden , braahtens operated flights from stockholm to luleå , umeå , sundsvall , jönköping and halmstad . from oslo , international services were provided to malmö , stockholm , billund , newcastle , london , jersey , nice and rome , and from 2000 to barcelona , alicante and málaga . service were flown from several norwegian cities to amsterdam . . service . prior to 1998 , braathens had a one-class service ; the service included a complimentary airline meal and discounted tickets were available with restrictions . starting 23 march 1998 , the airline changed its corporate identity to 'braathens ' and introduced a two-class system onboard its planes . passengers paying full price were seated in the 'best ' category at the front of the plane , making up about 70 percent of the capacity . best customers received complimentary coffee and meals with non-disposable cutlery , free newspapers and a better seat pitch . behind the curtain was the 'back ' category , which had no in-flight meals or newspapers and a smaller pitch . however , a meal with coffee and soft drink could be purchased for nok & nbsp ; 45 . back tickets were sold with a discount , but had to be bought at least seven days before travel , and the traveller had to be away over a weekend . there were also some discounted best tickets , but these never cost as little as the back tickets . the 'best ' and 'back ' service was highly criticized by analysts and customers . braathens safe had a strong image as the people 's airline , in contrast to sas ' business image . braathens also drew goodwill from being norwegian-owned and that it displayed the flag of norway on the tailplane . prior to the rebranding , no airline in norway had ever operated a two-class service on domestic flights . professor of sociology per morten schiefloe commented that the segregation offended passengers : customers who previously had been paying full price , became more aware of the savings on using 'back ' tickets , while people who wanted to travel with discounted tickets felt they received better service and were not treated as second-rate customers with sas . the effect was that braathens lost customers at both ends . the rebranding itself not only cost money to initiate , but also increased operating expenses , because cabin crew needed to move the curtain depending on the number of passengers on each class . planes were sometimes delayed for hours , particularly in the beginning of the service , due to the increased work load on the handling and cabin crew . braathens launched its frequent-flyer program as bracard in 1985 , and rebranded it as wings in 1999 . the membership had three tiers : gold , silver and blue . until 1997 , braathens had agreements with finnair and british airways , where bracard members received miles on the partners flights . after the partnership with klm was introduced , wings-members received miles with klm , northwest airlines , continental airlines and alitalia . . accidents and incidents . on 7 november 1956 , the heron ln-sur lars crashed at hummelfjell after the aircraft had experienced icing problems . the hummelfjell accident killed the pilot and one passenger , but the remaining ten people on board survived . among them was the famous television actor rolf kirkvaag , who , despite injury , succeeded at walking to civilization to inform about the accident . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 111 on 23 december 1972 at 16:30 , the company 's most fatal accident occurred . f-28 ln-suy sverre sigurdson on flight 239 from ålesund to oslo crashed at asker , killing 40 of the 45 people on board , including the crew of three . the cause of the accident was never discovered , although a possibility could have been faults with the instrument landing system . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 198–199 on 21 june 1985 , the 737-200 ln-sug harald gille flight 139 , with 121 passengers en route from trondheim to oslo , was hijacked by the 24-year-old stein arvid huseby . he had threatened a flight attendant with an air gun . he demanded to talk to prime minister kåre willoch and minister of justice mona røkke and a press conference to make a political statement . those demands were not met , and he surrendered after 4.5 hours after he demanded and got a few beers . this was the first hijacking in norway . tjomsland and wilsberg , 1995 : 279 . references . ; bibliography ; notes . external links . official site at the wayback machine
