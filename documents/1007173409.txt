Victorien Sardou

early years . victorien sardou was born at 16 rue beautreillis , paris on 5 september 1831 . the sardous were settled at le cannet , a village near cannes , where they owned an estate , planted with olive trees . a night 's frost killed all the trees and the family was ruined . victorien 's father , antoine léandre sardou , came to paris in search of employment . he was in succession a book-keeper at a commercial establishment , a professor of book-keeping , the head of a provincial school , then a private tutor and a schoolmaster in paris , besides editing grammars , dictionaries and treatises on various subjects . with all these occupations , he hardly succeeded in making a livelihood , and when he retired to his native country , victorien was left on his own resources . he had begun studying medicine , but had to desist for want of funds . he taught french to foreign pupils : he also gave lessons in latin , history and mathematics to students , and wrote articles for cheap encyclopaedias . . career . at the same time , he was trying to make headway in the literary world . his talents had been encouraged by an old , mme de bawl , who had published novels and enjoyed some reputation in the days of the restoration , but she could do little for her protégé . victorien sardou made efforts to attract the attention of mlle rachel , and to win her support by submitting to her a drama , la reine ulfra , founded on an old swedish chronicle . a play of his , la taverne des étudiants , was produced at the odéon on 1 april 1854 , but met a stormy reception , owing to a rumour that the débutant had been instructed and commissioned by the government to insult the students . la taverne was withdrawn after five nights . another drama by sardou , bernard palissy , was accepted at the same theatre , but the arrangement was cancelled in consequence of a change in the management . a canada play , fleur de liane , would have been produced at the ambigu but for the death of the manager . le bossu , which he wrote for charles albert fechter , did not satisfy the actor ; and when the play was successfully produced , the nominal authorship , by some unfortunate arrangement , had been transferred to other men . sardou submitted to adolphe lemoine , manager of the gymnase , a play entitled paris à l'envers , which contained the love scene , afterwards so famous , in nos intimes . lemoine thought fit to consult eugène scribe , who was revolted by the scene in question . in 1857 , sardou felt the pangs of actual want , and his misfortunes culminated in an attack of typhoid fever . he was living in poverty and was dying in his garret , surrounded by his rejected manuscripts . a lady who was living in the same house unexpectedly came to his assistance . her name was mlle de brécourt . she had theatrical connections and was a special favourite of mlle déjazet . she nursed him , cured him , and , when he was well again , introduced him to her friend . déjazet had just established the theatre named after her , and every show after la taverne was put on at this theatre . fortune began to smile on the author . it is true that candide , the first play he wrote for mlle déjazet , was stopped by the censor , but les premières armes de figaro , monsieur garat , and les prés saint gervais , produced almost in succession , had a splendid run . garat and gervais were done at theatre des varlétés and in english at criterion theatre in london . les pattes de mouche ( 1860 , afterwards anglicized as a scrap of paper ) obtained a similar success at the gymnase . fédora ( 1882 ) , a work that popularized the fedora as well , encarta dictionary , microsoft encarta premium suite 2004 . was written expressly for sarah bernhardt , as were many of his later plays . this was later adapted by umberto giordano , and he made an opera entitled fedora . the play dealt with nihilism , which was coined from fathers and sons by ivan turgenev . he struck a new vein by introducing a strong historic element in some of his dramatic romances . thus he borrowed théodora ( 1884 ) from byzantine annals ( which was also adapted into an opera by xavier leroux ) , la haine ( 1874 ) from italian chronicles , la duchesse d'athénes from the forgotten records of medieval greece . patrie ! ( 1869 ) is founded on the rising of the dutch geuzen at the end of the 16th century , and was made into a popular opera by emile paladilhe in 1886 . the scene of la sorcière ( 1904 ) was laid in spain in the 16th century . the french revolution furnished him three plays , les merveilleuses , thermidor ( 1891 ) and robespierre ( 1899 ) . his play gismonda ( 1894 ) was adapted into an opera by henry février . the last named was written expressly for sir henry irving , and produced at the lyceum theatre in london , as was dante ( 1903 ) . the napoleonic era was revived in la tosca ( 1887 ) . madame sans-gêne ( 1893 ) was written specifically for gabrielle réjane as the unreserved , good-hearted wife of marshal lefevre . it was translated into english and starred irving and ellen terry at the lyceum theatre . later plays were la pisie ( 1905 ) and le drame des poisons ( 1907 ) . in many of these plays , however , it was too obvious that a thin varnish of historic learning , acquired for the purpose , had been artificially laid on to cover modern thoughts and feelings . but a few & nbsp ; — patrie ! and la haine ( 1874 ) , for instance & nbsp ; — exhibit a true insight into the strong passions of past ages . l'affaire des poisons ( 1907 ) was running at the théâtre de la porte saint-martin and was very successful at the time of his death . the play involved the poisoning camarilla under louis xiv of france . toward the end of his life , sardou made several recordings of himself reading passages from his works , including a scene from patrie ! .

'' . he also came up with the dismissive term '' sardoodledom '' in a review of sardou plays ( the saturday review , 1 june 1895 ) . shaw believed that sardou 's contrived dramatic machinery was creaky and that his plays were empty of ideas . sardou 's advice to young playwrights on how to be successful was to '' torture the women ! '' as part of any play construction . after producer sir squire bancroft saw the dress rehearsal for fedora , he said in his memoirs '' in five minutes the audience was under a spell which did not once abate throughout the whole four acts . never was treatment of a strange and dangerous subject more masterly , never was acting more superb than sarah showed that day . '' william winter said of fedora that '' the distinguishing characteristic of this drama is carnality . '' sardou is mentioned in chapter two of proust 's the guermantes way , the third volume of in search of lost time . in new orleans , during the period when much of its upper class still spoke french , antoine alciatore , founder of the famous old restaurant antoine 's , invented a dish called eggs sardou in honor of the playwright 's visit to the city . the rue victorien sardou and square victorien sardou near the parc sainte-périne in paris are named after him . there are also streets named rue victorien sardou in lyon and saint-omer . works . stage works . la taverne des étudiants ( 1854 ) les premières armes de figaro ( 1859 ) , with emile vanderbuch les gens nerveux ( 1859 ) , with théodore barrière les pattes de mouche ( a scrap of paper ; 1860 ) monsieur garat ( 1860 ) les femmes fortes ( 1860 ) l'écureuil ( 1861 ) l'homme aux pigeons ( 1861 ) , as jules pélissié onze jours de siège ( 1861 ) piccolino ( 1861 ) , comedy in 3 acts with songs piccolino , comédie en trois actes , 1861 at google books nos intimes !
