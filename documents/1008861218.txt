Recruitment to the British Army during the First World War

august 1914 . at the outbreak of war on 4 august 1914 , the british regular army numbered 247,432 serving officers and other ranks . this did not include reservists liable to be recalled to the colours upon general mobilization or the part-time volunteers of the territorial army . about one-third of the peace-time regulars were stationed in india and were not immediately available for service in europe . for a century british governmental policy and public opinion were against conscription for foreign wars . at the start of world war i the british army consisted of six infantry divisions , one cavalry division in the united kingdom formed after the outbreak of war , and four divisions overseas . fourteen territorial force divisions also existed , and 300,000 soldiers in the reserve army . lord kitchener , the secretary of state for war , considered the territorial force untrained and useless . he believed that the regular army must not be wasted in immediate battle , but instead used to help train a new army with 70 divisions—the size of the french and german armies—that he foresaw would be needed to fight a war lasting many years . . volunteer army , 1914–15 . in 1914 , the british had about 5.5 million men of military age , with another 500,000 reaching the age of 18 each year . peter simkins , kitchener 's army : the raising of the new armies 1914–1916 ( manchester , manchester university press : 1988 the initial call for 100,000 volunteers was far exceeded , almost half a million men enlisted in two months ( see the graph ) . around 250,000 underage boys also volunteered , either by lying about their age or giving false names , these were always rejected if the lie was discovered . one early peculiarity was the formation of 'pals battalions ' : groups of men from the same factory , football team , bank or similar , joining and fighting together . the idea was first suggested at a public meeting by lord derby . within three days , he had enough volunteers for three battalions . lord kitchener gave official approval for the measure almost instantly and the response was impressive . manchester raised nine specific pals battalions ( plus three reserve battalions ) ; one of the smallest was accrington , in lancashire , which raised one . one consequence of pals battalions was that a whole town could lose its military-aged menfolk in a single day of battle . adrian gregory , the last great war ( cambridge , cambridge university press : 2007 ) the women 's suffrage movement was sharply divided , the slight majority becoming very enthusiastic patriots and asking their members to give white feathers ( the sign of the coward ) in the streets to men who appeared to be of military age to shame them into service . after assaults became prevalent the silver war badge was issued to men who were not eligible or had been medically discharged . the popular music hall artistes of the time worked enthusiastically for recruitment . harry lauder toured the music halls , recruiting young soldiers on stage in front of the audience , often offering 'ten pounds for the first recruit tonight ' . marie lloyd sang a recruiting song i did n't like you much before you joined the army , john , but i do like you , cockie , now you 've got yer khaki on ( 1914 ) . vesta tilley sang the army of today 's alright . the available pool was diminished by roughly 1.5 million men who were '' starred '' : kept in essential occupations . almost 40 percent of the volunteers were rejected for medical reasons . malnutrition was widespread in u.k . society ; working class 15‑year‑olds had an average height of 5 feet 2 inches ( 160cm ) while the upper class was 5 feet 6 inches ( 171cm ) floud , r . height , health and history . cambridge university press , 1990 . from the start kitchener insisted that the british must build a massive army for a long war , arguing that the british were obliged to mobilise to the same extent as the french and germans . his goal was 70 divisions and the adjutant general asked for 92,000 recruits per month , well above the number volunteering ( see the graph ) . the obvious remedy was conscription , which was a hotly debated political issue . many liberals , including prime minister h . h . asquith , were ideologically opposed to compulsion , but by 1915 they were wavering . 15 july 1915 the national registration act was passed by the british government , exactly one month later there was a census of every citizen aged 15 to 65 , approximately 29 million forms completed . a pink coloured registration card was issued to each registree , listing pertinent data . beckett , i . f . w .

'' the great war , 1914–1918 : the illustrated journal of first world war history , 2 ( 1988 ) : 4–13 . these records were ordered to be destroyed in 1921 , yet fortunately some did survive , including the recently discovered forms of 2,409 women living in cirencester , now transcribed and made publicly available . the cabinet were given a strong warning in september 1915 in a paper presented by their only labour member , minister of education arthur henderson . national archives , cab/37/134/5 . he argued many working men would strongly resist serving a nation in which they did not have a legitimate share in governing . they resented the idea of being dragooned to face possible death by a parliament they had no part in electing—forty percent of men over 21 were denied the vote by the franchise and registration laws ( until the representation of the people act 1918 ) . to them conscription was yet another theft of working men 's rights by rich capitalists . the only counter-argument the government could offer was it was of absolute necessity . workers must be convinced that there were too few volunteers to meet the need , meaning the loss of the war and the end of britain ! ; army leaders should convince union leaders by stating military facts . henderson 's own son was killed in the war a year later . . the derby scheme . left the derby scheme was launched in autumn 1915 by the earl of derby , kitchener 's new director general of recruiting , to determine how many new recruits could be signed up , using appointed canvassers visiting eligible men at home to persuade them to 'volunteer ' for war service . '' recruiting supplement '' times ( london ) special supplement , 3 november 1915 . the scheme announcement caused an initial rise in recruitment , as some preferred to go to the recruiting office rather than wait for the inevitable . the process began with each eligible man ’ s registry card , from the august 1915 national registry , being copied onto another card which was sent to his local constituency 's parliamentary recruiting committee . this committee appointed 'canvassers ' who they considered '' tactful and influential men '' , and not themselves liable for service , to visit the men in their homes . many canvassers were experienced in politics , though discharged veterans and the fathers of serving soldiers proved the most effective , while some just used threats to persuade . although women were not allowed to canvas , they did contribute by tracking men who had moved address . manchester guardian october and november 1915 . every man would be given a copy of a letter from the earl of derby , explaining the programme and , rather dramatically , stating that they were in '' a country fighting , as ours is , for its very existence '' . times ( london ) special supplement , 3 november 1915 p . 3 . and had to state whether or not he was willing to attest to enlist . those who did agree to attest had to promise to present themselves at their recruiting office within 48 hours , while some were accompanied there immediately . if found they passed a medical they were sworn in and paid a 'signing bonus ' of 2s 9d . the next day they were transferred to army reserve b . a khaki armband bearing the royal crown was provided to all who had enlisted , or officially rejected , as well as to starred and discharged men . ( this ceased once conscription was introduced , jan.1916 ) . the enlistee ’ s data was copied onto another card and used to assign him to one of 46 married or unmarried age groups , and promised that only entire groups would be called for active service , after 14 days prior notice . single men 's groups would be called before married , any who wed after the day the scheme began were still classified as single . married men were assured their group would not be called if too few single men attested - unless conscription was introduced . the scheme was undertaken during november - december 1915 and obtained 318,553 medically fit single men . national archives , cab 37/140/1 . however , 38 % of single men and 54 % of married men had resisted the orchestrated pressure to enlist in the war , so the british government , determined to ensure a supply of replacements for mounting casualties overseas , instead passed the military service act of compulsory conscription , 27 january 1916 . . conscription 1916–1918 . as there were too few volunteers to fill the ranks , the military service bill was introduced in january 1916 ; compulsory conscription for the first time in britain 's history . every unmarried man and childless widower between 18 and 41 was offered three choices : enlist at once . attest at once under derby ’ s system . or on 2 march 1916 be automatically deemed to have enlisted . in may 1916 the bill was extended to married men and in april 1918 the upper age was raised to 50 ( or 56 if need arose ) . ireland was excluded due to the 1916 easter uprising , yet many irish men still volunteered to enlist . one of the immediate effects of conscription was the biggest protest demonstration britain had seen since the 1914 anti-war protests . marched from london ’ s east end to trafalgar square , where they listened to speeches from sylvia pankhurst and a glasgow councillor who reported that engineers had come out on strike along the clyde . the event ended in violence when a group of soldiers and sailors charged the crowd , ripped their banners and threw dye in their faces . some of the assailants were arrested , but bow street magistrates let them off with nominal fines and a warning to “ leave these idiots alone in future ” . as arthur henderson had warned , compulsion was unpopular , by july 1916 , 93,000 ( 30 % ) of those called up for military service had failed to appear ( in reality they had little chance of escape , although a lucky few were hidden by sympathisers ) rippon , n . the plot to kill lloyd george : the story of alice wheeldon and the pear tree conspiracy . barnsley : wharncliffe books , 2009 . and 748,587 had claimed an exemption - the men , or their employers , could appeal to a civilian military service tribunal in their district on the grounds of work of national importance , business or domestic hardship , medical unfitness or conscientious objection . j.e . edmonds , military operations : france and belgium : 1916 , vol . i ( london : 1932 ) , p.152 . dealing with these cases filled the judicial courts , although the standards of appeal tribunals were dubious : in york a case was determined in an average of eleven minutes , while two minutes was typical at paddington , london . beckett , 1988 , p.7 . in addition to those objecting to enlisting , there were 1,433,827 already starred as being in a war occupation , ill or already discharged from service due to illness ; the enforced conscription act ultimately failed to satisfy govt demand for lives . although it has been the focus of the tribunals ' image since the war , only two percent of those appealing were conscientious objectors . around 7,000 of them were granted non-combatant duties , while a further 3,000 ended up in special work camps . 6,000 were imprisoned . forty two were sent to france to potentially face a firing squad . thirty five were formally sentenced to death , but immediately reprieved , with ten years penal servitude substituted . many of those appealing were given some kind of exemption , usually temporary ( between a few weeks and six months ) or conditional on their situation at work or home remaining serious enough to warrant their staying at home . in october 1916 1.12 million men held tribunal exemption or had cases pending , the national archives , cab 17/158 , derby scheme : statement of the war committee , 24 october 1916 by may 1917 this had fallen to 780,000 exempt and 110,000 pending . at this point 1.8 million men were exempted , more men than were serving overseas with the british army . statistics of the military effort of the british empire during the great war . 1914–1920 ( london : 1922 ) . some men were exempted on the condition that they joined the volunteer training corps for part-time training and home defence duties ; by february 1918 , 101,000 men had been directed to the corps by the tribunals . a newspaper report on 17 february 1916 listed five sample appeals for exemption from conscription , and their results . daily telegraph thursday 17 february 1916 , reprinted in daily telegraph wednesday 17 february 2016 page 26 in 1917 the commons passed a bill to give the vote to all males over 21 ( and to many women as well ) , but it did not become law until 6 february 1918 . in the same month occupational exemptions were withdrawn for men 18 to 23 , in october 1918 there were 2,574,860 men in reserved occupations . men aged 18½ were sent to the fronts starting in march 1918 , violating a pledge to keep them safe until 19 . there were also problems with men ’ s suitability for active service . the healthy manpower was simply not there – recruits were sorted into three classes , a , b , and c , in order of fitness for front-line service . in 1918 , 75 percent were classed as a , some b men also had to be sent into the trenches . the upper limit on the number of men conscripted is usually calculated by assuming that all recruits after 1 march 1916 were conscripts : 1,542,807 men , 43.7 % of those who served in the army during the war . however , derby had enlisted 318,553 single men in special reserve b , who were called up in spring 1916 , which reduces the conscripted to 37 % . the married men who had attested in the derby plan are harder to categorize because they were not called up from the reserve but swept up with the rest . it seems that somewhat less than 35 % of the men in the army were compelled to serve . ireland . in 1918 , legislation intended to extend conscription to ireland was opposed by a broad movement of irish nationalists and the catholic church in ireland . the central role of sinn féin in this movement boosted its popularity in the buildup to the november general election . advertising for recruitment . official advertising for recruits was in the control of the parliamentary recruiting committee ( prc ) , but private efforts such as that by the london opinion with the now iconic image of kitchener were also produced . posters were prepared in different sizes according to where they would be used ; two sizes and were common . the prc was formed of the prime minister and heads of political parties later joined by other representatives such as for the trades union congress ; its sub-committees handled the preparation and publishing of recruiting materials . over the course of the war the prc was responsible for 164 poster designs and 65 pamphlets . between those and other advertising materials a total of over 54 million pieces were produced at a cost of £40,000 . according to numbers of posters produced , the most popular official prc posters were : '' lord kitchener '' , 1915 . posters no . 113 and 117 , 145,000 copies '' remember belgium '' , 1914-1915 . prc16 and prc 19 , a british soldier on guard while a woman flees her burning home . 140,000 copies '' take up the sword of justice '' , september 1915 prc 105 , 106 , 11 . by bernard partridge featuring the sinking of the lusitania in the background with a figure offering a sword , 105,000 copies '' serve the guns '' may 1915 . prc 85a , 85b , 85c . soldier and munitions worker shaking hands . 101,000 copies '' he did his duty . will you do yours '' . december 1914 . prc 20 . portrait of lord roberts with his victoria cross . 95,000 copies . the '' king 's message '' reprinted in poster form ran to 290,000 copies . taylor . chapter two : weapons of mass persuasion .
