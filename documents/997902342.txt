Mezzotint

history . the mezzotint printmaking method was invented by the german amateur artist ludwig von siegen ( 1609– . his earliest mezzotint print dates to 1642 and is a portrait of countess amalie elisabeth of hanau-münzenberg . this was made by working from light to dark . the rocker seems to have been invented by prince rupert of the rhine , a famous cavalry commander in the english civil war , who was the next to use the process , and took it to england . sir peter lely saw the potential for using it to publicise his portraits , and encouraged a number of dutch printmakers to come to england . godfrey kneller worked closely with john smith , who is said to have lived in his house for a period ; he created about 500 mezzotints , some 300 copies of portrait paintings . british mezzotint collecting was a great craze from about 1760 to the great crash of 1929 , also spreading to america . the main area of collecting was british portraits ; hit oil paintings from the royal academy summer exhibition were routinely , and profitably , reproduced in mezzotint throughout this period , and other mezzotinters reproduced older portraits of historical figures , or if necessary , made them up . the favourite period to collect was roughly from 1750 to 1820 , the great period of the british portrait . there were two basic styles of collection : some concentrated on making a complete collection of material within a certain scope , while others aimed at perfect condition and quality ( which declines in mezzotints after a relatively small number of impressions are taken from a plate ) , and in collecting the many '' proof states '' which artists and printers had obligingly provided for them from early on . leading collectors included william eaton , 2nd baron cheylesmore and the irishman john chaloner smith . griffiths , 134–137 and 141–142 . light to dark method . image:6409 bassenge2vaillerant.jpg thumb left early mezzotint by wallerant vaillant , siegen 's assistant or tutor . young man reading , with statue of cupid . probably made using light to dark technique . the first mezzotints by ludwig von siegen were made using the light to dark method . the metal plate was tooled to create indentations and parts of the image that were to stay light in tone were kept smooth . this method was referred to as the ‘ additive method ’ ; that is , adding areas of indentations to the plate for the areas of the print that were to appear darker in tone . this technique meant that is was possible to create the image directly by only roughening a blank plate selectively , where the darker parts of the image are to be . by varying the degree of smoothing , mid-tones between black and white can be created , hence the name mezzo-tinto which is italian for '' half-tone '' or '' half-painted '' . dark to light method . this became the most common method . the whole surface ( usually ) of a metal , usually copper , plate is roughened evenly , manually with a rocker , or mechanically . if the plate were printed at this point it would show as solid black . the image is then created by selectively burnishing areas of the surface of the metal plate with metal tools ; the smoothed parts will print lighter than those areas not smoothed by the burnishing tool . areas smoothed completely flat will not hold ink at all ; such areas will print '' white , '' that is , the color of the paper without ink . this is called working from '' dark to light '' , or the '' subtractive '' method . jacob christoph le blon used the dark to light method and invented the three and four-color mezzotint printing technique by using a separate metal plate for each color . le blon 's color printing method applied the ryb color model approach whereby red , yellow and blue were used to create a larger gamut of color nuances . in coloritto , le blon refers to red , yellow and blue as 'primitive ' colors and that red and yellow make orange ; red and blue , make purple/violet ; and blue and yellow make green ( le blon , 1725 , p6 ) . printing . printing the finished plate is the same for either method , and follows the normal way for an intaglio plate ; the whole surface is inked , the ink is then wiped off the surface to leave ink only in the pits of the still rough areas below the original surface of the plate . the plate is put through a high-pressure printing press next to a sheet of paper , and the process repeated . because the pits in the plate are not deep , only a small number of top-quality impressions ( copies ) can be printed before the quality of the tone starts to degrade as the pressure of the press begins to smooth them out . perhaps only one or two hundred really good impressions can be taken . detailed technique . plates can be mechanically roughened ; one way is to rub fine metal filings over the surface with a piece of glass ; the finer the filings , the smaller the grain of the surface . special roughening tools called 'rockers ' have been in use since at least the eighteenth century . the method commonly in use today is to use a steel rocker approximately five inches wide , which has between 45 and 120 teeth per inch on the face of a blade in the shape of a shallow arc , with a wooden handle projecting upwards in a t-shape . rocked steadily from side to side at the correct angle , the rocker will proceed forward creating burrs in the surface of the copper . the plate is then moved – either rotated by a set number of degrees or through 90 degrees according to preference – and then rocked in another pass . this is repeated until the plate is roughened evenly and will print a completely solid tone of black . tone . mezzotint is known for the luxurious quality of its tones : first , because an evenly , finely roughened surface holds a lot of ink , allowing deep solid colors to be printed ; secondly because the process of smoothing the plate with burin , burnisher and scraper allows fine gradations in tone to be developed . the scraper is a triangular ended tool , and the burnisher has a smooth round end – not unlike many spoon handles . file : mezzaluna berceau.jpg two sizes of rocker file : mezzotintoführung.jpg using the rocker file : muscles of the sole of the foot . colour mezzotint by a . e . g wellcome v0007806.jpg muscles of the sole of the foot , colour mezzotint by a.e . gautier d'agoty ( son of jacques fabien gautier d'agoty , 1773 file : peter ilsted - sunshine falling on a door.jpg sunshine v , peter ilsted . mezzotint engravers . ludwig von siegen – inventor prince rupert of the rhine wallerant vaillant ( 1623 – 1677 , the first professional mezzotinter ) john smith ( c . 1652 – c . 1742 ) jan van der vaart ( c . 1650 - 1727 , dutchman working in england ) jacob christoph le blon ( 1667 – 1741 , german , developed colour printing , using different plates ) bernhard vogel ( 1683–1737 ) george white ( c . 1684–1732 ) jacques fabien gautier d'agoty ( 1716–1785 , french , developed a four-colour mezzotint process ) richard houston ( 1721 ? –1775 ) james macardell ( 1729 ? –1765 , irish ) edward fisher ( 1730 ? - 1785 ? , irish ) johann jacob ridinger ( 1736–1784 ) , youngest son of johann elias ridinger , who worked in mezzotint himself , too david martin ( 1737 – 1797 , scottish ) william pether ( c . 1738 – 1821 ) valentine green ( 1739 – 1813 ) john dixon ( about 1740–1811 ) richard earlom ( 1743 – 1822 ) william dickinson ( 1746-1823 ) john raphael smith ( 1751 – 1812 ) john jones ( c.1755 – 1797 ) joseph grozer ( 1755 - 1799 ) john young ( 1755 – 1825 ) william doughty ( 1757 - 1782 ) james walker ( c.1760 – c.1823 , british , moved to russia ) charles howard hodges ( 1764 – 1837 , english , moved to amsterdam ) william say ( 1764 - 1834 ) charles turner ( 1774 - 1857 ) john martin ( 1789 – 1854 ) john sartain ( 1808 – 1897 , english pioneer of the technique in america ) alexander hay ritchie ( 1822 – 1895 , scottish , moved to us ) richard josey ( 1840 – 1906 ) , engraver of james mcneill whistler whistler 's mother yozo hamaguchi , ( 1909 – 2000 ) peter ilsted ( 1861 – 1933 , danish ) t.f . simon ( 1877 – 1942 ) m . c . escher ( 1898 – 1972 ) mario avati , ( 1921 – 2009 ) robert kipniss , born 1931 toru iwaya , born 1936 carol wax , born 1953 . notes . references . this includes a detailed description of mezzotint history and methods . antony griffiths ( ed ) , landmarks in print collecting - connoisseurs and donors at the british museum since 1753 , p . & nbsp ;
