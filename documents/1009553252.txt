Jandek

music . jandek 's first album , ready for the house , though obviously a solo work , was originally credited to a band called the units . as explained in an interview in the first issue of spin , smith was forced to change the name the units by an identically named californian group already in possession of a trademark on the name , after scott ryser from the units wrote smith a letter with documentation . all reissues of this first album and all subsequent corwood releases have been credited to '' jandek '' . in trubee 's interview , smith claims he came up with the name jandek while on the telephone with a person named decker during the month of january . smith 's initial use of a plural band name ( and corwood 's curious tendency to refer to as '' a representative from corwood industries '' ) has led some fans to suggest that the reclusive artist intended his oeuvre to be perceived as the work of an anonymous collective rather than that of a single man . indeed , though roughly two-thirds of his records are solo affairs , the other third have variably featured female vocalists , different male vocalists , bass guitar , electric guitar , drums , and accordion . these contributions are usually credited to outside collaborators , but in the spin interview as well as a letter to dj irwin chusid the artist admitted to having overdubbed parts himself on occasion , such as on the album the rocks crumble . no proper credits list has ever appeared on an album , but song titles have included '' nancy sings '' and '' john plays drums '' , though those pieces are two different versions of the same song . one early theory suggested that all the music was recorded in a single , feverish , possibly manic phase and that after 19 albums the releases would stop . this appeared , at the time , as if it might have some validity – the 21st album , lost cause , finished with a sidelong piece called '' the electric end '' , a crazed instrumental featuring shouted vocals , electric guitar , and microphone feedback . instead , this seems to have marked the end of the '' first band phase . '' then the 22nd album arrived and returned to the acoustic and vocal sound that is found on most of the first six corwood albums ( often referred to as '' the first acoustic phase '' ) . this continued unabated for seven albums until , in 1999 , the beginning was released , which ended with a fifteen-minute-long work of instrumental piano . this ushered in the most controversial period of albums in corwood 's history – three albums of unaccompanied voice . seemingly recorded on a voice-activated tape recorder , these '' spoken word songs '' ran up to half an hour in length and taxed even the most devoted followers . after these albums , though , the direction changed again and jandek returned to a voice and guitar mixture with occasional harmonica , though the approach was different than the earlier recordings . the guitar was often electric and the voice was decidedly older than that on the previous albums . further albums have continued the solo approach , though the instrument used has occasionally been a fretless bass , and the songs have stretched progressively longer and the lyrics have become even more personal . though corwood still releases albums like this ( the most recent is what was out there disappeared ) , they are now alternated with releases of the live band shows , which are remarkably different and feature unusually tight playing . in the 1980s and 1990s most fans stumbled into the world of jandek after hearing his music on college radio or freeform stations like wfmu and wcbn-fm . but as the 21st century approached jandek was just as likely to catch fans through the internet . an '' unofficial jandek website '' was founded by seth tisue in 1997 . it includes complete descriptions of each album and concert and the archives of the jandek discussion list . in the media . the rep unknowingly gave two unauthorized phone interviews in his entire career , the first conducted by fellow outsider artist john trubee , for the aforementioned spin article in 1985 . in it , he admitted to having had musical training earlier in life , and refuted an op magazine reviewer praising '' may he never tune his guitar ! '' by stating that he did indeed tune his guitar , albeit usually to open tunings of his own devising . the spin article was jandek 's first major press ; as the '80s drew to a close , the magazine proclaimed him to be one of the most important artists of the 1980s in a special end-of-decade issue . outsider music expert irwin chusid conducted the second interview and brought quite a bit of attention to jandek by including an account of his own dealings with corwood industries in his book songs in the key of z , the accompanying album featuring a track from ready for the house after jandek called him in response to chusid 's request for information . texas monthly reporter katy vine tracked down the '' corwood representative '' and gave an account of her experiences in the august 1999 issue . at jandek 's request vine kept his name and address a secret . in 2004 unicorn stencil productions released the first documentary on jandek , entitled jandek on corwood . it was directed by chad freidrichs , and produced by freidrichs and paul fehler . amongst the extras on the dvd release of the documentary is the entire unedited tape of the john trubee-conducted spin interview . no one from corwood industries is represented on screen , but the label did suggest several people to be interviewed for the movie , including music critics phil milstein and gary pig gold , and katy vine . corwood 's recommendation of vine for the documentary is seen as essentially endorsing the contents and confirming the authenticity of the texas monthly interview . in october of the same year jandek stunned the alternative music scene by playing live for what was probably the first time ( see live performances section below for details ) . in september 2006 , author danen jobe announced the completion and publication of the first part of his corwood-sanctioned novel niagara blues , released through scottish publishers single cell press . the book , representing jobe 's imagination of a possible biography of the artist , is almost entirely fictional ; its protagonist shares with jandek only his stage name , song catalog , and a few other facts . british publishers halfcut publications announced they would be releasing the complete version of the book in july 2011 . there have been a handful of live shows each year since 2004 , and corwood intends to release all of them on cd in addition to its studio albums . in fact , corwood puts out more jandek releases now than ever in its history , releasing five albums in 2005 alone . summer 2006 saw the release of the first corwood dvd , a video version of glasgow sunday , jandek 's first live performance . duality of self , a record of jandek 's performance in toronto in september 2006 was premiered at the sxsw music festival and film festival in march 2007 . produced by colin brunton , jim mauro , gary topp and '' the representative from corwood '' , the two-hour concert film was directed by brunton and editor ryan noth , using a five camera set up . '' kooken '' , a one-act play featuring jandek ( the representative and sheila smith ) , aired on a pbs program called hardly sound in november 2014 . it was filmed live in august 2014 . live performances . the mystery of jandek 's identity was partially resolved in october 2004 when he performed live at the instal 04 music festival in glasgow , scotland . this was jandek 's first known live appearance and he performed with richard youngs ( bass ) and alex neilson ( drums ) . the man on stage was obviously the same man who appears on the album covers . per corwood 's stipulations , the performance was not publicized in advance , nor was it identified as it happened or at any point afterwards . this performance , and all the subsequent performances up to the all tomorrow 's parties one , seem to have been initiated and organised by barry esson , whose company arika stages music festivals in scotland , including instal and music lovers ' field companion . david tibet of current 93 , who had headlined the festival the previous day , advised fans not only that none of the other artists knew of the performance but also that the word '' jandek '' was never used , the man who performed alongside youngs and neilson being identified only as '' a representative of corwood industries '' ( the full text of tibet 's messages to the jandek mailing list can be read at seth tisue 's website , linked below ) . in may 2005 , however , jandek made appearances at the music lovers ’ field companion festival in gateshead , england , and at the centre for contemporary arts in glasgow , scotland , again with youngs and neilson . the gateshead performance was another guitar/bass/drums trio similar to the performance as instal '04 while the glasgow show found jandek playing piano with youngs on bowed contrabass and neilson on percussion . it later transpired that , as rumored at the time , this performance was a single song in many parts titled '' the cell '' . it lasted around 90 minutes and has been described as lacking the dissonance often associated with jandek , instead being gentle and melodic with many of the piano parts resembling erik satie . these first shows have since been released as glasgow sunday , newcastle sunday , and glasgow monday . on august 28 , 2005 he performed in austin , texas ( as scheduled ) at the scottish rite theatre and temple to a sold-out audience . it was notably his first time ever to appear on stage in the united states , and he performed with sara hennies ( drums ) , chris cogburn ( drums ) , and juan garcia ( bass )

two sets in one night in bristol and making a low-key , short notice return to glasgow . a further london show was canceled without explanation . jandek performed twice in september 2006 . the first show , in toronto , was performed at centre of gravity , a renovated vaudeville theatre/circus rehearsal space and continued the semi-classical/jazzy aspects of glasgow monday , this time using a unique lineup of cymbals , double bass and a guitar played more for sound patterns than melody . the artist himself played the korg keyboards again ( as he had in manhattan ) , and the performance was one extended piece . by contrast , three days later he played a high-amped rock set at the empty bottle in chicago with bassist josh abrams and tortoise drummer/producer john mcentire that featured lyrics recounting a prison stay . jandek played a show in seattle , washington at on the boards on october 27 , 2006 with the same lineup as the portland performance earlier that year , and he ended 2006 with a concert in indianapolis on december 9 , 2006 in a church sanctuary attached to the harrison center for the arts . that show included nathan vollmar of the band rivulets on drums , and a female vocalist who also played viola and sang lead on a few tracks and a flute player , a first . reeds were experimented with more in atlanta and richmond , virginia . at the former , he returned to piano , but was backed by violin , percussion and bass clarinet . at one point the group played a lengthy free-jazz song , with the corwood representative attacking the piano before slowing down , performing a song , and then returning to the free jazz . richmond returned to a bluesier sound , but added saxophone . there were also ( intentional ) props at this show representing a living room
