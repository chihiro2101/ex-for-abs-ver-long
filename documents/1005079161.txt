Francis Asbury

biography . childhood and adolescence . francis asbury was born at hamstead bridge , staffordshire , england on august 20 or 21 , 1745 , to elizabeth and joseph asbury . the family moved to a cottage at great barr , sandwell , the next year . his boyhood home still stands and is open as bishop asbury cottage museum . soon after the family moved to great barr , in may 1748 , asbury 's older sister , sarah , died ; he was less than three years old . asbury wrote later that his mother eliza was '' very much a woman of the world '' ; with his sister 's death , she '' sank into deep distress.from which she was not relieved for many years , '' and was living '' in a very , dark , dark , dark , day and place '' . a few years later she found a renewed christian faith as itinerant preachers , either baptist or methodists , visited barr on a revival circuit . from then on she began to read the bible every day and encouraged her son to do so as well . hallam , david j.a . , eliza asbury : her cottage and her son , studley , 2003 , pp . 8-9 eliza 's deep faith may not have been shared by her husband , who seemed to have problems , possibly drink or gambling . francis asbury described his father as '' industrious . '' the husband supported his wife in her faith and witness : he allowed methodist meetings to be held each sunday in the cottage . hallam ( 2003 ) , eliza asbury , p 13 during asbury 's childhood the west midlands was undergoing massive changes as the industrial revolution swept through the area . waves of workers migrated into the area , attracted by jobs in the growing factories and workshops in birmingham and the black country of the mines . the asburys lived in a cottage tied to a public house , on a main route between the mines and the factories . they would have been aware of the drinking , gambling , poverty and poor behaviour prevalent in the area . hallam ( 2003 ) , eliza asbury , pp 16-20 francis asbury attended a local endowed school in snail 's green , a nearby hamlet . he did not get on well with his fellow pupils who ridiculed him because of his mother 's religious beliefs . during the 1740s there had been widespread anti-methodist rioting in wednesbury and the surrounding area , and into the 1750s a great deal of persecution . nor did he like his teacher and left school at the first opportunity . hallam ( 2003 ) , eliza asbury , pp . 9 and 21 asbury took a keen interest in religion , having '' felt something of god as early as the age of seven '' . hallam ( 2003 ) , p 40 he lived not far from all saint 's church , bromwich , which under the patronage of the methodist earl of dartmouth , provided a living for evangelical minister edward stillinghurst . well connected , stillinghurst invited as visiting preachers some of the foremost preachers and theologians of the day . these included john fletcher , john ryland , henry venn , john cennick and benjamin ingham . his mother encouraged francis to meet with the methodists in wednesbury , eventually joining a '' band '' with four other young men who would meet and pray together . for them a typical sunday would be a preaching meeting at 5.00 am , communion at the parish church mid morning , and attending a preaching meeting again at 5.00 pm . hallam ( 2003 ) , pp 22-25 asbury had his first formal job at age thirteen ; he went '' into service '' for local gentry , whom he later described as '' one of the most ungodly families in the parish '' . but he soon left them and is believed to have eventually worked for thomas foxall , at the old forge farm , old forge farm where he made metal goods . he became great friends with foxall 's son , henry . henry they developed a friendship , which continued after henry foxall 's emigration to colonial america . there he continued working with metal and established the foundry church in georgetown , now part of washington , d.c . asbury began to preach locally , and eventually became an itinerant preacher on behalf of the methodist cause . hallam ( 2003 ) , p42 . asbury 's childhood , and especially his mother 's attitudes , have been the subject of some controversy . in 1927 herbert asbury , a journalist who claimed to be a relative of frances asbury , published a methodist saint : the life of bishop asbury , ( new york : alfred a . knopf , inc . ) . herbert asbury made a number of claims , quoting 'family legend ' about the asbury family , including one that francis 's mother prayed for him to become archbishop of canterbury , that elizabeth claimed to have been visited by angels , and that joseph asbury had previously been married to a susan whipple , a farmer 's daughter from wednesbury . extensive research by local historian david hallam could find no evidence to support herbert asbury 's claims , and dismissed his claiming relation to francis . he noted that asbury was a common surname in the west midlands at the time . see hallam ( 2003 ) , pp . 14-15 . hallam dismisses a similar claim made by a '' genealogical study '' presented by an asbury family to the love lane methodist museum in baltimore . francis asbury was the only surviving child of joseph and elizabeth ; he never married . birth records during this period in england were of poor quality and claims of any relationship are conjecture . asbury 's preaching ministry in england is detailed in the section below : '' asbury 's circuits in england '' . asbury 's work in america . at the age of 22 , asbury 's ordination by john wesley as a traveling preacher became official . typically such positions were held by young , unmarried men , known as exhorters . in 1771 asbury volunteered to travel to thirteen colonies . his first sermon in the colonies took place with the methodist congregation in woodrow , staten island . morris , ira . k . '' early history of staten island '' , proceedings of the new york state historical association , volume 17 , page 198 within the first 17 days of being in the colonies , asbury preached in both philadelphia and new york . during the first year , he served as wesley 's assistant and preached in 25 different settlements . when the american revolutionary war broke out in 1776 , he and james dempster were the only british methodist ministers to remain in america . '' the story of barratt 's chapel , '' accessed 11 september 2015 '' during his early years in north america , asbury devoted his attention mainly to followers living on the eastern shore between the delaware river and the chesapeake bay . bishop asbury was a good friend of the melsons and was their guest many times on his rounds . when the american revolution severed the traditional ties between the american thirteen colonies and great britain , bishop asbury , in the interest of his religious tenets and principles and in an attempt to remain aloof from the political and military fervor that swept the country , announced he would , to keep the embryonic methodist congregations neutral , refrain from endorsing either great britain or the newly formed united states of america government and urged all his followers to do the same . this request placed almost all of his followers , especially those living in maryland , in an untenable position . the state of maryland had enacted a law requiring all citizens to take an oath of allegiance to the newly formed american congress . it addition to this , it stipulated all non-residents within its boundaries also had to take and sign an oath of allegiance . those refusing were summarily incarcerated for treason . asbury , after proclaiming his neutrality , fled to delaware , where taking an oath of allegiance was not a requirement . his adherents in maryland suffered the rancor of the proponents of the oath . '' '' ryan melson '' , melson family in america asbury remained hidden during the war and ventured occasionally back into maryland . sometimes this had the effect of compromising his parishioners . in 1780 , asbury met the freedman harry hosier , a meeting the minister believed '' providentially arranged '' . hosier served as his driver and guide and , though illiterate , memorized long passages of the bible as asbury read them aloud during their travels . hosier eventually became a famous preacher in his own right , the first african american to preach directly to a white congregation in the united states . smith , jessie c . black firsts : 4,000 ground-breaking and pioneering historical events ( 3rd ed . ) , pp . 1820â€“1821 .

'' francis asbury circuits in england '' , the asbury triptych series john wigger provide some details in american saint , his biography on asbury . wigger , john . american saint around 1763 , before this , asbury began leading the class of about two dozen faithful at the west bromwich wesleyan society . in march 1765 , his mentor , wesleyan alexander mather asked asbury to assist him . for the next 11 months , the twenty-year-old asbury taught and preached around the staffordshire circuit . the circuit consisted of small wesleyan societies in west bromwich , wednesbury , walsall , wolverhampton , and billbrook . these areas were the foundation of methodism in the black country . during this initial phase of his circuits around england , two wesleyan preachers offered the majority of the young preachers mentoring . the first was the already mentioned scottish itinerant , mather . the second was an english preacher from bedfordshire , james glasbrook . these two taught asbury , john wesley 's basic requirements for a wesleyan itinerant preacher . in january 1766 , mather offered him the opportunity to quit the forge and join the wesleyan movement as a full-time itinerant on a trial basis . the twenty-one-year-old asbury accepted . part of his training as a full-time traveling preacher required that he read extensively from books suggested by wesley , who made them available in london , bristol and newcastle . the list included several divinity books : the bible , wesley 's tracts , the works of boehm and francke . there were also books on natural philosophy , astronomy , history , poetry and latin prose . there were also books on latin verse , greek prose , including the greek new testament , greek verse - including homer 's iliad , and the hebrew bible . for the next five months , during his circuits in england asbury teamed with william orpe , a young preacher who was the hebrew teacher at wesley 's kingswood school in bristol . they covered the large staffordshire circuit that encompassed not only birmingham , wolverhampton , willenhall , walsall , wednesbury , darlaston and billbrook , but also an extended portion to the south in worcestershire , tewkesbury and gloucestershire . despite his happiness with his new career , asbury struggled with a sense that his efforts were somewhat limited . he was still living with his parents , he was preaching in places that had heard him preach for the last five years . he looked for more travel and more responsibility . asbury pressed mather to assign asbury to the low round of the staffordshire circuit , and found it more grueling than he had anticipated . after twelve months mather sent him home for a short break . asbury then received instructions to head for london . the london conference of 1767 assigned asbury to the bedfordshire circuit . in london , it is likely that asbury met george whitefield when he attended worship at whitefield 's tabernacle . at the time of asbury 's arrival in london , benjamin franklin was staying in london and a guest of his friend whitefield , whom he had met years earlier during one of whitefield 's trips to america . along with franklin at whitefield 's home were connecticut colonial leaders including a mohegan indian named samson occum and his traveling companion , princeton college presbyterian minister , nathaniel whitaker , lord dartmouth , and the merchant dennis de bert . occum and whitaker were in england to raise money for their indian charity school in lebanon , connecticut . spending a couple months in london before the august conference , it is likely that asbury not only heard samson occum speak at the tabernacle , but also had opportunity to meet this unique group . august 18 , 1767 the conference in london began at john and charles wesley 's foundry church . at this conference , wesley assigned asbury to the sprawling bedfordshire circuit . in addition to bedfordshire , asbury was officially admitted on trial and teamed with bedfordshire native , james glasbrook . the main locations were hertford , luton , sundon , millbrook , bedford , clifton and northampton . it was a rural circuit made up of small societies whose total membership was just 208 people . rodell , jonathan .
