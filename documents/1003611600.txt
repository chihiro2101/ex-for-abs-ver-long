the history of emily montague . her literary reception is based mostly on this publication . it has been popular among scholars after its recovery , with more than a dozen scholarly articles written on its subject matter by 2004 . modern paperback reprints include a definitive scholarly edition . critics of brooke have studied themes present in emily montague , such as applying free-trade imperialism to 18th-century canada , proto-feminism , and displacing the french catholic threat in british columbian colonies . while the purpose and material of emily montague are often debated among critics , its reception as a work is largely neutral to negative . recent critics such as dermot mccarthy concede that '' brooke 's inability to imagine her ambivalence . is understandable given her time and background . however , her failure should not be endorsed . '' desmond pacey , in his essays in canadian criticism writes that '' emily montagues artistic shortcomings are obvious : the plot is thin , conventional , repetitive , and poorly integrated with the informative sections of the book ; the style is generally stilted and monotonous ; the characters , with one or two exceptions , are traditional in conception and deficient in life ; the whole performance is heavily didactic and sentimental . '' juliet mcmaster cites emily montague as a source of inspiration and parody for jane austen 's love and freindship , but states that overall , '' emily montague is no mean literary achievement . '' even in its own time , views divided on its value . the monthly review in its september 1769 issue wrote that its '' frost pieces . decorate a short story which has nothing extraordinary in it . '' while brooke is promoted as a canadian novelist , benet 's reader 's encyclopedia entry notes how '' brooke 's work was based on english models and had no perceptible effect on canadian literature . '' other brooke works , such as her 1777 novel the excursion , have received scholarly interest for their pastoral traditions and their political satire against the english theatre industry of the 18th century , while some of her works such as her 1781 play the siege of sinopoe have close to no reception . brooke 's personal life is the subject of a number of scholarly journals , mostly on her relations with actors david garrick and mary ann yates . brooke herself was the subject of her own monograph , and in recent years has gained popularity as the '' destroyer of english ( not literally ) '' after an online article published by the university of pennsylvania , which regards brooke as being used in the earliest oxford english dictionary citation of the hyperbolic use of the word '' literally '' to mean '' figuratively '' . in 1985 , the international astronomical union 's working group for planetary system nomenclature , approving 337 names for features on the surface of venus , honoured brooke by naming a crater after her . . further reading .
