Tree of the knowledge of good and evil

in genesis . narrative . genesis 2 narrates that yahweh places the first man and woman in a garden with trees of whose fruits they may eat , but forbids them to eat from '' the tree of the knowledge of good and evil . '' when , in genesis 3 , a serpent persuades the woman to eat from its forbidden fruit and she also lets the man taste it , god expels them from the garden . meaning of good and evil . the phrase in hebrew , literally translates as '' good and evil '' . this may be an example of the type of figure of speech known as merism , a literary device that pairs opposite terms together in order to create a general meaning , so that the phrase '' good and evil '' would simply imply '' everything '' . this is seen in the egyptian expression '' evil-good '' , which is normally employed to mean '' everything '' . in greek literature , homer also uses the device when telemachus states that '' i wish to know everything , the good and the evil '' ; although the words used – for '' good '' and for '' evil '' – are better termed '' superior '' and '' inferior '' . homer , however , if '' tree of the knowledge of good and evil '' is to be understood to mean a tree whose fruit imparts knowledge of everything , this phrase does not necessarily denote a moral concept . this view is held by several scholars . harry orlinsky 's notes to the njps torah . given the context of disobedience to god , other interpretations of the implications of this phrase also demand consideration . robert alter emphasizes the point that when god forbids the man to eat from that particular tree , he says that if he does so , he is '' doomed to die . '' the hebrew behind this is in a form regularly used in the hebrew bible for issuing death sentences . however , there are a myriad of modern scholarly interpretations regarding the term , '' the knowledge of good and evil '' , in genesis 2–3 , such as wisdom , omniscience , sexual knowledge , moral discrimination , maturity , and other qualities . to date , nathan french has offered the most extensive overview of the various scholarly interpretations in the history of research chapter found in the published version of his doctoral dissertation , wherein he contends for an interpretation of this term as '' the knowledge for administering reward and punishment , '' suggesting that the knowledge forbidden by yahweh and yet acquired by the humans in genesis 2–3 is the wisdom for wielding ultimate power . . religious views . judaism . in jewish tradition , the tree of knowledge and the eating of its fruit represents the beginning of the mixture of good and evil together . before that time , the two were separate , and evil had only a nebulous existence in potential . while free choice did exist before eating the fruit , evil existed as an entity separate from the human psyche , and it was not in human nature to desire it . eating and internalizing the forbidden fruit changed this , and thus was born the , the evil inclination . rashi to genesis 2:25 ramban to genesis 3:6 in rashi 's notes on genesis 3:3 , the first sin came about because eve added an additional clause to the divine command : '' neither shall you touch it . '' by saying this , eve added to yahweh command , and thereby came to detract from it , as it is written : '' do not add to his words '' . however , in legends of the jews , it was adam who had devoutly forbidden eve to touch the tree even though god had only mentioned the eating of the fruit . ginzberg , louis ( trans . henrietta szold , 1913 ) . the legends of the jews , vol . i . jewish publication society of america . p . 72 . in the kabbalah , the sin of the tree of knowledge ( called brought about the great task of , sifting through the mixture of good and evil in the world to extract and liberate the sparks of holiness trapped therein . epistle 26 , lessons in tanya , igeret hakodesh since evil no longer had independent existence , it henceforth depended on holiness to draw down the divine life-force , on whose '' leftovers '' it then feeds and derives existence . ch . 22 , tanya , likutei amarim once evil is separated from holiness through , its source of life is cut off , causing the evil to disappear . this is accomplished through observance of the 613 commandments in the torah , which deal primarily with physical objects wherein good and evil are mixed together . ch . 37 , lessons in tanya , likutei amarim torah ohr 3c torat chaim bereishit 30a thus , the task of rectifies the sin of the tree and draws the shechinah back down to earth , where the sin of the tree had caused her to depart . bereishit rabbah 19:7 ramban to genesis 3:8 . christianity . image : orvieto061.jpg thumb right 200px a marble bas relief by lorenzo maitani on the orvieto cathedral , italy depicts eve and the tree in christian tradition , consuming the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil was the sin committed by adam and eve that led to the fall of man in genesis 3 . in catholicism , augustine of hippo taught that the '' tree '' should be understood both symbolically and as a real tree – similarly to jerusalem being both a real city and a figure of heavenly jerusalem . augustine , on the literal meaning of genesis ( de genesi ad litteram ) , viii , 4.8 ; bibliothèque augustinniene 49 , 20 augustine underlined that the fruits of that tree were not evil by themselves , because everything that god created '' was good '' . it was disobedience of adam and eve , who had been told by god not to eat of the tree , that caused disorder in the creation , augustine of hippo , on the literal meaning of genesis ( de genesi ad litteram ) , viii , 6.12 and 13.28 , bibliothèque augustinniene 49,28 and 50–52 ; pl 34 , 377 ; cf . idem , de trinitate , xii , 12.17 ; ccl 50 , 371–372 v . 26–31 ; 1–36 ; de natura boni 34–35 ; csel 25 , 872 ; pl 42 , 551–572 thus humanity inherited sin and guilt from adam and eve 's sin . in western christian art , the fruit of the tree is commonly depicted as the apple , which originated in central asia . this depiction may have originated as a latin pun : by eating the ( apple ) , eve contracted ( evil ) . . gnosticism . uniquely , the gnostic religion held that the tree was entirely positive or even sacred . per this saga , it was the archons who told adam and eve not to eat from its fruit , before lying to them by claiming they would die after tasting it . later in the story , an instructor is sent from the pleroma by the aeons to save humanity and reveal gnosis . this savior does so by telling adam and eve that eating the fruit is the way into salvation . examples of the narrative can be found within the gnostic manuscripts on the origin of the world and the secret book of john . manichaeism , which has been considered a gnostic sect , echoes these notions as well , presenting the primordial aspect of jesus as the instructor . . islam . the quran never refers to the tree as the '' tree of the knowledge of good and evil '' but rather typically refers to it as '' the tree '' or ( in the words of iblis ) as the '' tree of immortality . '' quran 20:120 muslims believe that when god created adam and eve , he told them that they could enjoy everything in the garden except this tree and so satan appeared to them , telling them the only reason god forbade them to eat from the tree was that they would become angels or immortal . when they ate from this tree , their nakedness appeared to them , and they began to sew together leaves from the garden for their covering . the quran mentions the sin as being a 'slip ' . consequently , they repented to god and asked for his forgiveness , quran 7:23 and were forgiven . quran 2:37 in quran al-a'raf 27 , god states : . other cultures . a cylinder seal , known as the adam and eve cylinder seal , from post-akkadian periods in mesopotamia century bce ) has been linked to the adam and eve story . assyriology george smith ( 1840–1876 ) described the seal as having two facing figures ( male and female ) seated on each side of a tree , holding out their hands to the fruit , while between their backs is a serpent , giving evidence that the fall of man account was known in early times of babylonia . the british museum disputes this interpretation , and holds that it is a common image from the period depicting a male deity being worshiped by a woman , with no reason to connect the scene with the book of genesis . . see also . adam and eve ( latter day saint movement ) dream of the rood enlightenment ( spiritual ) original sin . references . bibliography .
