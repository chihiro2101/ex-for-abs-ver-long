Jimmy Young (boxer)

professional career . early fights . an inexperienced young was matched against contender earnie shavers in what was only his 11th professional fight . shavers , who at that time had a 42–2 record dealt young his first knockout loss . young had tried trading blows and was caught early on by one of the division 's hardest punchers his biography , as detailed in article itself below who was well known for his overwhelming early attacks . after this defeat young went undefeated for the next three years , including a win over contender ron lyle and a controversial draw in a re-match with earnie shavers with many observers scoring the bout for young . the improved outcome for young was largely due to improvements made to his defense since his last fight with the devastating hitter . despite young 's inability to earn a victory over shavers , it was still enough to earn him a title fight with the heavyweight champion of the world , muhammad ali . the young–ali fight . young achieved widespread public recognition when he fought muhammad ali at the capital center in landover , maryland on april 30 , 1976 for the world heavyweight title , although boxing circles had already noted his ability . ali weighed in at 230 pounds , the highest for any of his fights up to that point ( he would weigh 236.25 pounds in his fight against trevor berbick ) , and was consequently slow and immobile throughout the bout . seven years younger and 21 pounds lighter , young adopted a strategy of fighting aggressively from a distance , landing numerous light blows while dodging and parrying ali 's counterpunches , and using his body blows , which had little power behind them but were effective at scoring points . at close quarters , young would turn passive . in addition to retreating whenever possible , young often kept his head ducked very low in order to deter ali from landing blows at his head and risk censure from the referee for '' rabbit punching '' . on several occasions when ali was inside and young had his back to the ropes , young intentionally put his head or upper body out of the ring beyond the ropes to compel the referee to step in and separate the fighters . as a novel boxing tactic this divided opinion between its being a way of neutralizing ali 's game , to its being seen as an unsportsmanlike way of causing tactical stoppages every time ali possessed an advantage . at one point during the bout the referee did initiate a count due to young 's being outside the ropes . the fight went the full 15 rounds resulting in a controversial one-sided unanimous decision in favor of ali . referee tom kelly scored it 72–65 ; judges larry barrett and terry moore had it 70–68 and 71–64 , respectively . ken norton , ( a rival of ali ) who was commentating at ringside , had the fight even on his own scorecard . former ring editor lester bromberg called the decision a '' travesty '' . new york daily news reporter dick young said : '' ali won by the grace of three hero-worshipping fight officials . i believe many people , the voting officials among them , refuse to believe what they see when one of their super-heroes does n't function as expected . '' after the match 's televised broadcast many viewers called to the network to complain about the decision , and ali 's career trainer angelo dundee went on record as saying this was ali 's '' worst fight '' . after the match there were calls on ali to retire from the sport from quarters of the sport 's media . . rematch with lyle and then george foreman . young defeated lyle in a november 1976 rematch by using clever defense and a fast offensive style . he was able to dominate the older fighter , with one judge 's scorecard having young winning 11 of 12 rounds . in march 1977 , young then fought george foreman in san juan , puerto rico . foreman was on a five bout win streak since losing the title to muhammad ali in '' the rumble in the jungle '' , earning victories over top contenders ron lyle and joe frazier . the young–foreman fight was somewhat steady until the sixth round . the early rounds were punctuated by complaints from young and his corner about the use of elbows by foreman , who was punished by the referee with a point deduction . for the first half of the fight , young used his somewhat unorthodox boxing skills and good defense to keep out of harm 's way , while using his punching speed to counter . in the sixth round he became somewhat more aggressive himself and landed a number of clean punches on foreman . eleven seconds into the seventh round , foreman caught young with a left-handed body punch , and immediately followed with a powerful swinging left hand to the head . young reeled and turned away and seemed about to go down , while foreman tried to pursue his advantage , but somehow young survived to the end of the round . in his after-match comments on tv , he described it as '' desperation '' . after the near knockdown young rallied , and landed a number of good punches of his own . as the fight progressed foreman 's eyes became puffy and his punches lost their menace . for the rest of the contest , foreman continued to move forward , trying to cut off the ring and looking for the big knock out , while taking punches from the elusive young . in the final round young managed a knockdown over foreman , and earned a unanimous win by 12-round decision . the ring named the young–foreman bout its 1977 '' fight of the year '' . young joined ali as one of the only two men to beat foreman before his first retirement in 1977 . the young–norton eliminator fight . now the number two contender , young 's next fight was a mandatory world title eliminator against ken norton , the number 1 contender . young had won five straight since his loss to ali . young lost the norton match that occurred on november 1977 at caesar 's palace in las vegas , nevada , in a controversial split decision . many observers watching in attendance felt young should have been declared the winner . while young boxed cleverly , drawing norton onto sneak right hand punches , norton himself pressed forward dangerously , always his best style . the two had sparred when norton trained for his second ali match . howard cosell 1977 commentary on youtube norton had found shots thrown first to the head rarely landed so he used a heavy two-handed attack pounding away to the ribs , then lobbing powerful head shots . youtube young fight commentary the fight was set at 15 rounds . although this was unusual for a non-title match , the format was adopted due to the bout 's importance as an eliminator . due to the importance of the fight , which was later retro-designated as a wbc title match , a large crowd gathered to watch the bout including then world champion muhammad ali . although the winner of the fight was supposed to go on to fight for the heavyweight championship , leon spinks , who had won the championship from muhammad ali in an upset win on february 15 , 1978 , chose a rematch against ali instead of fighting norton for the wbc title . as a result , norton was awarded the wbc championship belt . later career . demoralised at having lost another close decision , young went into a gradual downward spiral . in june 1978 poor conditioning , an increasing problem , led to young being outpointed by prospect ossie ocasio . while better in a direct rematch , in january 1979 , ocasio again earned the win and went on to fight the world champion larry holmes . young won a short three-round brutal battle with unranked wendell bailey , showing flashes of old form . but in other matches of note young fared poorly . he was stopped due to cuts by new heavyweight contender gerry cooney after four rounds in a fight where he was dominated . he also lost on points to another rising prospect and future heavyweight champion michael dokes . in the 1979 match with dokes young was out of shape due to lack of training and weighed 229 & nbsp ; lbs . , nearly the heaviest he had weighed throughout his career and around 15 lbs . heavier than his ideal fighting weight . however young was able to slim down for his fight against british champion john l . gardner , occurring in december 1979 . young outpointed gardner , knocking him down in the 10th round . the triumph over gardner as well as wins against marvin stinson and jeff sims were probably his last notable wins . starting in 1981 young appeared to be making a comeback , winning five in a row , including a tko over previously unbeaten gordon racette . in 1982 however , young 's comeback was cut short when he was defeated on points by future champion greg page . he became a '' trial horse '' for emerging contenders , dropping decisions to more future champions in tony tucker and tony tubbs . he continued fighting with mixed results until 1988 , when he retired at the age of 39 . later life . after his boxing career , young had financial , drug , and legal problems . during a court hearing on a drug possession charge , his philadelphia public defender argued that young had symptoms of chronic traumatic brain injury due to his time in the ring . at a boxing celebrity event , the ring noted that young apparently needed to be helped about by his family . he was reported as being afflicted with dementia pugilistica in his last years . obituary for jimmy young , los angeles times , 24 february 2005 . . death . young died at hahnemann university hospital , philadelphia , at the age of 56 from a heart attack on february 20 , 2005 . he was interred at mount peace cemetery in philadelphia . real combat media . publications . jimmy young , heavyweight challenger ( 1979 ) , a biography by e . dolan and r . lyttle pub . doubleday . professional boxing record . { class '' wikitable '' style '' text-align : center ;
