Timeline of the early universe

the first 20 minutes . planck epoch . c . 0 seconds ( 13.799 ± 0.021 gya ) : planck epoch begins : earliest meaningful time . the big bang occurs in which ordinary space and time develop out of a primeval state ( possibly a virtual particle or false vacuum ) described by a quantum gravity or '' theory of everything '' . all matter and energy of the entire visible universe is contained in a hot , dense point ( gravitational singularity ) , a billionth the size of a nuclear particle . this state has been described as a particle desert . other than a few scant details , conjecture dominates discussion about the earliest moments of the universe 's history since no effective means of testing this far back in space-time is presently available . wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) or dark matter and dark energy may have appeared and been the catalyst for the expansion of the singularity . the infant universe cools as it begins expanding outward . it is almost completely smooth , with quantum variations beginning to cause slight variations in density . grand unification epoch . c . 10 −43 seconds : grand unification epoch begins : while still at an infinitesimal size , the universe cools down to 10 32 kelvin . gravity separates and begins operating on the universe—the remaining fundamental forces stabilize into the electronuclear force , also known as the grand unified force or grand unified theory ( gut ) , mediated by ( the hypothetical ) x and y bosons which allow early matter at this stage to fluctuate between baryon and lepton states . . electroweak epoch . c . 10 −36 seconds : electroweak epoch begins : the universe cools down to 10 28 kelvin . as a result , the strong nuclear force becomes distinct from the electroweak force perhaps fuelling the inflation of the universe . a wide array of exotic elementary particles result from decay of x and y bosons which include w and z bosons and higgs bosons . c . 10 −33 seconds : space is subjected to inflation , expanding by a factor of the order of 10 26 over a time of the order of 10 −33 to 10 −32 seconds . the universe is supercooled from about 10 27 down to 10 22 kelvin . guth , '' phase transitions in the very early universe '' , in : hawking , gibbon , siklos ( eds . ) , the very early universe ( 1985 ) . c . 10 −32 seconds : cosmic inflation ends . the familiar elementary particles now form as a soup of hot ionized gas called quark–gluon plasma ; hypothetical components of cold dark matter ( such as axions ) would also have formed at this time . quark epoch . c . 10 −12 seconds : electroweak phase transition : the four fundamental interactions familiar from the modern universe now operate as distinct forces . the weak nuclear force is now a short-range force as it separates from electromagnetic force , so matter particles can acquire mass and interact with the higgs field . the temperature is still too high for quarks to coalesce into hadrons , and the quark–gluon plasma persists ( quark epoch ) . the universe cools to 10 15 kelvin . c . 10 −11 seconds : baryogenesis may have taken place with matter gaining the upper hand over anti-matter as baryon to antibaryon constituencies are established . hadron epoch . c . 10 −6 seconds : hadron epoch begins : as the universe cools to about 10 10 kelvin , a quark-hadron transition takes place in which quarks bind to form more complex particles—hadrons . this quark confinement includes the formation of protons and neutrons ( nucleons ) , the building blocks of atomic nuclei . lepton epoch . c . 1 second : lepton epoch begins : the universe cools to 10 9 kelvin . at this temperature , the hadrons and antihadrons annihilate each other , leaving behind leptons and antileptons – possible disappearance of antiquarks . gravity governs the expansion of the universe : neutrinos decouple from matter creating a cosmic neutrino background . photon epoch . c . 10 seconds : photon epoch begins : most of the leptons and antileptons annihilate each other . as electrons and positrons annihilate , a small number of unmatched electrons are left over – disappearance of the positrons . c . 10 seconds : universe dominated by photons of radiation – ordinary matter particles are coupled to light and radiation while dark matter particles start building non-linear structures as dark matter halos . because charged electrons and protons hinder the emission of light , the universe becomes a super-hot glowing fog . c . 3 minutes : primordial nucleosynthesis : nuclear fusion begins as lithium and heavy hydrogen ( deuterium ) and helium nuclei form from protons and neutrons . c . 20 minutes : nuclear fusion ceases : normal matter consists of 75 % hydrogen nuclei and 25 % helium nuclei – free electrons begin scattering light . matter era . matter and radiation equivalence . c . 47,000 years ( z 3600 ) : matter and radiation equivalence : at the beginning of this era , the expansion of the universe was decelerating at a faster rate . c . 70,000 years : matter domination in universe : onset of gravitational collapse as the jeans length at which the smallest structure can form begins to fall . cosmic dark age . c . 370,000 years ( z 1,100 ) : the '' dark ages '' is the period between decoupling , when the universe first becomes transparent , until the formation of the first stars . recombination : electrons combine with nuclei to form atoms , mostly hydrogen and helium . distributions of hydrogen and helium at this time remains constant as the electron-baryon plasma thins . the temperature falls to 3000 kelvin . ordinary matter particles decouple from radiation . the photons present at the time of decoupling are the same photons that we see in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation . c . 400,000 years : density waves begin imprinting characteristic polarization ( waves ) signals . c . 10-17 million years : the '' dark ages '' span a period during which the temperature of cosmic background radiation cooled from some 4000 & nbsp ; k down to about 60 & nbsp ; k . the background temperature was between 373 & nbsp ; k and 273 & nbsp ; k , allowing the possibility of liquid water , during a period of about 7 million years , from about 10 to 17 million after the big bang ( redshift 137–100 ) . loeb ( 2014 ) speculated that abiogenesis might in principle have appeared during this window , which he called '' the habitable epoch of the early universe '' . c . 100 million years : gravitational collapse : ordinary matter particles fall into the structures created by dark matter . reionization begins : smaller ( stars ) and larger non-linear structures ( quasars ) begin to take shape – their ultraviolet light ionizes remaining neutral gas . 200–300 million years : first stars begin to shine : because many are population iii stars ( some population ii stars are accounted for at this time ) they are much bigger and hotter and their life-cycle is fairly short . unlike later generations of stars , these stars are metal free . as reionization intensifies , photons of light scatter off free protons and electrons – universe becomes opaque again . 200 million years : hd 140283 , the '' methuselah '' star , formed , the unconfirmed oldest star observed in the universe . because it is a population ii star , some suggestions have been raised that second generation star formation may have begun very early on . the oldest-known star ( confirmed ) – smss j031300.36-670839.3 , forms . 300 million years : first large-scale astronomical objects , protogalaxies and quasars may have begun forming . as population iii stars continue to burn , stellar nucleosynthesis operates – stars burn mainly by fusing hydrogen to produce more helium in what is referred to as the main sequence . over time these stars are forced to fuse helium to produce carbon , oxygen , silicon and other heavy elements up to iron on the periodic table . these elements , when seeded into neighbouring gas clouds by supernova , will lead to the formation of more population ii stars ( metal poor ) and gas giants . 380 million years : udfj-39546284 forms , current record holder for unconfirmed oldest-known quasar . 400 million years ( z 11 ) : gn-z11 , the oldest-known galaxy , forms . 420 million years : the quasar macs0647-jd , the , or one of the , furthest known quasars , forms . 600 million years he 1523-0901 , the oldest star found producing neutron capture elements forms , marking a new point in ability to detect stars with a telescope . 630 million years ( z 8.2 ) : grb 090423 , the oldest gamma ray burst recorded suggests that supernovas may have happened very early on in the evolution of the universe 670 million years : egs-zs8-1 , the most distant starburst or lyman-break galaxy observed , forms . this suggests that interacting galaxy is taking place very early on in the history of the universe as starburst galaxies are often associated with collisions and galaxy mergers . 700 million years : galaxies form . smaller galaxies begin merging to form larger ones . galaxy classes may have also begun forming at this time including blazars , seyfert galaxies , radio galaxies , and dwarf galaxies as well as regular types ( elliptical , barred spiral , and spiral galaxies ) . udfy-38135539 , the first distant quasar to be observed from the reionization phase , forms . dwarf galaxy z8 gnd 5296 forms . galaxy or possible proto-galaxy a1689-zd1 forms . 720 million years : possible formation of globular clusters in milky way 's galactic

galaxy iok-1 a lyman alpha emitter galaxy , forms . gn-108036 forms—galaxy is 5 times larger and 100 times more massive than the present day milky way illustrating the size attained by some galaxies very early on . 770 million years : quasar ulas j1120+0641 , one of the most distant , forms . one of the earliest galaxies to feature a supermassive black hole suggesting that such large objects existed quite soon after the big bang . the large fraction of neutral hydrogen in its spectrum suggests it may also have just formed or is in the process of star formation . 800 million years : farthest extent of hubble ultra deep field . formation of sdss j102915+172927 : unusual population ii star that is extremely metal poor consisting of mainly hydrogen and helium . he0107-5240 , one of the oldest population ii stars , forms as part of a binary star system . lae j095950.99+021219.1 , one of the most remote lyman alpha emitter galaxies , forms . lyman alpha emitters are considered to be the progenitors of spiral galaxies like the milky way . messier 2 , globular cluster , forms . 870 million years : messier 30 forms in the milky way . having experienced a core collapse ( cluster ) , the cluster has one of the highest densities among globular clusters . 890 million years : galaxy sxdf-nb1006-2 forms 900 million years : galaxy bdf-3299 forms . 910 million years : galaxy bdf-521 forms . galaxy epoch . 1 billion years ( 12.8 gya , z 6.56 ) : galaxy hcm-6a , the most distant normal galaxy observed , forms . formation of hyper-luminous quasar sdss j0100+2802 , which harbors a black hole with mass of 12 billion solar masses , one of the most massive black holes discovered so early in the universe . he1327-2326 , a population ii star , is speculated to have formed from remnants of earlier population iii stars . visual limit of the hubble deep field . reionization complete—the universe becomes transparent again . galaxy evolution continues as more modern looking galaxies form and develop . because the universe is still small in size , galaxy interactions become common place with larger and larger galaxies forming out of the galaxy merger process . galaxies may have begun clustering creating the largest structures in the universe so far - the first galaxy clusters and galaxy superclusters appear . 1.1 billion years ( 12.7 gya ) : age of the quasar cfhqs 1641+3755 . messier 4 globular cluster , first to have its individual stars resolved , forms in the halo of the milky way galaxy . among the clusters ' many stars , psr b1620-26 b forms . it is a gas
