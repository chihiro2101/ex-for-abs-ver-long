Maynard Ferguson

biography . early life and education . ferguson was born in verdun ( now part of montreal ) , quebec . encouraged by his mother and father ( both musicians ) , he started playing piano and violin at the age of four . at nine years old , he heard a cornet for the first time in his local church and asked his parents to buy one for him . when he was thirteen , he soloed with the canadian broadcasting corporation orchestra . he was heard frequently on the cbc , notably featured on a '' serenade for trumpet in jazz '' written for him by morris davis . he won a scholarship to the conservatoire de musique du québec à montréal where he studied from 1943 to 1948 with bernard baker . ferguson dropped out of the high school of montreal when he was fifteen to pursue a music career , performing in dance bands led by stan wood , roland david , and johnny holmes . although trumpet was his primary instrument , he also performed on other brass and reed instruments . he took over the dance band formed by his saxophonist brother percy , playing dates in the montreal area and serving as an opening act for touring bands from canada and the u.s . during this period , he came to the attention of american bandleaders and began receiving offers to go to the u.s . in 1948 , ferguson moved to the united states , intending to join stan kenton 's band , but it no longer existed , so ferguson played with the bands of boyd raeburn , jimmy dorsey , and charlie barnet . the barnet band included doc severinsen , ray wetzel , johnny howell , and rolf ericson . ferguson was featured on barnet 's recording of '' all the things you are '' by jerome kern . the recording enraged kern 's widow and was withdrawn from sale . . kenton and hollywood . in january 1950 , kenton formed the innovations orchestra , a 40-piece jazz orchestra with strings . after the folding of the barnet band , ferguson was available for the first rehearsal on january 1 . one of the orchestra 's recordings was named '' maynard ferguson , '' one of a series of pieces named after featured soloists . when kenton returned to a more practical 19-piece jazz band , ferguson continued with him at third chair with numerous solo features . notable recordings from this period that feature ferguson include '' invention for guitar and trumpet '' , '' what 's new ? '' , and '' the hot canary '' . in 1953 , ferguson left kenton and spent the next three years a session musician for paramount pictures . he appeared on 46 soundtracks , including the ten commandments . he also played on several other non-paramount film soundtracks , usually those with jazz scores . ferguson can clearly be discerned on several soundtracks from the time , including the martin and lewis films '' living it up '' and '' you 're never too young . '' he still recorded jazz , but his paramount contract prevented him from playing in jazz clubs . this was sometimes circumvented by appearing under aliases such as '' tiger brown '' or '' foxy corby '' . although he enjoyed the steady income , he was unhappy with the lack of live performance opportunities and left paramount in 1956 . the birdland dream band . ferguson played with the pérez prado on the lp havana 3 a.m . , recorded in february and march 1956 . in 1956 , he joined the birdland dream band , a 14-piece big band formed by morris levy as an '' all-star '' lineup to play at levy 's birdland jazz club in new york city . although the name '' birdland dream band '' was short-lived and is represented by only two albums over the course of a year , this band became the core of ferguson 's performing band for the next nine years . the band included mike abene , jaki byard , bill chase , ronnie cuber , frankie dunlop , don ellis , joe farrell , dusko goykovich , tony inzalaco , rufus jones , willie maiden , ron mcclure , rob mcconnell , don menza , lanny morgan , wayne shorter , and joe zawinul . those who were both arrangers and performers included herb geller , slide hampton , bill holman , and don sebesky . in 1959 ferguson was a guest with the new york philharmonic under the direction of leonard bernstein performing symphony no . 2 in c '' titans '' by william russo . in 1961 , ferguson composed the theme music for the 1961–1962 abc adventure drama television series straightaway . his 1961 album '' straightaway '' jazz themes contained the music he composed for the series . as big bands declined in popularity and economic viability in the 1960s , ferguson 's band performed less frequently . he began to feel musically stifled and sensed a resistance to change among his american jazz audiences . according to an interview in down beat , he was quoted as saying that if the band did not play '' maria '' or '' ole , '' the fans went home disappointed . he began performing with a sextet before shutting down his big band in 1966 . . millbrook , india , and psychedelics . after leaving his long-time recording contract and the end of his main club gig , ferguson moved his family to the hitchcock estate in millbrook , new york in november 1963 to live with timothy leary , ram dass , and their community from harvard university . he and his wife flo used lsd , psilocybin and other psychedelic drugs . they lived at millbrook for about three years , playing clubs and recording several albums . ferguson was mentioned in the electric kool-aid acid test , which detailed the psychedelic scene . in 1967 , as the millbrook experiment was ending , ferguson moved his family to india and taught at the krishnamurti-based rishi valley school near madras . he was associated with the sri sathya sai university 's boys brass band , which he founded and helped teach for several years . while in india , he was influenced by sathya sai baba , whom he considered as his spiritual guru . . england and jazz rock . as a canadian in england , ferguson avoided the union 's ban on american musicians . in 1969 , he moved to oakley green , a hamlet on the outskirts of windsor , near london . he had two houses while he was in the uk , the final one a three-story house by the river thames . that same year , ferguson signed with cbs records . he started a sixteen- to eighteen-piece big band with british musicians playing jazz rock . the band got attention for its version of '' macarthur park '' by jim webb . ferguson 's band made its north american debut in 1971 . in 1970 he led the band on the simon dee show from london weekend television . . return to the u.s . ferguson moved to new york city in 1973 , then relocated to ojai , california less than two years later . he replaced the british band members with american musicians while reducing membership to twelve : four trumpets , two trombones , three saxophones , and a three-piece rhythm section . albums from this period include m.f . horn 4 & 5 : live at jimmy 's and chameleon , recorded in 1973 and 1974 in new york . ferguson took advantage of the burgeoning jazz education movement by hiring musicians from colleges with jazz programs , such as berklee college of music , north texas state university and the university of miami . he performed for young audiences and gave master classes in colleges and high schools . this strategy helped him develop an audience that sustained him for the rest of his career . in 1975 , ferguson began working with bob james on a series of commercially successful albums with large groups of session musicians , including strings , vocalists , and guest soloists . the first of these albums was primal scream , featuring chick corea , mark colby , steve gadd , and bobby militello . the second , conquistador ( 1976 ) yielded a no . 22 pop single , '' gon na fly now '' from the movie rocky , earning him a gold album . he maintained a hectic touring schedule . the commercial success included adding a guitarist and an additional percussionist to his band 's lineup . in the summer of 1976 , ferguson performed a solo trumpet piece for the closing ceremonies of the summer olympics in montreal , symbolically '' blowing out the flame '' . ferguson became frustrated with columbia over the inability to use his working band on albums and to play jazz songs on them . his contract with columbia ended after the release of the album hollywood ( 1982 ) , produced by bassist stanley clarke . during that time , he recorded an instrumental version of the michael jackson song '' do n't stop 'til you get enough '' ; the song would later be used by rede globo as the theme song of vídeo show , which ran on the network between 1983 and 2019 . ferguson recorded three big band albums with smaller labels before forming high voltage , a fusion septet , in 1986 . this smaller ensemble , which featured multi-reed player denis diblasio , gave ferguson the freedom explore in a less structured format . high voltage recorded two albums , produced by jim exon , his manager and son in law . big bop nouveau . to mark his 60th birthday in 1988 , maynard ferguson returned to a large band format and to more mainstream jazz . that then led to the formation of big bop nouveau , a nine-piece band featuring two trumpets , one trombone , three reeds and a three-piece rhythm section which became his standard touring group for the remainder of his career . later , due to the increasing responsibilities being placed on the trumpet players , the baritone sax position was replaced by a third trumpet player . the band 's repertoire included original jazz compositions and modern arrangements of jazz standards , with occasional pieces from his '70s book and even modified charts from the birdland dream band era ; this format proved to be successful with audiences and critics . the band recorded extensively , including albums backing vocalists diane schuur and michael feinstein . big bop nouveau toured the world extensively ; in 2005 it embarked on a tour of eight months playing an average of two hundred shows a year . the group was tour managed by memphis legend ed sargent , and mixed by audio mogul mike freeland . although in later years ferguson 's playing occasionally lost some of the range and phenomenal accuracy of his youth , he always remained an exciting performer , touring an average of nine months a year with big bop nouveau for the remainder of his life . ferguson died on august 23 , 2006 . during the late 1980s , ferguson returned to a big band format when he formed big bop nouveau . he made albums with this band until the end of the next decade . . personal life . in 1973 , ferguson settled in ojai , california , where he lived to the end of his life . his first marriage was to singer kay brown . his marriage to flo ferguson ( in 1956 ) lasted until her death on february 27 , 2005 . ferguson had three daughters : corby , lisa , and wilder , a step daughter , kim , through flo 's marriage to jim hamza , and a son , bentley , who predeceased his parents . kim ferguson is married to maynard 's former manager , jim exon . wilder ferguson is married to jazz pianist ( film composer and former big bop nouveau member ) christian jacob . lisa ferguson is a writer and film maker living in los angeles . at the time of his death , ferguson had two granddaughters , erica and sandra . ferguson died as a result of kidney and liver failure , on august 23 , 2006 , at the community memorial hospital in ventura , california . jon thurber ( august 25 , 2006 ) . “ maynard ferguson , 78 ; trumpeter , big band leader achieved pop success ” . los angeles times . . versatility . although his principal instrument was the trumpet , ferguson frequently doubled on other brass instruments , most notably the relatively uncommon valve trombone . several recording sessions with bandleader russell garcia included a four-trombone ensemble in which ferguson played only valve trombone . publicity shots and album covers from the 1950s showed ferguson with his 'quartet ' of trumpet , valve trombone , baritone horn , and french horn . recordings of the latter two are rare ; the french horn vanished in later years , but the baritone horn appeared on the 1974 album chameleon . he switched to the combination valve/slide superbone and flugelhorn on all but his last recorded album . ferguson designed : the firebird and the superbone . the firebird was similar to a trumpet , but the valves were played with the left hand instead of the right , and a trombone-style slide was played with the right hand . trumpeter rajesh mehta bought this trumpet while living in amsterdam and played the firebird from 1998 until 2011 when he had american trumpet maker george schlub create the orka-m naga phoenix trumpet for him . the superbone was another hybrid instrument , a trombone with additional valves played with the left hand . ferguson incorporated indian instruments and influences in his music . ferguson was not the first trumpeter to play in the extreme upper register ( such as cat anderson ) , but he could play high notes with full , rich tone , power , and musicality . in interviews he said that his command of the upper registers was based mostly on breath control , something he discovered as a kid in montreal . he attributed the longevity of his technique to the spiritual and yoga studies he pursued in india . ferguson brought charisma to a musical genre that is often seen as cold and cerebral . his obituary in the washington post stated : '' ferguson lit up thousands of young horn players , most of them boys , with pride and excitement . in a ( high school ) world often divided between jocks and band nerds , ferguson crossed over , because he approached his music almost as an athletic event . on stage , he strained , sweated , heaved and roared . he nailed the upper registers like shaq nailing a dunk or lawrence taylor nailing a running back & ndash ; and the audience reaction was exactly the same : the guttural shout , the leap to their feet , the fists in the air . we cheered maynard as a gladiator , a combat soldier , a prize fighter , a circus strongman & ndash ; choose your masculine archetype . '' . awards and honors . ferguson was appointed a member of the order of canada in 2003 . in 1950 , 1951 , and 1952 , ferguson won the down beat readers ' poll for best trumpeter . in 1992 , he was inducted into the down beat jazz hall of fame . maynard ferguson plays a special solo trumpet piece as part of the closing ceremonies for the summer olympics in montreal , canada , the xxi olympiad , 1976 . in 2000 , ferguson was initiated as a brother of kappa kappa psi at the gamma xi chapter ( university of maryland at college park ) . in 2006 , he was presented with phi mu alpha sinfonia music fraternity 's charles e . lutton man of music award at its national convention in cleveland , ohio . he had been initiated as an honorary member of the fraternity 's xi chi chapter at tennessee tech university in 1976 . the maynard ferguson institute of jazz studies at rowan university was created in 2000 , the same year rowan bestowed ferguson with his only honorary doctorate degree . the institute , under direction of ferguson 's friend denis diblasio , supports the rowan jazz program in training young jazz musicians . maynard ferguson band alumni regrouped for a memorial concert soon after his death , led by trumpeters wayne bergeron , patrick hession , walter white , and eric miyashiro . in 2000 , he was given an honorary doctorate degree by rowan university in glassboro , new jersey , and created the maynard ferguson institute of jazz studies under the direction of denis diblasio in their college of performing arts . the sherman jazz museum in sherman , texas opened in 2010 and houses the extensive memorabilia of ferguson 's estate . discography . by release date . as leader . 1955 – jam session featuring maynard ferguson ( emarcy ) 1956 – maynard ferguson 's hollywood party ( emarcy ) 1956 – around the horn with maynard ferguson ( emarcy ) 1956 – dimensions ( emarcy ) 1955 – maynard ferguson octet ( emarcy ) 1957 – & nbsp ; maynard ferguson and his birdland dream band 1957 – & nbsp ; the birdland dream band , vol . 2 1957 – boy with lots of brass ( emarcy ) 1958 – swingin ' my way through college ( roulette ) 1958 – a message from newport ( roulette ) 1959 – a message from birdland ( roulette ) 1959 – maynard ferguson plays jazz for dancing ( roulette ) 1960 – newport suite ( roulette ) 1960 – let 's face the music and dance ( roulette ) 1961 – maynard '61 ( roulette ) 1961 – double exposure with chris connor ( atlantic ) 1961 – '' straightaway '' jazz themes ( roulette ) 1961 – two 's company with chris connor ( roulette ) 1962 – maynard '62 ( roulette ) 1962 – si ! si ! m.f .
