george bernard shaw 's major barbara at a 90-seat theater in the round circle theater off sunset boulevard . one of the actors in the play was sydney chaplin , who was the son of actors charlie

to ed simmons , who wanted to be a comedy writer . simmons and lear teamed up to sell home furnishings door-to-door for a company called the gans brothers and later sold family photos door-to-door .

working-class tory and his socialist son-in-law . lear 's second big tv sitcom was also based on a british sitcom , steptoe and son , about a west london junk dealer and his son . lear changed the setting to the watts section of los angeles and the characters to african-americans , and the nbc show sanford and son was an instant hit . numerous hit shows followed thereafter , including maude ,
