'' léo delibes '' , le figaro , 17 january 1891 , p . 1 ( in french ) he studied first with antoine-jules tariot ( music theory ) , and then with félix le couppey ( piano ) , françois benoist ( organ ) , françois bazin ( harmony ) and , at eighteen , adolphe adam ( composition ) . curzon , p . 9 as a boy , delibes had an unusually fine singing voice ; he was a chorister at the church of la madeleine and sang in the première of meyerbeer 's le prophète at the paris opéra in 1849 . while still a student delibes became organist of and accompanist at the théâtre lyrique . at the latter he took part in the preparation of most of the operas in the theatre 's repertoire , including classics such as the marriage of figaro and fidelio and new works such as louis clapisson 's la fanchonnette , victor massé 's la reine topaze and gounod 's faust . his biographer hugh macdonald writes that although delibes remained a church organist until 1871 ( he held several posts , the last of them at the church of saint jean-saint françois from 1862 ) , he was '' clearly drawn more to the theatre and found his métier at hervé 's highly successful folies-nouvelles '' . . composer . in 1856 delibes ' first stage work was premiered at the folies-nouvelles : deux sous de charbon ( two sou ( coin ) of coal ) , a one-act comic piece to a libretto by jules moinaux , described as an '' asphyxie lyrique '' . curzon , p . 13 over the next fourteen years he produced more comic operas , at an average rate of about one a year . many were written for the bouffes-parisiens , the theatre run by jacques offenbach , including deux vieilles gardes ( '' two old guards '' ) , delibes 's second opera , which enjoyed enormous success , attributable in macdonald 's view to the composer 's gift for '' witty melody and lightness of touch '' . in addition to composing , delibes earned a living as a critic ( briefly in 1858 ) ; inspector of school music ; and accompanist and later chorus master at the opéra ( from 1862 or 1863 ) . his appointment at the opéra led to a new career as a composer of ballet music . in 1866 he was commissioned to compose two acts of la source , the other two being written by ludwig minkus . in the view of the musicologist and critic adolphe jullien , delibes '' displayed such a wealth of melody as a composer of ballet music '' that minkus was '' completely eclipsed '' . jullien , p . 687 delibes was immediately invited to compose a waltz-divertissement called le pas de fleurs to be introduced into the ballet of his former teacher adam , le corsaire , for a revival in 1867 . the piece was later incorporated into delibes ' music for la source when it was revived . grymes , james ( 2015 ) . notes to hyperion cd cda6796 in 1869 delibes composed his last opérette , la cour du roi pétaud , for the variétés . curzon , p . 88 the following year he came to wider public notice with his score for the ballet coppélia , first performed at the opéra in may 1870 . it was an immediate success , and has remained among the most popular works in the classical ballet repertoire . the following year he resigned from the musical staff of the opéra and devoted himself wholly to composition . in that year he married léontine estelle denain . curzon , p . 118 not wishing to be typecast as a ballet composer , delibes next turned to mélodies . in 1872 he published a collection including the songs '' myrto '' , '' les filles de cadiz '' and '' bonjour suzon '' . johnson , p . 129 ; and curzon , p . 53 in 1873 he produced at the opéra-comique a comic opera in three acts , le roi l ' a dit ( the king has said it ) . le figaro thought the libretto weak , but praised delibes ' music : '' his melodic vein , his impeccable taste , his scenic skill , his beautiful humour saved a work which , without him , would have gone unnoticed '' . the work was a success in paris and in german opera houses , but did not establish itself in the international repertory . its first performances in britain ( 1894 ) and the us ( 2016 ) were by students of , respectively , the royal college of music and the manhattan school of music . '' le roi l ' a dit '' , the era , 15 december 1894 , p . 7 ; and '' le roi l ' a dit '' , opera news , june 2016 delibes returned to the opéra in 1876 , with a grand mythological ballet , sylvia , which in jullien 's view confirmed delibes ' superiority in dance music . it was well received by the press and public . in 1877 delibes was made a chevalier de la legion d'honneur . despite the success of his two ballets , delibes was still anxious to write a serious vocal work , and composed a grand scena , la mort d'orphée ( the death of orpheus ) , given at the trocadéro concerts in 1878 during the exposition universelle . '' leo delibes '' , the musical world , 24 january 1891 , pp . 69–70 he followed that with a serious opera , jean de nivelle , a medieval patriotic romance , premiered at the opéra-comique in 1880 . reviewers found the piece too episodic but praised the composer for '' the rare and precise quality '' of his melodies and '' the delicate style in his writing '' for the public . the parisian critic for the era considered it '' the best opera , the one most likely to attain a world-wide popularity , since bizet 's . carmen '' , premiered five years previously . '' the drama in paris '' , the era , 14 march 1880 , p . 7 the piece ran for more than a hundred performances , and was revived in paris in 1908 but has not ( in 2020 ) been staged there since then . pottinger , mark .

'' 'lakme ' in paris '' , the era , 21 april 1881 , p . 7 macdonald writes : lakmé was quickly taken up by opera houses across europe , and productions followed in london ( 1885 ) and new york ( 1886 ) ; reviews of the american production were highly enthusiastic ; those of the british production were less so , but in both cities it prospered at the box-office .

'' in van vechten 's view , delibes revolutionised ballet music by introducing in his scores '' a symphonic element , a wealth of graceful melody , and a richness of harmonic fibre , based , it is safe to hazard , on a healthy distaste for routine '' . van vechten considers delibes ' scores to be the forerunners of 20th-century ballets such as debussy 's jeux , ravel 's daphnis et chloé and stravinsky 's petrouchka . after sylvia , delibes 's only composition for dance was a suite of six dances for the comédie-française production of le roi s'amuse , the dances , in a pastiche of antique style , show a keen ear for the nuances of period character in goodwin 's view . they are not often played in concert and are more familiar in recordings . . mélodies . the pianist and musical scholar graham johnson quotes the musicologist fritz noske 's view that delibes ' songs derive from the chansonnette , '' lighter and more entertaining than the romance , and less susceptible to the german influence of the lied '' . in his songs , delibes shares with bizet '' a natural feeling for the theatre , and an ability to spin local colour '' , as in his chanson espagnole '' les filles de cadix '' . of other early songs , johnson describes '' eclogue '' and '' bonjour , suzon '' as '' charming us with their unpretentious gaiety and delicacy , as well as their economy of means '' . some of the songs evoke the period style of the 16th century , such as '' avril '' , '' chanson de l'oiseleur '' and '' myrto '' , the last of which is a pre-echo of mélodies by gabriel fauré . johnson finds delibes more suited to reflective than to passionate sentiments , and , in general , better in more of his earlier songs than his later . he brackets delibes with his junior contemporary reynaldo hahn as songwriters – '' charmers both with a similarly eighteenth-century idea of the role of music in refined society : the unashamed giving of pleasure '' . johnson , pp . 129–130 . notes , references and sources . notes . . references . . sources . . external links . list of works by delibes at the index to opera and ballet sources online ballet notes : '' léo delibes ''
