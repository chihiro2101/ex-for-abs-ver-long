Byzantine text-type

manuscripts of the byzantine text . it should be noted , we have no early witness discoveries of either the byzantine text type or the alexandrian text type manuscripts that originate from where the original new testament scriptures were either authored or initially sent to , which was the greater byzantine area . the earliest church father to witness to a byzantine text-type in substantial new testament quotations is john chrysostom ( c . 349 – 407 ) ; although the fragmentary surviving works of asterius the sophist ( † 341 ) have also been considered to conform to the byzantine text , gordon d . fee , '' the use of greek patristic citations in new testament textual criticism : the state of the question , '' pp . 344–359 in studies in the theory and method of new testament textual criticism ( ed . eldon j . epp and gordon d . fee ; studies & documents 45 ; grand rapids : eerdmans , 1993 ) , p . 358 . and the incomplete surviving translation of ulfilas ( d . 383 ) into gothic is often thought to derive from the byzantine text type or an intermediary between the byzantine and western text types . bennett , william , 1980 , an introduction to the gothic language , pp . 24-25 . chrysostom and asterius used text only in 75 % agreed with the standard byzantine text . the second earliest translation to witness to a greek base conforming generally to the byzantine text in the gospels is the syriac peshitta ( though it has many alexandrian and western readings ) ; usually dated to the beginning of the 5th century ; although in respect of several much contested readings , such as mark 1:2 and john 1:18 , the peshitta rather supports the alexandrian witnesses . dating from the fourth century , and hence possibly earlier than the peshitta , is the ethiopic version of the gospels ; best represented by the surviving fifth and sixth century manuscripts of the garima gospels and classified by rochus zuurmond as '' early byzantine '' . zuurmond notes that , especially in the gospel of john , the form of the early byzantine text found in the ethiopic gospels is quite different from the later greek majority text , and agrees in a number of places with papyrus 66 . '' one would say that the ethiopian versio antiqua is basically a byzantine text , with some western elements and some remnants of the early egyptian text . for lack of a better term one could coin this '' early byzantine '' . the ethiopic text in the gospels of mark and matthew are closer to the greek majority text , while still differing in a number of notable readings ; but the ethiopic text of the rest of the new testament is clearly alexandrian . jerome , in his vulgate revision of the latin gospels text completed around 384 , made eclectic use of greek manuscripts of both byzantine and alexandrian text-types . the form of the byzantine text found in the earliest witnesses is not a monolithic whole ; but sometimes differs consistently from the form of text found in the most common sub-group of byzantine manuscripts as they proliferated after the 11th century . for example , the story of jesus and the woman taken in adultery is absent from the gospel of john in all early byzantine witnesses and versions , but by 11th century has become standard in medieval byzantine witnesses . amongst the bulk of later new testament manuscripts it is generally possible to demonstrate a clear byzantine majority reading for each variant ; and a greek new testament text based on these majority readings— '' the majority text '' —has been produced by zane c . hodges and arthur l . farstad , although this text does not correspond to any one particular manuscript . notable byzantine manuscripts . 46 , א , a , b , c , 33 , 1739 , arm : : א c , c 3 , d b , c , g , k , ψ , 81 , 88 , 104 , 181 , 326 , 330 , 436 , 451 , 614 , 629 , 630 , 1241 , 1739 mg , 1877 , 1881 , 1962 , 1984 , 1985 , 2127 , 2492 , 2495 , byz , lect : : d gr : : c , dem , f , t , x , z c , vg ( tradetur ) , cop , eth . special cases . in mark 6:33 and luke 24:53 the byzantine text-type looks like a combination of the alexandrian and the western text . in other cases the situation is more complicated . mark 1:13 looks like a combination of the alexandrian and the caesarean text . origin of the byzantine text . in order to displace the textus receptus ( see the following section ) from its initially prominent position among printed editions of the greek new testament , later textual scholars of the critical text persuasion saw the need for a thoroughgoing theory of the transmission of the text that could effectively disregard the overwhelmingly numerical superiority of the byzantine text which formed its base . this westcott-hort 's introduction accomplished in masterful detail ( over the course of 600 pages ) as the culmination of 28 years of laborious effort on their part . they summarize the problem early on in their work ( p . & nbsp ; 45 ) as follows : '' a theoretical presumption indeed remains that a majority of extant documents is more likely to represent a majority of ancestral documents at each stage of transmission than vice versa . '' in the discussion that follows , they reason that the '' incalculable and fortuitous complexity of the causes here at work '' in the transmission of the text leads them to the conclusion that '' every ground for expecting ' a priori ' any sort of correspondence of numerical proportion between existing documents and their less numerous ancestors in any one age falls to the ground . '' among those modern scholars who believe that the byzantine text is only a secondary witness to the original text of the autographs , there is some debate concerning the origin of the byzantine text and the reasons for its widespread existence and use . the suggestions that have been put forward are : that lucian of antioch used his text critical skills to produce a recension . ( jerome makes reference to lucian 's recension of the old testament only . wescott and hort favored this theory . ) that constantine i paid for the wide distribution of manuscripts which came from a common source . ( there are several references by eusebius of caesarea to constantine paying for manuscript production ) . that after the western roman empire stopped using greek , and because of barbarian and muslim invasions , eliminating the possibility for either jerusalem or caesarea to exercise any further influence on the text of the greek new testament , the only church to actively preserve the greek text was the eastern orthodox church , which exercised central control from the see of constantinople and withstood the muslims until the 15th century . ( see also state church of the roman empire . ) the standard byzantine text used by the eastern , greek-speaking greek orthodox church is supported by late minuscule manuscripts dating after the 4th century . however , some are earlier and a few papyri are also classified here . the early byzantine text is near to the alexandrian text in that it differs from the late byzantine text in roughly 3000 places . kurt aland did not consider early byzantine families such as e and π to be classified as byzantine manuscripts . he placed some of them into category iii of the greek new testament manuscripts . aland placed all manuscripts with standard byzantine text into category v . the textus receptus . the first printed edition of the greek new testament was completed by erasmus and published by johann froben of basel on march 1 , 1516 ( novum instrumentum omne ) . due to the pressure of his publisher to bring their edition to market before the competing complutensian polyglot , erasmus based his work on around a half-dozen manuscripts , all of which dated from the twelfth century or later ; and all but one were of the byzantine text-type . six verses that were not witnessed in any of these sources , he back-translated from the latin vulgate , and erasmus also introduced many readings from the vulgate and church fathers . this text came to be known as the textus receptus or received text after being thus termed by bonaventura elzevir , an enterprising publisher from the netherlands , in his 1633 edition of erasmus ' text . the new testament of the king james version of the bible was translated from editions of what was to become the textus receptus . the different byzantine '' majority text '' of hodges & farstad as well as robinson & pierpont is called '' majority '' because it is considered to be the greek text established on the basis of the reading found in the vast majority of the greek manuscripts . the textus receptus differs from the majority text in 1,838 greek readings , of which 1,005 represent '' translatable '' differences . michael d . marlowe states : yet it differs from the received text in about a thousand places , most of them being trivial . while daniel b . wallace has counted 1,838 differences between it and the textus receptus . . modern critical texts . karl lachmann ( 1850 ) was the first new testament textual critic to produce an edition that broke with the textus receptus , relying mainly instead on manuscripts from the alexandrian text-type . although the majority of new testament textual critics now favor a text that is alexandrian in complexion , especially after the publication of westcott and hort 's edition , there remain some proponents of the byzantine text-type as the type of text most similar to the autographs . these critics include the editors of the hodges and farstad text ( cited below ) , and the robinson and pierpont text . around 6,500 readings will differ from the hodges and farstad text depending on which modern critical text is taken as an exemplar of the alexandrian text-type ( wallace 1989 ) . to give a feel for the difference between the byzantine form of text and the eclectic text , which is mainly alexandrian in character , of 800 variation units in the epistle of james collected by the institute for new testament textual research , the byzantine and eclectic texts are in agreement in 731 of the places ( a rate of 92.3 % ) . many of the 69 disagreements involve differences in word order and other variants that do not appear as translatable differences in english versions . according to the preface to the new king james version of the bible , the textus receptus , the alexandrian text-type and the byzantine text-type are 85 % identical ( that is , of the variations that occur in any manuscript , only 15 % actually differ between these three ) . the byzantine type is also found in modern greek orthodox editions . a new scholarly edition of the byzantine text of john 's gospel , ( funded by the united bible societies in response to a request from eastern orthodox scholars ) , was begun in birmingham , uk . and in 2007 , as a result of these efforts , the gospel according to john in the byzantine tradition was published . von soden divided manuscripts of the byzantine text into five groups : k x : no uncials , hundreds of minuscules , among them codex 2 , 3 , 8 , 14 , 45 , 47 , 49 , 51 , 54 , 56 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 61 , 73 , 75 , 76 , 78 , etc . k r : no uncials , no early minuscules , hundreds of minuscules : 18 , 35 , 55 , 66 , 83 , 128 , 141 , 147 , 155 , 167 , 170 , 189 , 201 k 1 ( subfamily of k x ) : s v ω 461 k i ( family e ) : e f g h i k ( also k a ) , now family π : ( a ) k y π ; this subgroup is the oldest , but only 5 % of manuscripts belong to it . majority of them have text mixed with other byzantine subfamilies . since the discovery of the papyrus 45 , papyrus 46 , and papyrus 66 , proof is available that occasionally the byzantine text preserves a reading that dates from early witness . examples : luke 10:39 : : p 45 p 75 a w byz b : : א b d l ξ 579 892 cop bo syr c luke 10:42 : : p 45 p 75 a c w byz : : b : : א : : 38 syr pal gordon d . fee , p75 , p66 , and origen : the myth of early textual recension in alexandria , p . 253 . luke 11:33 : : א b f θ f 1 f 13 : : p 45 33 byz john 10:29 : : b it : : p 66 f 1 f 13 byz john 11:32 : : א b c d l x : : p 66 θ byz john 13:26 : : א b c l x 33 : : p 66 c a θ acts 17:13 : : : omitted : p 45 e byz 1 corinthians 9:7 : : א a b d g p : : p 46 byz ephesians 5:9 : : א a b d g p : : p 46 byz philippians 1:14 : : א a b ( d ) p ψ 33 81 104 326 365 629 1175 1241 2464 : omitted : p 46 d 2 byz other examples of byzantine readings were found in p 66 in john 1:32 ; 3:24 ; 4:14.51 ; 5:8 ; 6:10.57 ; 7:3.39 ; 8:41.51.55 ; 9:23 ; 10:38 ; 12:36 ; 14:17 . this supports the views of scholars such as harry sturz ( 1984 ) and maurice robinson ( 2005 ) that the roots of the byzantine text may go back to a very early date . ( in 1963 bruce metzger had argued that early support for byzantine readings could not be taken to demonstrate that they were in the original text . ) bruce m . metzger , chapters in the history of new testament textual criticism , wm . b . eerdmans , grand rapids 1963 , p . 38 some authors have interpreted this as a rehabilitation of textus receptus . edward f . hills , dean burgon in the light of recent research ; d . a . waite , defending the king james bible , bible for today , collingswood , new jersey 2004 . many of these readings have substantial support from other text-types and they are not distinctively byzantine . daniel wallace found only two agreements distinctively between papyrus and byzantine readings . d . wallace , the majority text theory : history , methods , and critique , in studies & documents 1995 , p . 303
