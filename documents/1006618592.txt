Steven Bochco

early life . bochco was born to a jewish family jewish journal : '' change of command on ‘ commander in chief ’ '' by naomi pfefferman october 13 , 2005 in new york city , the son of mimi , a painter , and rudolph bochco , a concert violinist . he was educated in manhattan at the high school of music and art . his elder sister is actress joanna frank . in 1961 , he enrolled at the carnegie mellon university ( after merging with the mellon institute in 1967 , now known as carnegie mellon university ) in pittsburgh to study playwriting and theater . he graduated with a bachelor of fine arts ( bfa ) in theater in 1966 , having also had an mca writing fellowship . . career . bochco went to work for universal studios as a writer and then story editor on ironside , columbo , mcmillan & wife , and the short-lived lorne greene and ben murphy series , griff , as well as delvecchio and the invisible man . he wrote the story and teleplay for the columbo episode '' murder by the book '' ( 1971 ) , and the teleplays for several other episodes . he wrote the screenplay for the 1968 film the counterfeit killer and worked on silent running ( 1972 ) and double indemnity ( 1973 ) . he left universal in 1978 to go to mtm enterprises where he had greater scope for producing . his first effort there was the short-lived cbs police drama paris , notable as the first series on which james earl jones played a lead role . he achieved major success for nbc with the police drama hill street blues . it ran from 1981 to 1987 and bochco was credited as co-creator , also writing and producing . the series also garnered considerable critical acclaim and many awards , and was nominated for a total of 98 emmy awards throughout its run . bochco was fired from mtm in 1985 following the failure of bay city blues ( 1983 ) . bochco moved to 20th century fox where he co-created and produced l.a . law ( 1986–94 ) which aired on nbc . this series was also widely acclaimed and a regular award winner . in 1987 , bochco co-created the half-hour dramedy hooperman which starred john ritter but was canceled after two seasons , despite bochco offering to take over direct day-to-day control of a third season . hooperman was part of a lucrative deal with abc in 1987 to create and produce ten new television series , which prompted bochco to form steven bochco productions . from this deal came doogie howser , m.d . ( 1989–93 ) and cop rock ( 1990 ) . the latter combined straight police drama with live-action broadway singing and dancing , and was one of his highest-profile failures . in 1992 , bochco created an animated television series , capitol critters , along with nat mauldin and michael wagner . after a lull , bochco co-created nypd blue ( 1993–2005 ) with david milch . initially controversial at the time , the series was created with the express intention of changing the nature of network one-hour drama to compete with the more adult fare broadcast on cable networks . the spring 1994 television schedule on abc presented the only run of a television series executive producer by bochco , the byrds of paradise . the byrds of paradise showcased a plot structure that was an early forerunner in presenting a more realistic , and not idealized , representation of character arc in the prime time , but it aired for only one season , and has yet to be re-aired on television . although the byrds of paradise achieved significant critical acclaim during its initial run , and helped launch the careers of actors seth green and jennifer love hewitt , the show has never received an official release on any home video or streaming media . other projects in this period that failed to take off include murder one ( 1995–97 ) , brooklyn south ( 1997 ) , city of angels ( 2000 ) , philly ( 2001 ) , and over there ( 2005 ) . all five shows failed to match bochco 's earlier success though murder one and over there garnered critical praise . in 2005 , bochco took charge of commander in chief ( 2005–06 ) , created by rod lurie , and brought in a new writing team . however , in spring 2006 , he left the show because of conflicts with abc , and shortly afterward the program was canceled . bochco described his experience on the show as '' horrible '' . gay , verne .

'' the network executives stay the same age and i keep getting older and it creates a different kind of relationship . when i was doing my stuff at nbc with brandon tartikoff and hill street , we were contemporaries , '' says bochco . '' when i sit down now , they 're sitting in a room with someone who 's old enough to be their father and i 'm not sure they want to sit in a room with their fathers . '' in 2008 , bochco argued that the new home for quality prime time drama is cable , where '' the atmosphere is far friendlier and the creative environment more conducive to doing original work '' , and that '' most of what 's passing for primetime drama these days is n't very good '' . schneider , michael .
