( the paper was submitted in 1975 . ) it is one of the first attempts at creating a quantum information theory , showing that shannon information theory can not directly be generalized to the quantum case , but rather that it is possible to construct a quantum information theory , which is a generalization of shannon 's theory , within the formalism of a generalized quantum mechanics of open systems and a generalized concept of observables ( the so-called semi-observables ) . 1980s . 1980 . paul benioff describes the first quantum mechanical model of a computer . in this work , benioff showed that a computer could operate under the laws of quantum mechanics by describing a schrödinger equation description of turing machines , laying a foundation for further work in quantum computing . the paper was submitted in june 1979 and published in april 1980 . yuri manin briefly motivates the idea of quantum computing tommaso toffoli introduces the reversible toffoli gate , technical report mit/lcs/tm-151 ( 1980 ) and an adapted and condensed version : which , together with the not and xor gates provides a universal set for reversible classical computation . 1980 . at the first conference on the physics of computation , held at mit in may , paul benioff and richard feynman give talks on quantum computing . benioff 's built on his earlier 1980 work showing that a computer can operate under the laws of quantum mechanics . the talk was titled “ quantum mechanical hamiltonian models of discrete processes that erase their own histories : application to turing machines ” . in feynman 's talk , he observed that it appeared to be impossible to efficiently simulate an evolution of a quantum system on a classical computer , and he proposed a basic model for a quantum computer . simulating physics with computers . 1982 . paul benioff further develops his original model of a quantum mechanical turing machine . william wootters and wojciech zurek , and independently dennis dieks rediscover the no-cloning theorem . 1984 . charles bennett and gilles brassard employ wiesner 's conjugate coding for distribution of cryptographic keys . . 1985 . david deutsch , at the university of oxford , describes the first universal quantum computer . just as a universal turing machine can simulate any other turing machine efficiently ( church-turing thesis ) , so the universal quantum computer is able to simulate any other quantum computer with at most a polynomial slowdown . asher peres points out need for quantum error correction schemes and discusses a repetition code for amplitude errors . . 1988 . yoshihisa yamamoto ( scientist ) and k . igeta propose the first physical realization of a quantum computer , including feynman 's cnot gate . k . igeta and y . yamamoto .
