Homeric Hymns

history . the oldest of the hymns were probably written in the seventh century bc , somewhat later than hesiod and the usually accepted date for the writing down of the homeric epics . this still places the older homeric hymns among the oldest monuments of greek literature ; but although most of them were composed in the seventh and sixth centuries , a few may be hellenistic , and the hymn to ares might be a late pagan work , inserted when it was observed that a hymn to ares was lacking . walter burkert has suggested that the hymn to apollo , attributed by an ancient source to cynaethus of chios ( a member of the homeridae ) , was composed in 522 bc for performance at the unusual double festival held by polycrates of samos to honor apollo of delos and of delphi . walter burkert . 'kynaithos , polycrates and the homeric hymn to apollo ' in arktouros : hellenic studies presented to b . m . w . knox ed . g . w . bowersock , w . burkert , m . c . j . putnam ( berlin : de gruyter , 1979 ) pp . 53–62 . the hymns , which must be the remains of a once more strongly represented genre , vary widely in length , some being as brief as three or four lines , while others are in excess of five hundred lines . the long ones comprise an invocation , praise , and narrative , sometimes quite extended . in the briefest ones , the narrative element is lacking . the longer ones show signs of having been assembled from pre-existing disparate materials . most surviving byzantine manuscripts begin with the third hymn . a chance discovery in moscow in 1777 recovered the two hymns that open the collection , the fragmentary to dionysus and to demeter ( complete save some lacunose lines ) , in a single fifteenth-century manuscript . some at least of the shorter ones may be excerpts that have omitted the narrative central section , preserving only the useful invocation and introduction , '' husks , introductions and conclusions from which the narrative core has been removed '' as robert parker calls them , '' the 'hymn to demeter ' and the 'homeric hymns ' '' greece & rome 2nd series 38.1 ( april 1991 , pp . 1–17 ) p . 1 . parker notes that , for instance , hymn 18 preserves a version of the beginning and end of the hymn to hermes . which a rhapsode could employ in the manner of a prelude . the thirty-three hymns praise most of the major gods of greek mythology ; at least the shorter ones may have served as preludes to the recitation of epic verse at festivals by professional rhapsodes : often the singer concludes by saying that now he will pass to another song . a thirty-fourth , to hosts is not a hymn , but a reminder that xenia ( greek ) enjoined by the gods , a pointed reminder when coming from a professional rhapsode . list of the homeric hymns .
