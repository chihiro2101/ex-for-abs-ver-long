Westminster School

sport ( '' station '' ) . the school has three eton fives courts behind ashburnham house . the school frequently fields pupils as national entries in international competitions in rowing , or '' water '' , and fencing . westminster school boat club is one of the oldest rowing clubs in the world , located on the river thames . the oxford university boat club uses westminster 's boathouse at putney as its hq for the annual the boat race on the thames . the boathouse was remodelled in 1997 and won a wandsworth design award in 1999 . the school 's colour is pink ; westminster rowers raced eton college for the right to wear the colour . prospectus , p . 20 . '' in 1837 there was a boat race against eton in which each school chose their colours – westminster chose pink which remains the school 's colour to this day . '' one story goes that , at one annual eton-westminster rowing race , both crews arrived wearing pink , which was fashionable at the time . the eton crew bought some light-blue ribbon ( which later became the standard eton colours ) to differentiate themselves , but the westminster crew won the race and the right to wear pink in perpetuity . the premier leander club at henley , founded in london by a number of old westminster rowers , later adopted it , although they call the colour cerise . the only problems arise when racing against abingdon school , whose team also wears pink . since 1810 , when the head master , william vincent , fenced off and ordered the ploughing of the waste marshlands known as tothill fields for use by the school , which were being threatened by london 's urban sprawl , the school 's main sports ground has been nearby at vincent square , with football and cricket on the main area and tennis and netball on the courts ; it also hosts a playground for westminster under school . at 13 acres , it is the largest private , open green space in central london , despite this , it is not large enough for all pupils doing these sports to use simultaneously the three football pitches and typically one smaller practise pitch become one main cricket square and several smaller practise squares for the cricket season . so the school hires and owns other sporting facilities near the school . these include the oldest boating club in the world , an astroturf ground in battersea , and the queen mother sports centre , home to a variety of sports . '' green '' ( dean 's yard ) is also used , as are the two school gyms , one in the abbey cloisters and one in the weston building , and the three eton fives courts in ashburnham garden , the garden behind ashburnham house . westminster played in the first school cricket match against charterhouse school in 1794 the earliest school match and from 1796 played cricket against eton . westminster has an historic joint claim to a major role in developing association football , . during the 1840s at both westminster and charterhouse , pupils ' surroundings meant they were confined to playing their football in the cloisters , making the rough and tumble of the handling game that was developing at other schools such as rugby impossible , and necessitating a new code of rules . during the formulation of the rules of association football in the 1860s , representatives of westminster school and charterhouse also pushed for a passing game , in particular rules that allowed forward passing ( '' passing on '' ) . other schools ( in particular eton college , harrow , and shrewsbury school ) favoured a dribbling game with a tight off-side rule . by 1867 the football association had chosen in favour of the westminster and charterhouse game and adopted an off-side rule that permitted forward passing . morris marples , a history of football , secker and warburg , london 1954 , p . 50 . fifa.com – football rules are brilliant ! the modern forward-passing game was a direct consequence of westminster and charterhouse football . head masters . other notable masters . nick bevan ( rowing coach , later headmaster of shiplake college ) . controversies . between 2001 and 2004 , the school was one of fifty independent schools involved in the independent school fee fixing scandal in the united kingdom . it was subsequently found guilty of operating a fee-fixing cartel by the office of fair trading . the commission argued that until 2000 , the practice had been legal , and that the commission had not been aware of the change to the law . . notable alumni . the following people were educated at westminster , of about 900 listed in the oxford dictionary of national biography :
