high cost of bread due to the corn laws . sullington seems to have been particularly hard hit . emigration was encouraged throughout west sussex to relieve the parishes of the burden of excessive poor relief . “ the gallop brothers were among those who chose australia instead of america : '' west australia was still very much in the pioneering stage . letters from emigrants to their friends and relations in this neighbourhood give the impression that those who sailed to america , provided they were not afraid to work , had an easier life than those who took the greater risk and went to australia '' . . politics . gallop was elected to the western australian legislative assembly for the seat of victoria park in 1986 . from 1990 to 1993 , during the lawrence labor government , gallop
