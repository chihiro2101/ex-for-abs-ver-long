Overprint

surcharges . the term '' surcharge '' in philately describes any type of overprint that alters the price of a stamp . williams & williams , p . 258 . surcharges raise or lower the face value of existing stamps when prices have changed too quickly to produce an appropriate new issue , or simply to use up surplus stocks . any overprint which restates a stamp 's face value in a new currency is also described as a surcharge . some postal systems have resorted to surcharge overprints when converting to a new national monetary system , such as sierra leone did when the british commonwealth converted to decimal currency in the 1960s . stamps have occasionally been overprinted multiple times . a famous example of repeated surcharging happened during the inflation in the weimar republic . prices rose so fast and dramatically that postage stamps which cost five or ten pfennigs in 1920 were overprinted for sale in the values of thousands , millions , and eventually billions of marks . file : uk-stamp-1873-pennystamp overprinted to halfpenny.jpg victoria , 1873 : penny stamp overprinted to new value of halfpenny . file : guatemala 1881 sc17.jpg guatemala 1881 : 1 centavo surcharge on 1/4 real file : ceylon-uk-stamp-1888-double-inverted-surcharge.jpg ceylon , 1888 : stamp surcharged by a '' double inverted '' overprint . file : uruguay 1892 sc100.jpg uruguay , 1892 : 1c provisional surcharge on 20c issue of 1889-1901 . file : stamp siberia 1919 50k.jpg russia , 1919 : tsarist 3-kopeck overprinted to new value of 50 kopecks for use in siberia . image : germany278.jpg germany , 1923 : five thousand mark value overprinted to two million . . commemorative overprints . overprints have often been used as commemoratives , providing a faster and lower-cost alternative to designing and issuing special stamps or postmarks . the united states , which historically has issued relatively few commemorative overprints , did this in 1928 for issues celebrating molly pitcher and the discovery of hawaii . british stamps heralding the 1966 fifa world cup were reissued after england 's victory with the overprint '' england winners '' . similarly , guyana issued a set of 32 stamps showing team pictures of all the participants in the 1998 world cup – after the tournament eight of these were reissued with an overprint announcing france 's win . in some rare cases , commemorative overprints have been applied to souvenir sheets . when these postal commodities are overprinted , they are always very carefully positioned for aesthetic appeal , usually on the blank outer border ( '' selvage '' ) of the paper . file : uk-hong-kong-stamp-1891-overprint 50-year-jubilee.jpg hong kong , 1891 : definitive postage stamp overprinted to commemorate the 50th anniversary of british administration . file : molly pitcher stamp.jpg united states , 1928 : the mythic american revolutionary war hero '' molly pitcher '' was honored with an overprint . file:1935 cpa 514 stamp of ussr sanfrancisco.jpg soviet union , 1935 : aviator sigizmund levanevsky with red overprint for his north pole flight , aug . 1935 . also includes 1 rouble surcharge . file : timbre tanger uksurch 2-6 1957.jpg great britain , 1957 : for use in uk postal agencies in morocco , commemorating the centenary of the british postal office in tangier . . change of function overprints . regular stamps were also overprinted to indicate exclusive usage for a special function or combination of functions ; intended for airmail , official mail , newspapers , postage due , special delivery , telegraph and so on . the official stamps of some countries like great britain had an overprint which defined the specific official usage ; for revenue stamp , government parcels , office of works , military , admiralty , war tax ( see below ) . the opposite occurs as well , in this case special function stamps are overprinted to serve as regular stamps . 1899 malta 5s revenue stamp.jpg malta , 1899 : 5s , 1886 issue , overprinted 'revenue ' . 1900 british army telegraphs stamp.jpg great britain , 1900 : british 1/2d stamp overprinted 'army telegraphs ' . nicaragua 1901 sc153 used.jpg nicaragua , 1901 : a postage due stamp overprinted for use as regular stamp . briefmarken flugpost 1918.jpg austria , 1918 : austro-hungarian empire stamps overprinted 'flugpost ' for airmail . also surcharged . stamp soviet union 1924 d1a.jpg soviet union , 1924 : regular 1918 issue overprinted 'doplata ' for postal duty . also 1 kopeck surcharge . stamp uk mef 1942 2p.jpg great britain , 1942 : british 2d stamp overprinted 'm.e.f . ' ( 'middle eastern forces ' ) , for military use . . security measures . overprints have been used as security measures to deter misuse and theft . williams & williams , p . 253 . in the nineteenth century , mexico was plagued by thefts of stamps on their way to remote post offices . to address this , stamps were shipped from mexico city to the local districts where they were overprinted with the district name – they were not valid for postage without the overprint . in el salvador a significant quantity of stamps was stolen from the san salvador post office in 1874 . as a result all remaining stock was officially overprinted 'contrasello ' preventing usage of the non-overprinted stamps . the united states used a similar strategy to deal with thefts in kansas and nebraska in 1929 , overprinting the current definitive stamp with '' kans . '' and '' nebr . '' before they were shipped from washington , to make it more difficult to sell stolen stamps outside the indicated state . file : stamp mexico 1864 1r eagle.jpg mexico , 1856 : guanajuato district

faster than anticipated changing postal rates , changes in currency or other reasons they ran out of stamps , and demand had to be met . some overprints were used to establish the first stage of postal service in a new territorial possession or colony however . if preparations had not been made , the controlling nation 's regular homeland stamps would be overprinted with a local name , local currency or 'abroad ' indication . in a similar fashion a nation 's domestic stamps may be overprinted for use in foreign post offices under that power 's control . for example , from 1919-22 the united states overprinted 18 postage stamps at double value and marked for its office in shanghai , china . italy estero 1874 sc10.jpg italy 1874 : overprinted 'estero ' ( abroad ) for use in the

provisional overprints . provisional stamps are postage issue made for temporary ad hoc usage to meet demands until regular issues are reintroduced . . transitional government overprints . new states or states in transition have sometimes found it necessary to recirculate stocks of stamps printed by a previous government . some historical perspective may be gleaned from the study of such stamps : some transitional government overprints blend neatly with their predecessors ' designs , while others attempt to totally obscure or even deface the older markings . in several european nations in 1944-45 , nazi occupational stamps were overprinted for the provisional governments , and those which depicted adolf hitler were most heavily overprinted , obliterating his face . file :

times of war , many nations have issued war tax stamps . before new stamps could be printed , older stamps were frequently overprinted with surcharges or a simple inscription such as '' war tax '' . in actual combat zones , the replenishment of stamp stocks is generally low on a military 's list of priorities . in contested or occupied areas , captured local stamps are often expediently overprinted by the occupying forces . file : deutsches reich - belgien.jpg belgium , world war i : german postage stamp overprinted with '' belgium '' for use during the german occupation . file :

commonwealth occupation force in japan . . precancels . any stamp that is cancelled by postal authorities before it is sold is described as '' precancelled '' : reinfeld , p.37 . the precancellation mark is an overprint . this is usually only done when stamps are sold in large bulk quantities to businesses or other large organizations : the postal service will save the labor of cancelling each individual stamp by precancelling the entire purchased quantity . williams & williams , p . 257 . the overprints also help prevent theft or misuse because they usually include the name of the city or region in which they are to be used . unlike standard cancellation marks , they usually do not give a specific date , affording the bulk purchaser time to use them at their discretion . in some situations , however , months or years may be included in the overprint to indicate an expiration . precancels for official government use are fastidiously prepared , but other kinds are almost always '' heavy cancels '' which deliberately obliterate much of a stamp 's design . for this reason , precancelled stamps are usually left unrepresented in stamp collectings . since the 1980s , many modern postal systems no longer use overprints to indicate bulk purchases . bulk mail is franked using barcodes on pre-printed envelopes or on blank adhesive labels . the usps introduced a intelligent mail barcode in 2011 . file : stampcanadapréobarvictoria1870-t35i.png canada , 1870 : early heavy cancel for bulk purchase . file : franceprecancel5cparis1920.jpg france , 1920 : bulk postage precancel marked for paris . file : stamp us 1938 2c precancel.jpg united states , 1938 : business precancel marked for new york city . . private overprints . any overprint that does not originate from a stamp-issuing authority is considered a private overprint or private cancellation . such overprints almost always invalidate a stamp for postal use . most countries treat unofficial overprints the same way the united states post office does : the usps domestic mail manual states that stamps '' overprinted with an unauthorized design , message or other marking '' are not valid for postage . private overprints generally remain outside the formal realm of philately , although individual issues can achieve notoriety through their popularity or aesthetic appeal . private overprints are typically political messages or commercial promotion , but can also originate from speculative philatelic purposes produced deliberately with a view to selling them to unsuspecting collectors . stamps owned by commercial entities have sometimes privately overprinted the backs of their purchased stamps . these overprints are usually made as control marks or accounting information . such overprinting does not invalidate a stamp unless it shows through the front . file : suriname fake overprint 1873 n3.jpg suriname , 1873 : a private speculative surcharge . file : moquette ovp nvph7.jpg dutch east indies , 1881 : moquette private overprint . file : ixleipzigerbriefmarken-handlermessecentraltheater1926-2.jpg germany , 1926 : a private commercial overprint . . specimen overprints . some stamps are never valid for postal use . they are made for use in promotional displays or as reference material by postal authorities and the universal postal union ( upu ) . still others are manufactured by printers for color matching throughout successive printings . in all such cases , the stamps will display the word '' specimen '' ( or '' cancelled '' ) on its face . occasionally , the word may be uniquely handwritten by a postal authority or , much more elaborately , punched through the stamp paper in a method known as perfin . most often , though , specimen markings are applied as a prominent overprint . colombia 1888 sc137 muestra.jpg colombia , 1888 : overprinted muest ( ra ) ( sp . ) . stamp-natal 1902 £20 green.jpg natal , 1902 : specimen for a £20 stamp . australia-1924 specimen stamp overprint.tif australia , 1924 : specimen overprint . . overprints on currency . the design and printing of valid paper currency is rarely done hastily and overprints are extremely rare , but in times of crisis such measures have been taken . after world war i , the various successor states of the austro-hungarian empire made multilingual overprints to their old imperial currency until new notes could be designed and circulated . currency overprints were also used during world war ii to mark all united states dollars in the hawaiian islands . these hawaii overprint notes were made in case the islands were captured and the invading forces gained control of the money . the haitian gourde was overprinted after the unexpectedly rapid fall of the baby doc duvalier regime . the overprint consisted of a red circle with a slash across it with the date of the end of the duvalier regime ( 7 & nbsp ; february 1986 ) printed below in red . the brusque symbol obscured the images of baby doc and papa doc until they were replaced with images of figures from haitian history . something similar was done in iran in 1979 when the shah 's picture was covered by an intricate design . file :
