Shock absorber

description . pneumatic and hydraulic shock absorbers are used in conjunction with cushions and springs . an automobile shock absorber contains spring-loaded check valves and orifices to control the flow of oil through an internal piston ( see below ) . , horst bauer ( ed ) . , automotive handbook 4th edition , robert bosch gmbh , 1996 , , page 584 one design consideration , when designing or choosing a shock absorber , is where that energy will go . in most shock absorbers , energy is converted to heat inside the viscous fluid . in hydraulic cylinders , the hydraulic fluid heats up , while in air cylinders , the hot air is usually exhausted to the atmosphere . in other types of shock absorbers , such as electromagnetic types , the dissipated energy can be stored and used later . in general terms , shock absorbers help cushion vehicles on uneven roads . vehicle suspension . in a vehicle , shock absorbers reduce the effect of traveling over rough ground , leading to improved ride quality and vehicle handling . while shock absorbers serve the purpose of limiting excessive suspension movement , their intended sole purpose is to damp spring oscillations . shock absorbers use valving of oil and gasses to absorb excess energy from the springs . spring rates are chosen by the manufacturer based on the weight of the vehicle , loaded and unloaded . some people use shocks to modify spring rates but this is not the correct use . along with hysteresis in the tire itself , they damp the energy stored in the motion of the unsprung weight up and down . effective wheel bounce damping may require tuning shocks to an optimal resistance . spring-based shock absorbers commonly use coil springs or leaf springs , though torsion bars are used in torsional shocks as well . ideal springs alone , however , are not shock absorbers , as springs only store and do not dissipate or absorb energy . vehicles typically employ both hydraulic shock absorbers and springs or torsion bars . in this combination , '' shock absorber '' refers specifically to the hydraulic piston that absorbs and dissipates vibration . now , composite suspension system are used mainly in 2 wheelers and also leaf spring are made up of composite material in 4 wheelers . early history . in common with carriages and railway locomotives , most early motor vehicles used leaf springs . one of the features of these springs was that the friction between the leaves offered a degree of damping , and in a 1912 review of vehicle suspension , the lack of this characteristic in helical springs was the reason it was '' impossible '' to use them as main springs . '' springs - a simple study of car suspension '' , the automotor journal , august 10th , 1912 , pp936-937 however the amount of damping provided by leaf spring friction was limited and variable according to the conditions of the springs , and whether wet or dry . it also operated in both directions . motorcycle front suspension adopted coil sprung druid forks from about 1906 , and similar designs later added rotary friction dampers , which damped both ways - but they were adjustable ( e.g . 1924 webb forks ) . these friction disk shock absorbers were also fitted to many cars . one of the problems with motor cars was the large variation in sprung weight between lightly loaded and fully loaded , especially for the rear springs . when heavily loaded the springs could bottom out , and apart from fitting rubber 'bump stops ' , there were attempts to use heavy main springs with auxiliary springs to smooth the ride when lightly loaded , which were often called 'shock absorbers ' . realising that the spring and vehicle combination bounced with a characteristic frequency , these auxiliary springs were designed with a different period , but were not a solution to the problem that the spring rebound after striking a bump could throw you out of your seat . what was called for was damping that operated on the rebound . although c.l . horock came up with a design in 1901 that had hydraulic damping , it worked in one direction only . it does not seem to have gone into production right away , whereas mechanical dampers such as the gabriel snubber started being fitted in the late 1900s ( also the similar stromberg anti-shox ) . these used a belt coiled inside a device such that it freely wound in under the action of a coiled spring , but met friction when drawn out . gabriel snubbers were fitted to an 11.9hp arrol-johnston car which broke the 6 hour class b record at brooklands in late 1912 , and the automotor journal noted that this snubber might have a great future for racing due to its light weight and easy fitment . '' some accessories to see at olympia '' , the automotor journal , nov 2nd , 1912 , p1284 one of the earliest hydraulic dampers to go into production was the telesco shock absorber , exhibited at the 1912 olympia motor show and marketed by polyrhoe carburettors ltd . this contained a spring inside the telescopic unit like the pure spring type 'shock absorbers ' mentioned above , but also oil and an internal valve so that the oil damped in the rebound direction . the telesco unit was fitted at the rear end of the leaf spring , in place of the rear spring to chassis mount , so that it formed part of the springing system , albeit a hydraulically damped part . '' what a chauffeur expects to see at olympia '' , the automotor journal , nov 9th 1912 , p1313 this layout was presumably selected as it was easy to apply to existing vehicles , but it meant the hydraulic damping was not applied to the action of the main leaf spring , but only to the action of the auxiliary spring in the unit itself . the first production hydraulic dampers to act on the main leaf spring movement were probably those based on an original concept by maurice houdaille patented in 1908 and 1909 . these used a lever arm which moved hydraulically damped vanes inside the unit . the main advantage over the friction disk dampers was that it would resist sudden movement but allow slow movement , whereas the rotary friction dampers tended to stick and then offer the same resistance regardless of speed of movement . there appears to have been little progress on commercialising the lever arm shock absorbers until after world war i , after which they came into widespread use , for example as standard equipment on the 1927 ford model a and manufactured by ralph peo career of buffalo , ny . types of vehicle shock absorbers . most vehicular shock absorbers are either twin-tube or mono-tube types with some variations on these themes . twin-tube . . basic twin-tube . also known as a '' two-tube '' shock absorber , this device consists of two nested cylindrical tubes , an inner tube that is called the '' working tube '' or the '' pressure tube '' , and an outer tube called the '' reserve tube '' . at the bottom of the device on the inside is a compression valve or base valve . when the piston is forced up or down by bumps in the road , hydraulic fluid moves between different chambers via small holes or '' orifices '' in the piston and via the valve , converting the '' shock '' energy into heat which must then be dissipated . twin-tube gas charged . variously known as a '' gas cell two-tube '' or similarly-named design , this variation represented a significant advancement over the basic twin-tube form . its overall structure is very similar to the twin-tube , but a low-pressure charge of nitrogen gas is added to the reserve tube . the result of this alteration is a dramatic reduction in '' foaming '' or '' aeration '' , the undesirable outcome of a twin-tube overheating and failing which presents as foaming hydraulic fluid dripping out of the assembly . twin-tube gas charged shock absorbers represent the vast majority of original modern vehicle suspensions installations . position sensitive damping . often abbreviated simply as '' psd '' , this design is another evolution of the twin-tube shock . in a psd shock absorber , which still consists of two nested tubes and still contains nitrogen gas , a set of grooves has been added to the pressure tube . these grooves allow the piston to move relatively freely in the middle range of travel ( i.e . , the most common street or highway use , called by engineers the '' comfort zone '' ) and to move with significantly less freedom in response to shifts to more irregular surfaces when upward and downward movement of the piston starts to occur with greater intensity ( i.e . , on bumpy sections of roadsâ€” the stiffening gives the driver greater control of movement over the vehicle so its range on either side of the comfort zone is called the '' control zone '' ) . this advance allowed car designers to make a shock absorber tailored to specific makes and models of vehicles and to take into account a given vehicle 's size and weight , its maneuverability , its horsepower , etc . in creating a correspondingly effective shock . acceleration sensitive damping . the next phase in shock absorber evolution was the development of a shock absorber that could sense and respond to not just situational changes from '' bumpy '' to '' smooth '' but to individual bumps in the road in a near instantaneous reaction . this was achieved through a change in the design of the compression valve , and has been termed '' acceleration sensitive damping '' or '' asd '' . not only does this result in a complete disappearance of the '' comfort vs . control '' tradeoff , it also reduced pitch during vehicle braking and roll during turns . however , asd shocks are usually only available as aftermarket changes to a vehicle and are only available from a limited number of manufacturers . coilover . coilover shock absorbers are usually a kind of twin-tube gas charged shock absorber inside the helical road spring . they are common on motorcycle and scooter rear suspensions , and widely used on front and rear suspensions in cars . mono-tube . thumb left the principal design alternative to the twin-tube form has been the mono-tube shock absorber which was considered a revolutionary advancement when it appeared in the 1950s . as its name implies , the mono-tube shock , which is also a gas-pressurized shock and also comes in a coilover format , consists of only one tube , the pressure tube , though it has two pistons . these pistons are called the working piston and the dividing or floating piston , and they move in relative synchrony inside the pressure tube in response to changes in road smoothness . the two pistons also completely separate the shock 's fluid and gas components . the mono-tube shock absorber is consistently a much longer overall design than the twin-tubes , making it difficult to mount in passenger cars designed for twin-tube shocks . however , unlike the twin-tubes , the mono-tube shock can be mounted either wayâ€” it does not have any directionality . it also does not have a compression valve , whose role has been taken up by the dividing piston , and although it contains nitrogen gas , the gas in a mono-tube shock is under high pressure ( 260-360 p.s.i . or so ) which can actually help it to support some of the vehicle 's weight , something which no other shock absorber is designed to do . mercedes became the first auto manufacturer to install mono-tube shocks as standard equipment on some of their cars starting in 1958 . they were manufactured by bilstein , patented the design and first appeared in 1954s . shelton , p.24 and p.26 caption . because the design was patented , no other manufacturer could use it until 1971 when the patent expired . . spool valve . spool valve dampers are characterized by the use of hollow cylindrical sleeves with machined-in oil passages as opposed to traditional conventional flexible discs or shims . spool valving can be applied with monotube , twin-tube , and/or position-sensitive packaging , and is compatible with electronic control . primary among benefits cited in multimatic â€™ s 2010 patent filing is the elimination of performance ambiguity associated with flexible shims , resulting in mathematically predictable , repeatable , and robust pressure-flow characteristics . . theoretical approaches . there are several commonly used principles behind shock absorption : hysteresis of structural material , for example the compression of rubber disks , stretching of rubber bands and cords , bending of steel springs , or twisting of torsion bars . hysteresis is the tendency for otherwise elastic materials to rebound with less force than was required to deform them . simple vehicles with no separate shock absorbers are damped , to some extent , by the hysteresis of their springs and frames . dry friction as used in wheel brakes , by using disks ( classically made of leather ) at the pivot of a lever , with friction forced by springs . used in early automobiles such as the ford model t , up through some british cars of the 1940s and on the french citroen 2cv in the 1950s . although now considered obsolete , an advantage of this system is its mechanical simplicity ; the degree of damping can be easily adjusted by tightening or loosening the screw clamping the disks , and it can be easily rebuilt with simple hand tools . a disadvantage is that the damping force tends not to increase with the speed of the vertical motion . : solid state , tapered chain shock absorbers , using one or more tapered , axial alignment ( s ) of granular spheres , typically made of metals such as nitinol , in a casing . fluid friction , for example the flow of fluid through a narrow orifice ( hydraulics ) , constitutes the vast majority of automotive shock absorbers . this design first appeared on mors racing cars in 1902 . setright , l . j . k . '' dampers : smoothing out the bumps '' , in northey , tom , ed . world of automobiles ( london : orbis , 1974 ) , volume 5 , p.490 . one advantage of this type is , by using special internal valving , the absorber may be made relatively soft to compression ( allowing a soft response to a bump ) and relatively stiff to extension , controlling '' rebound '' , which is the vehicle response to energy stored in the springs ; similarly , a series of valves controlled by springs can change the degree of stiffness according to the velocity of the impact or rebound . specialized shock absorbers for racing purposes may allow the front end of a dragster to rise with minimal resistance under acceleration , then strongly resist letting it settle , thereby maintaining a desirable rearward weight distribution for enhanced traction . : compression of a gas , for example pneumatic shock absorbers , which can act like springs as the air pressure is building to resist the force on it . enclosed gas is compressible , so equipment is less subject to shock damage . this concept was first applied in series production on citroÃ«n cars in 1954 . today , many shock absorbers are pressurized with compressed nitrogen , to reduce the tendency for the oil to cavitate under heavy use . this causes foaming which temporarily reduces the damping ability of the unit . in very heavy duty units used for racing or off-road use , there may even be a secondary cylinder connected to the shock absorber to act as a reservoir for the oil and pressurized gas . in aircraft landing gear , air shock absorbers may be combined with hydraulic damping to reduce bounce . such struts are called oleo struts ( combining oil and air ) inertial resistance to acceleration , the citroÃ«n 2cv had shock absorbers that damp wheel bounce with no external moving parts . these consisted of a spring-mounted 3.5 & nbsp ; kg ( 7.75 & nbsp ; lb ) iron weight inside a vertical cylinder and are similar to , yet much smaller than versions of the tuned mass dampers used on tall buildings . composite hydropneumatic suspension combines many suspension elements in a single device : spring action , shock absorption , ride-height control , and self leveling suspension . this combines the advantages of gas compressibility and the ability of hydraulic machinery to apply force multiplication . conventional shock absorbers can be combined with air suspension springs - an alternate way to achieve ride-height control , and self leveling suspension . in an electrorheological fluid damper , an electric field changes the viscosity of the oil . this principle allows semi-active damper applications in automotive and various industries . magnetic field variation : a magneto rheological damper changes its fluid characteristics through an electromagnet . the effect of a shock absorber at high ( sound ) frequencies is usually limited by using a compressible gas as the working fluid or mounting it with rubber bushings . special features . some shock absorbers allow tuning of the ride via control of the valve by a manual adjustment provided at the shock absorber . in more expensive vehicles the valves may be remotely adjustable , offering the driver control of the ride at will while the vehicle is operated . additional control can be provided by dynamic valve control via computer in response to sensors , giving both a smooth ride and a firm suspension when needed , allowing height adjustable suspension . ride height control is especially desirable in highway vehicles intended for occasional rough road use , as a means of improving handling and reducing aerodynamic drag by lowering the vehicle when operating on improved high speed roads . shock absorber vs struts . unlike the shock absorber , the strut has a reinforced body and stem ; strut already plays the role of shocks absorbers , so the shock absorber may well act as part of the strut , not the other way around struts is subjected to multidirectional loads , while the shock absorber only damps vibrations and receive an impact along its axis ; the strut gives to the car greater reliability ; strut and shock absorber have a different way of attachment . shock absorbers are mounted through silent blocks without a swivel device and are equipped with a small diameter rod . strut replaces the upper ball and rotator .
