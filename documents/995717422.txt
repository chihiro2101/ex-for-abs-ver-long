The Action

career . the band was formed as the boys in august 1963 , in kentish town , nw postcode area . the original members were reg king ( lead vocals ) , alan 'bam ' king ( rhythm guitar , vocals ) , mike '' ace '' evans ( bass guitar , vocals ) and roger powell ( drums ) . they had a brief spell as a bar band in germany , and then as a backing band for sandra barry , ( sometimes referred to as sandra barry and the boyfriends ) playing on her single '' really gon na shake '' in 1964 . after the stint with barry , pete watson was recruited as lead guitarist , and in 1964 they changed their name to the action . shortly after their name change , they signed to parlophone with producer george martin . '' land of a thousand dances '' b/w '' in my lonely room '' was well received by critics , but sold poorly . none of the action 's singles achieved success in the uk singles chart . dissatisfied with the stewardship of their manager rikki farr , pete watson left the band in late 1966 . the action continued as a quartet but were dropped by parlophone in mid-1967 , by which time they had also parted ways with rikki farr . they then assumed control of their own affairs , and soon afterwards keyboardist ian whiteman joined the band in an effort to expand their sound in order to help secure a new recording contract . by november , guitarist martin stone had also joined the band . the action now set about gathering original new material for a projected lp , but recording demos in a radically different byrds-influenced psychedelic style failed to secure them their hoped-for recording deal ( the 1967/68 demos were eventually released in the 1990s under the title rolled gold ) . with the band seemingly having reached an impasse vocalist reg king 's behaviour became increasing unpredictable , and he departed the band in mid-1968 . king 's exit left ian whiteman and alan king to share vocal duties , and at this point the action decided on a brief change of name to azoth . however the band soon reverted to their old name to record a new set of five demos , where they moved toward a more mid-tempo west coast-influenced psychedelic ballad style and then into folk rock ( these demos were eventually released in 1985 as the action speaks louder than words ) . by january 1969 however , upon signing to head records ( a fledgling independent label run by their former roadie john curd ) , the action was finally and permanently re-christened mighty baby . alan king later went on to form ace , who had a us hit in 1975 with “ how long ” . a 1980 compilation of the action 's parlophone tracks came with sleeve notes by paul weller ( '' the action had it in their soul '' ) and did much for their profile , while the rolled gold album demos were hailed as lost classics when they were reissued in the 1990s . in 1998 , the original lineup of the action reformed for a concert on the isle of wight . the band then played regularly over the next six years . they are one of the favourite bands of phil collins , who performed with the reunited band in june 2000 . '' for me it was like playing with the beatles '' , he later commented on the experience . . discography . singles . ; as sandra barry and the boys : '' really gon na shake '' / '' when we get married '' ( r . king ) ( march 1964 , decca ) ; as the boys : '' it ai n't fair '' ( r . king/evans ) / '' i want you '' ( r . king/evans ) ( november 1964 , pye ) ; as the action : '' land of a thousand dances '' b/w '' in my lonely room '' ( holland-dozier-holland ) ( october 1965 , parlophone ) '' i 'll keep holding on '' / '' hey sah-lo-ney '' ( february 1966 , parlophone ) '' baby , you 've got it '' ( mcallister , vail ) / '' since i lost my baby '' ( robinson/moore ) ( july 1966 , parlophone ) '' never ever '' ( king/king/evans/powell ) / '' twenty fourth hour '' ( king/king/evans/powell ) ( february 1967 , parlophone ) '' shadows and reflections '' ( larry marks/tandyn almer ) / '' something has hit me '' ( king/jones ) ( june 1967 , parlophone ) '' harlem shuffle '' / '' was n't it you '' ( goffin/king ) ( 1968 , hansa , germany only ) french ep : '' shadows and reflections '' / '' something has hit me '' / '' never ever '' / '' twenty fourth hour '' ( odeon ( moe 149 ) , 1967 ) . compilation albums . ; the ultimate ! action : ( singles and other material recorded by the original run of the band , 1964–1967 ) '' i 'll keep holding on '' '' harlem shuffle '' '' never ever '' '' twenty fourth hour '' '' since i lost my baby '' '' in my lonely room '' '' hey sha-lo-ney '' '' was n't it you ?
