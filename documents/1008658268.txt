Dinitrogen tetroxide

structure and properties . dinitrogen tetroxide could be regarded as two nitro groups ( -no 2 ) bonded together . it forms an equilibrium mixture with nitrogen dioxide . the molecule is planar with an n-n bond distance of 1.78å and n-o distances of 1.19å . the n-n distance corresponds to a weak bond , since it is significantly longer than the average n-n single bond length of 1.45å . unlike no 2 , n 2 o 4 is diamagnetic since it has no unpaired electrons . holleman , a . f . ; wiberg , e .

'' cool '' dinitrogen tetroxide is compressed and heated , causing it to dissociate into nitrogen dioxide at half the molecular weight . this hot nitrogen dioxide is expanded through a turbine , cooling it and lowering the pressure , and then cooled further in a heat sink , causing it to recombine into nitrogen tetroxide at the original molecular weight . it is then much easier to compress to start the entire cycle again . such dissociative gas brayton cycles have the potential to considerably increase efficiencies of power conversion equipment . . chemical reactions . intermediate in the manufacture of nitric acid . nitric acid is manufactured on a large scale via n 2 o 4 . this species reacts with water to give both nitrous acid and nitric acid : : n 2 o 4 + h 2 o → hno 2 + hno 3 the coproduct hno 2 upon heating disproportionates to no and more nitric acid . when exposed to oxygen , no is converted back into nitrogen dioxide : : 2 no + o 2 → 2 no 2 the resulting no 2 and n 2 o 4 can be returned to the cycle to give the mixture of nitrous and nitric acids again . synthesis of metal nitrates . n 2 o 4 behaves as the salt no + no 3 − , the former being a strong oxidant : : 2 n 2 o 4 + m → 2 no + m ( no 3 ) 2 where m cu , zn , or sn . if metal nitrates are prepared from n 2 o 4 in completely anhydrous conditions , a range of covalent metal nitrates can be formed with many transition metals . this is because there is a thermodynamic preference for the nitrate ion to bond covalently with such metals rather than form an ionic structure . such compounds must be prepared in anhydrous conditions , since the nitrate ion is a much weaker ligand than water , and if water is present the simple hydrated nitrate will form . the anhydrous nitrates concerned are themselves covalent , and many , e.g . anhydrous copper nitrate , are volatile at room temperature . anhydrous titanium nitrate sublimes in vacuum at only 40 & nbsp ; °c . many of the anhydrous transition metal nitrates have striking colours . this branch of chemistry was developed by cliff addison and norman logan at the university of nottingham in the uk during the 1960s and 1970s when highly efficient desiccants and dry box started to become available . references . external links . international chemical safety card 0930 national pollutant inventory – oxides of nitrogen fact sheet niosh pocket guide to chemical hazards : nitrogen tetroxide air liquide gas encyclopedia : no 2 / n 2 o 4
