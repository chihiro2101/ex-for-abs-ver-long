Erasure

history . origins . as a teenager , vince clarke was inspired to make electronic music after hearing wirral synth band orchestral manoeuvres in the dark ( an influence on erasure 's work ) . he became a founding member of depeche mode and the sole writer of their first three singles , including the breakthrough top 10 hit '' just ca n't get enough '' . after leaving the band in late 1981 , clarke forged a similarly notable career with the duo yazoo ( known as yaz in the united states ) . after two hit albums in as many years ( 1982–1983 ) , he split with yazoo partner alison moyet and formed the short-lived project the assembly with producer eric radcliffe . the project spawned a uk number four hit single , '' never never '' , featuring feargal sharkey on vocals . clarke then released another single with vocalist paul quinn , '' one day '' . it flopped , leading clarke to place an advertisement in melody maker looking for a vocalist for a new musical project . peterborough-born andy bell phoned and got a call back a few days later . bell practiced for the audition listening to alison moyet , siouxsie and the banshees and the communards . it went well , and he was chosen . clarke had been his hero . . first recordings and international success : 1985–1994 . left erasure 's first three singles were commercial failures in the uk , although the third , '' oh l'amour '' , charted well in australia and a few european countries ( especially in france , where it still remains erasure 's only hit to date , and germany where it was a top 16 success ) . their debut album , wonderland , was mostly recorded in 1985 and released in june 1986 . although it only made the uk top 75 , it made a sizeable mark in germany , making the top 20 . it was with the release of their fourth single , '' sometimes '' , that erasure finally received recognition in the uk in late 1986 . the song peaked at number 2 in the uk and germany and spent many weeks in the uk top 40 , marking the beginning of a long string of major hits for the duo . the single 's parent album , the circus , was released in march 1987 and reached number 6 and turned platinum in the uk with three additional hit singles : '' it does n't have to be '' , '' victim of love '' and '' the circus '' . the album remained on the charts for over a year . erasure 's third album , the innocents , was released in april 1988 . preceded by the top 10 single '' ship of fools '' , the album hit number 1 in the uk on its initial release and returned to the summit a year later , eventually going double platinum . it also turned platinum in the u.s . , generating two top 20 hits in '' chains of love '' and '' a little respect '' . the innocents was the first of five consecutive number 1 albums for erasure in the uk , including the greatest hits compilation pop ! the first 20 hits . in november 1988 , the crackers international ep , led by the song '' stop !
