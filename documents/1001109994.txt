Henri, Count of Chambord

early life . henri d'artois was born on 29 september 1820 , in the pavillon de marsan , a portion of the tuileries palace that still survives in the compound of the louvre palace in paris . his father , the duc de berry , had been assassinated seven months before henri 's birth . at birth , henri was given the title of duc de bordeaux . because of his birth after his father 's death , when the senior male line of the house of bourbon was on the verge of extinction , one of his middle names was dieudonné ( french for '' god-given '' ) . royalists called him '' the miracle child '' . louis xviii was overjoyed , bestowing 35 royal orders to mark the occasion . henri 's birth was a major setback for the duke of orleans ' ambitions to ascend the french throne . during his customary visit to congratulate the newborn 's mother , the duke made such offensive remarks about the baby 's appearance that the lady holding him was brought to tears . . pretender monarch . image : henri d'artois inspecting royal troops.jpg thumb left the young prince henri inspecting the royal guard at rambouillet on 2 august 1830 . on 2 august 1830 , in response to the july revolution , henri 's grandfather , charles x , abdicated , and twenty minutes later charles ' elder son louis antoine , duc d'angoulême , himself renounced his rights , in favour of the young duc de bordeaux . charles x urged his cousin louis philippe of orléans , as lieutenant général du royaume , to proclaim henri as henry v , king of france . louis philippe requested the duc de bordeaux to be brought to paris to have his rights recognized . the duchess of berry was denied to escort her son ; therefore , both the grandfather and the mother refused to leave the child in france . garnier , j .

— the one man without whom the republic could not have been founded . henri died on 24 august 1883 at his residence in frohsdorf , austria , at the age of sixty-two , bringing the louis xv male-only line to an end . he was buried in his grandfather charles x 's crypt in the church of the franciscan kostanjevica monastery in gorizia , then austria , now in the slovenian city of nova gorica . his personal property , including the château de chambord , was left to his nephew , robert i , duke of parma ( son of henri 's late sister ) . henri 's death left the legitimist line of succession distinctly confused . on one hand , henri himself had accepted that the head of the maison de france ( as distinguished from the maison de bourbon ) would be the head of the orléans line , i.e . the comte de paris . this was accepted by many legitimists , and was the default on legal grounds ; the only surviving bourbon line more senior was the spanish branch , which had renounced its right to inherit the throne of france as a condition of the treaty of utrecht . however , many if not most of henri 's supporters , including his widow , chose to disregard his statements and this law , arguing that no one had the right to deny to the senior direct-male-line male bourbon to be the head of the maison de france and thus the legitimate king of france ; the renunciation of the spanish branch is under this interpretation illegitimate and therefore void . thus these legitimists settled on juan , count of montizón , the carlist pretender to the spanish throne ( the salic law having been suspended in spain , the actual king , alfonso xii , was not the senior descendant in the male line ) , as their claimant to the french crown . gallery . image : françois gérard - la duchesse de berry et ses enfants,1822.jpg the duchess of berry and her children by françois gérard , 1822 file : portrait , the duke of bordeaux , dubois-drahonet.jpg the young duke of bordeaux in a military uniform , by alexandre-jean dubois-drahonet , 1828 image : carolina , duchess of berry and her son the duke of bordeaux by françois pascal simon gérard ( 1770-1837 ) . png the duchess of berry and her son by françois gérard , 1828 image : henri d'artois as a child.jpg detail of portrait , c.1830 image : bordeaux , duc de.jpg portrait , c.1833 . honours . : knight of the order of the golden fleece ( 1823 ) '' toison espagnole ( spanish fleece ) - 19th century '' ( in french ) , chevaliers de la toison d'or . retrieved 2018-09-05 . . patrilineal descent . henri 's patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son . patrilineal descent is the principle behind membership in royal houses , as it can be traced back through the generations - which means that if henri were to choose an historically accurate house name it would be robertian , as all his male-line ancestors have been of that house . henri is a member of the house of bourbon , a branch of the capetian dynasty and of the robertians . henri 's patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son . it follows the bourbon , kings of france , and the counts of paris and worms . this line can be traced back more than 1,200 years from robert of hesbaye to the present day , through kings of france & navarre , spain and two-sicilies , dukes of parma and grand-dukes of luxembourg , princes of orléans and emperors of brazil . it is one of the oldest in europe . robert ii of worms and rheingau ( robert of hesbaye ) , 770–807 robert iii of worms and rheingau , 808–834 robert iv the strong , 820–866 robert i of france , 866–923 hugh the great , 895–956 hugh capet , 941–996 robert ii of france , 972–1031 henry i of france , 1008–1060 philip i of france , 1053–1108 louis vi of france , 1081–1137 louis vii of france , 1120–1180 philip ii of france , 1165–1223 louis viii of france , 1187–1226 louis ix of france , 1215–1270 robert , count of clermont , 1256–1317 louis i , duke of bourbon , 1279–1342 james i , count of la marche , 1319–1362 john i , count of la marche , 1344–1393 louis , count of vendôme , 1376–1446 jean viii , count of vendôme , 1428–1478 françois , count of vendôme , 1470–1495 charles de bourbon , duke of vendôme , 1489–1537 antoine of navarre , 1518–1562 henry iv of france , 1553–1610 louis xiii of france , 1601–1643 louis xiv of france , 1638–1715 louis , grand dauphin , 1661–1711 louis , duke of burgundy , 1682–1712 louis xv of france , 1710–1774 louis , dauphin of france , 1729–1765 charles x of france , 1757–1836 charles ferdinand , duke of berry , 1778–1820 henri , count of chambord , 1820–1883 . see also . list of shortest-reigning monarchs . footnotes . further reading . brown , marvin luther . the comte de chambord : the third republic 's uncompromising king . durham , n.c . : , duke university press , 1967 . philippe delorme . henri , comte de chambord , journal ( 1846-1883 ) , carnets inédits . paris : guibert , 2009 .
