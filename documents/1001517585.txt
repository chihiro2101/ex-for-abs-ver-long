Giorgos Seferis

biography . seferis was born in vourla near smyrna in asia minor , ottoman empire ( now i̇zmir , turkey ) . his father , stelios seferiadis , was a lawyer , and later a professor at the university of athens , as well as a poet and translator in his own right . he was also a staunch venizelism and a supporter of the demotic greek language over the formal , official language ( katharevousa ) . both of these attitudes influenced his son . in 1914 the family moved to athens , where seferis completed his secondary school education . he continued his studies in paris from 1918 to 1925 , studying law at the sorbonne . while he was there , in september 1922 , smyrna/izmir was taken by the turkish army after a two-year greek military campaign on anatolian soil . many greeks , including seferis 's family , fled from asia minor . seferis would not visit smyrna again until 1950 ; the sense of being an exile from his childhood home would inform much of seferis 's poetry , showing itself particularly in his interest in the story of odysseus . seferis was also greatly influenced by kavafis , t . s . eliot and ezra pound . he returned to athens in 1925 and was admitted to the royal greek ministry of foreign affairs in the following year . this was the beginning of a long and successful diplomatic career , during which he held posts in england ( 1931–1934 ) and albania ( 1936–1938 ) . he married maria zannou ( 'maro ' ) on april 10 , 1941 on the eve of the german invasion of greece . during the second world war , seferis accompanied the free greek government in exile to crete , egypt , south africa , and italy , and returned to liberated athens in 1944 . he continued to serve in the ministry of foreign affairs and held diplomatic posts in ankara , turkey ( 1948–1950 ) and london ( 1951–1953 ) . he was appointed minister to lebanon , syria , jordan , and iraq ( 1953–1956 ) , and was royal greek ambassador to the united kingdom from 1957 to 1961 , the last post before his retirement in athens . seferis received many honours and prizes , among them honorary doctoral degrees from the universities of cambridge ( 1960 ) , oxford ( 1964 ) , thessaloniki ( 1964 ) , and princeton ( 1965 ) . in 1936 , seferis published a translation of t . s . eliot 's the waste land . cyprus . seferis first visited cyprus in november 1953 . he immediately fell in love with the island , partly because of its resemblance , in its landscape , the mixture of populations , and in its traditions , to his childhood summer home in skala ( urla ) . his book of poems imerologio katastromatos iii was inspired by the island , and mostly written there–bringing to an end a period of six or seven years in which seferis had not produced any poetry . its original title cyprus , where it was ordained for me… ( a quotation from euripides ’ helen in which teucer states that apollo has decreed that cyprus shall be his home ) made clear the optimistic sense of homecoming seferis felt on discovering the island . seferis changed the title in the 1959 edition of his poems . politically , cyprus was entangled in the dispute between the uk , greece and turkey over its international status . over the next few years , seferis made use of his position in the diplomatic service to strive towards a resolution of the cyprus dispute , investing a great deal of personal effort and emotion . this was one of the few areas in his life in which he allowed the personal and the political to mix . seferis described his political principles as '' liberal and democratic or republican . '' . the nobel prize . right in 1963 , seferis was awarded the nobel prize for literature '' for his eminent lyrical writing , inspired by a deep feeling for the hellenic world of culture . '' seferis was the first greek to receive the prize ( followed later by odysseas elytis , who became a nobel laureate in 1979 ) . but in his acceptance speech , seferis chose rather to emphasise his own humanist philosophy , concluding : '' when on his way to thebes oedipus encountered the sphinx , his answer to its riddle was : 'man ' . that simple word destroyed the monster . we have many monsters to destroy . let us think of the answer of oedipus . '' while seferis has sometimes been considered a nationalist poet , his 'hellenism ' had more to do with his identifying a unifying strand of humanism in the continuity of greek culture and literature . the other five finalists for the prize that year were w . h . auden , pablo neruda ( 1971 winner ) , samuel beckett ( 1969 winner ) , yukio mishima and aksel sandemose . . later life . in 1967 the repressive nationalist , right-wing regime of the colonels took power in greece after a coup d'état . after two years marked by widespread censorship , political detentions and torture , seferis took a stand against the regime . on march 28 , 1969 , he made a statement on the bbc world service , with copies simultaneously distributed to every newspaper in athens . in authoritative and absolute terms , he stated '' this anomaly must end '' . seferis did not live to see the end of the junta in 1974 as a direct result of turkey ’ s invasion of cyprus , which had itself been prompted by the junta ’ s attempt to overthrow cyprus 's president , archbishop makarios . he died in athens , on september 20 , 1971 . the cause of death was reported to be pneumonia , aggravated by a stroke he had suffered after undergoing surgery for a bleeding ulcer about two months earlier . at his funeral , huge crowds followed his coffin through the streets of athens , singing mikis theodorakis ’ setting of seferis 's poem 'denial ' ( then banned ) ; he had become a popular hero for his resistance to the regime . he is buried at first cemetery of athens . legacy . image : blue plaque george seferis , sloane avenue.jpg right thumb blue plaque at 7 sloane avenue , london his house at pangrati district of central athens , just next to the panathinaiko stadium of athens , still stands today at agras street . there are commemorative blue plaques on two of his london homes – 51 upper brook street , and at 7 sloane avenue . in 1999 , there was a dispute over the naming of a street in i̇zmir yorgos seferis sokagi due to continuing ill-feeling over the greco-turkish war in the early 1920s . in 2004 , the band sigmatropic released '' 16 haiku & other stories , '' an album dedicated to and lyrically derived from seferis 's work . vocalists included recording artists laetitia sadier , alejandro escovedo , cat power , and robert wyatt . seferis 's famous stanza from mythistorema was featured in the opening ceremony of the 2004 athens olympic games : i woke with this marble head in my hands ; it exhausts my elbows and i do n't know where to put it down . it was falling into the dream as i was coming out of the dream . so our life became one and it will be very difficult for it to separate again . stephen king quotes several of seferis 's poems in epigraphs to his 1975 novel salem 's lot . works . poetry . strofi στροφή ( strophe , 1931 ) sterna στέρνα ( the cistern , 1932 ) mythistorima μυθιστόρημα ( mythical narrative , 1935 ) tetradio gymnasmaton τετράδιο γυμνασμάτων ( book of exercises , 1940 ) imerologio katastromatos i ημερολόγιο καταστρώματος ι ( ship 's log book i , 1940 ) imerologio katastromatos ii ημερολόγιο καταστρώματος ιι ( log book ii , 1944 ) kichli κίχλη ( the thrush , 1947 ) imerologio katastromatos iii ημερολόγιο καταστρώματος ιιι ( log book iii , 1955 ) tria kryfa poiimata τρία κρυφά ποιήματα ( three secret poems , 1966 ) tetradio gymnasmaton ii τετράδιο γυμνασμάτων ii ( book of exercises ιι , 1976 ) . prose . dokimes ( essays ) 3 vols .
