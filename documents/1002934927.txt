Alfred de Vigny

biography . vigny was born in loches ( a town to which he never returned ) into an aristocratic family . his father was a 60-year-old veteran of the seven years ' war who died before vigny 's 20th birthday ; his mother , 20 years younger , was a strong-willed woman who was inspired by rousseau and took personal responsibility for vigny 's early education . his maternal grandfather , the marquis de baraudin , had served as commodore in the royal navy . vigny grew up in paris , and took preparatory studies for the école polytechnique at the lycée bonaparte , obtaining a good knowledge of french history and the bible before developing an '' inordinate love for the glory of bearing arms '' . as was the case for every noble family , the french revolution diminished the family 's circumstances considerably . after napoléon 's defeat at waterloo , a bourbon , louis xviii , the brother of louis xvi , was restored to power , and in 1814 vigny enrolled in one of the privileged aristocratic companies of the maison du roi ( king 's guard ) as a second lieutenant . image : kinson ( attribuea ) alfreddevigny.jpg thumb left 190px portrait of vigny , attributed to françois kinson . though he was promoted to first lieutenant in 1822 and to captain the following year , the military profession in time of peace bored him . after taking several leaves of absence he abandoned military life in 1827 , having already published his first poem le bal in 1820 and an ambitious narrative poem éloa in 1824 on the popular romantic theme of the redemption of satan . prolonging successive leaves from the army , he settled in paris with his young english bride lydia bunbury , whom he married in pau in 1825 . he collected his recent works in january 1826 in poèmes antiques et modernes . three months later he published the first important historical novel in french , cinq-mars , based on the life of louis xiii 's favorite henri coiffier de ruzé , marquis of cinq-mars , who conspired against the cardinal de richelieu . with the success of these two volumes , vigny seemed to be the rising star of the romantic movement , though one of vigny 's best friends , victor hugo , soon usurped that role . vigny wrote of hugo : '' the victor i loved is no more . now he likes to make saucy remarks and is turning into a liberal , which does not suit him . '' unlike hugo and alphonse de lamartine , who moved gradually to the center and then to the left during the 1830s , vigny remained pliantly centrist in his politics : he accepted the july monarchy , at first welcomed and then rejected the second french republic , and then supported napoleon iii . vigny later denounced members of his inner circle whom he suspected of republican sympathies to the imperial police . poliakov , léon ( 2003 ) . the history of anti-semitism : from voltaire to wagner . university of pennsylvania press , p . 364 . the visit of an english theater troupe to paris in 1827 revived french interest in shakespeare . vigny worked with emile deschamps on a translation of romeo and juliet . in 1831 he presented his first original play , la maréchale d'ancre , a historical drama recounting the events leading up to the reign of king louis xiii . attending the theater , he met the great actress marie dorval , and became her jealous lover until 1838 . price , blanche a .

( vigny 's wife had become a near invalid and never learned to speak french fluently ; they had no children , and vigny was also disappointed when his father-in-law 's remarriage deprived the couple of an anticipated inheritance . ) in 1835 vigny produced a drama titled chatterton , based on the life of thomas chatterton , with marie dorval starring as kitty bell . chatterton is considered to be one of the best of the french romantic dramas and is still performed regularly . the story of chatterton had inspired one of the three episodes of vigny 's philosophical novel stello ( 1832 ) , in which he examined the relationship of poetry to society and concluded that the poet , doomed to be regarded with suspicion in every social order , must remain somewhat aloof and apart from the social order . servitude et grandeur militaires ( 1835 ) was a similar tripartite meditation on the condition of the soldier . image : alfred de vigny , dessin de mérimée.jpg thumb left 190px sketch of alfred de vigny , by prosper mérimée . although vigny gained success as a writer , his personal life was not happy . his marriage was a disappointment ; his relationship with marie dorval was plagued by jealousy ; and his literary talent was eclipsed by the achievements of others . he grew embittered . after the death of his mother in 1838 he inherited the property of maine-giraud , near angoulême , where it was said that he had withdrawn to his 'ivory tower ' ( an expression sainte-beuve coined with reference to vigny ) . bartlett , john ( 1968 ) . familiar quotations . boston : little , brown and company , p . 615 . there vigny wrote some of his most famous poems , including la mort du loup and la maison du berger . proust regarded la maison du berger as the greatest french poem of the 19th century . in 1845 , after several unsuccessful attempts to be elected , vigny became a member of the académie française . in later years , vigny ceased to publish . he continued to write , however , and his journal is considered by modern scholars to be a great work in its own right , though it awaits a definitive scholarly edition . bird , c . wesley ( 1934 ) .

( 'when we see what we were on earth and what we leave behind/only silence is great ; everything else is weakness .
