'' the controversy over the remark calmed down when the expression was clarified to the media by danish linguists as having no racial connotations and simply meaning '' brat '' in danish . controversy arose in early 2004 , when journeyman heavyweight thomas williams stated that he had been bribed to throw his fight against nielsen in march , 2000 . along with promoter robert mitchell , williams was indicted by the united states district court for the district of nevada for match fixing in order to promote the career of richie melito , and it was during the fbi 's investigation of that case that williams admitted to intentionally losing to nielsen . the fix was arranged by promoter robert mittleman , a frequent associate of nielsen 's promoter mogens palle , who later confessed that he had been paid 1,000 , while williams had received '' up to 40,000 '' from palle in order to lose the fight . williams , mitchell and mittleman were all found guilty of sports bribery by the court in november and december , 2004 . the nielsen vs . williams fight was the 57th of nielsen 's career . nielsen and mogens palle denied any knowledge of the match fixing , and were not charged of any wrongdoing by american or danish authorities . professional boxing record . { class '' wikitable '' style '' text-align : center ;
