'' at age thirteen , ellison refused to have a bar mitzvah celebration . symonds and ellison , pp . 19–20 . ellison says that his fondness for israel is not connected to religious sentiments , but rather due to the innovative spirit of israelis in the technology sector . ellison attended south shore high school in chicago and later was admitted to university of illinois at urbana–champaign and was enrolled as a premed student . at illinois , he was named science student of the year but later withdrew without taking final exams after his sophomore year , because his adoptive mother had just died . after spending the summer of 1966 in california , he then attended the university of chicago for one term , studying physics and mathematics . he did not take any exams and at chicago he first encountered computer design . in 1966 , aged 22 , he moved to berkeley , california . early career and oracle . while working at ampex in the early 1970s , he became influenced by edgar f . codd 's research on relational database design , which led in 1977 to the formation of what became oracle . oracle became a successful database vendor to mid- and low-range systems , later competing with sybase ( created 1984 ) and microsoft sql server ( a port of sybase created in 1989 ) which led to ellison being listed by forbes as one of the richest people in the world . 1977–1994 . during the 1970s , after a brief stint at amdahl corporation , ellison began working for ampex corporation . his projects included a database for the cia , which he named '' oracle '' . ellison was inspired by a paper written by edgar f . codd on relational database systems called '' a relational model of data for large shared data banks '' . in 1977 , he founded software development laboratories ( sdl ) with two partners and an investment of 2,000 ; 1,200 of the money was his . in 1979 , the company renamed itself relational software inc . , and in 1983 , officially became oracle systems corporation after its flagship product , the oracle database . ellison had heard about the ibm system r database , also based on codd 's theories , and wanted oracle to achieve compatibility with it , but ibm made this impossible by refusing to share system r 's code . the initial release of oracle in 1979 was called oracle 2 ; there was no oracle 1 . in 1990 , oracle laid off 10 % of its workforce ( about 400 people ) because it was losing money . this crisis , which almost resulted in the company 's bankruptcy , came about because of oracle 's '' up-front '' marketing strategy , in which sales people urged potential customers to buy the largest possible amount of software all at once . the sales people then booked the value of future license sales in the current quarter , thereby increasing their bonuses . this became a problem when the future sales subsequently failed to materialize . oracle eventually had to restate its earnings twice , and had to settle class-action lawsuits arising from its having overstated its earnings . ellison would later say that oracle had made '' an incredible business mistake '' . although ibm dominated the mainframe relational database market with its db2 and sql/ds database products , it delayed entering the market for a relational database on unix and windows operating systems . this left the door open for sybase , oracle , informix , and eventually microsoft to dominate mid-range systems and microcomputers . around this time , oracle fell behind sybase . from 1990 to 1993 , sybase was the fastest-growing database company and the database industry 's darling vendor , but soon it fell victim to merger mania . sybase 's 1996 merger with powersoft resulted in a loss of focus on its core database technology . in 1993 , sybase sold the rights to its database software running under the windows operating system to microsoft corporation , which now markets it under the name '' sql server '' . in his early years at oracle , larry ellison was named an award recipient in the high technology category for the ey entrepreneur of the year program . . 1994–2010 . in 1994 , informix overtook sybase and became oracle 's most important rival . the intense war between informix ceo phil white and ellison was front-page silicon valley news for three years . in april 1997 , informix announced a major revenue shortfall and earnings restatements . phil white eventually landed in jail , and ibm absorbed informix in 2001 . also in 1997 , ellison was made a director of apple computer after steve jobs returned to the company . ellison resigned in 2002 . with the defeat of informix and of sybase , oracle enjoyed years of industry dominance until the rise of microsoft sql server in the late 1990s and ibm 's acquisition of informix software in 2001 to complement their db2 database . oracle 's main competition for new database licenses on unix , linux , and windows operating systems comes from ibm 's db2 and from microsoft sql server . ibm 's db2 still dominates the mainframe database market . in 2005 , oracle corporation paid ellison a 975,000 salary , a 6,500,000 bonus , and other compensation of 955,100 . in 2007 , ellison earned a total compensation of 61,180,524 , which included a base salary of 1,000,000 , a cash bonus of 8,369,000 , and options granted of 50,087,100 . in 2008 , he earned a total compensation of 84,598,700 , which included a base salary of 1,000,000 , a cash bonus of 10,779,000 , no stock grants , and options granted of 71,372,700 . in the year ending may 31 , 2009 , he made 56.8 & nbsp ;
