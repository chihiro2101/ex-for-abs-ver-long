Blaise Cendrars

early years and education . he was born in la chaux-de-fonds , neuchâtel , switzerland , rue de la paix 27 , into a bourgeois francophone family , to a swiss father and a scottish mother . richard kostelanetz , a dictionary of the avant-gardes , routledge ( 2013 ) , p . 113 they sent young frédéric to a german boarding school , but he ran away . at the realschule in basel in 1902 he met his lifelong friend the sculptor august suter . next they enrolled him in a school in neuchâtel , but he had little enthusiasm for his studies . finally , in 1904 , he left school due to poor performance and began an apprenticeship with a swiss watchmaker in russia . while living in st . petersburg , he began to write , thanks to the encouragement of r.r . , a librarian at the national library of russia . there he wrote the poem , '' the legend of novgorode '' , which r.r . translated into russian . supposedly fourteen copies were made , but cendrars claimed to have no copies of it , and none could be located during his lifetime . in 1995 , the bulgarian poet kiril kadiiski claimed to have found one of the russian translations in sofia , but the authenticity of the document remains contested on the grounds of factual , typographic , orthographic , and stylistic analysis . dany savelli , « examen du paratexte de la légende de novgorode découverte à sofia et attribuée à blaise cendrars » , in revue de littérature comparée n°313 , 2005/1 , pp.21-33 . in 1907 , sauser returned to switzerland , where he studied medicine at the university of berne . during this period , he wrote his first verified poems , séquences , influenced by remy de gourmont 's le latin mystique . literary career . cendrars was the first exponent of modernism in european poetry with his works : the legend of novgorode ( 1907 ) , les pâques à new york ( 1912 ) , la prose du transsibérien et la petite jehanne de france ( 1913 ) , séquences ( 1913 ) , la guerre au luxembourg ( 1916 ) , le panama ou les aventures de mes sept oncles ( 1918 ) , j'ai tué ( 1918 ) , and dix-neuf poèmes élastiques ( 1919 ) . he was the first modernist poet , not only in terms of expressing the fundamental values of modernism but also in terms of creating its first solid poetical synthesis , although this achievement did not grow out of a literary project or any theoretical considerations but from cendrars ' instinctive attraction to all that was new in the age and equally alive for him in literature of the past . in many ways , he was a direct heir of rimbaud , a visionary rather than what the french call un homme de lettres ( '' a man of letters '' ) , a term that for him was predicated on a separation of intellect and life . like rimbaud , who writes in '' the alchemy of the word '' in a season in hell , '' i liked absurd paintings over door panels , stage sets , backdrops for acrobats , signs , popular engravings , old-fashioned literature , church latin , erotic books full of misspellings , '' cendrars similarly says of himself in der sturm ( 1913 ) , '' i like legends , dialects , mistakes of language , detective novels , the flesh of girls , the sun , the eiffel tower . '' in aujourd'hui 1917-1929 , ed . miriam cendrars ( paris , 1987 , p . 13 spontaneity , boundless curiosity , a craving for travel , and immersion in actualities were his hallmarks both in life and art . he was drawn to this same immersion in balzac 's flood of novels on 19th-century french society and in casanova 's travels and adventures through 18th-century europe , which he set down in dozens of volumes of memoirs that cendrars considered '' the true encyclopedia of the eighteenth century , filled with life as they are , unlike diderot 's , and the work of a single man , who was neither an ideologue nor a theoretician '' . cendrars , '' pro domo , '' the end of the world filmed by the angel of notre dame , in cendrars , modernities and other writings , ed . monique chefdor and trans . by esther allen in collaboration with chefdor ( university of nebraska press , 1992 ) , p . 34 cendrars regarded the early modernist movement from roughly 1910 to the mid-1920s as a period of genuine discovery in the arts and in 1919 contrasted '' theoretical cubism '' with '' the group 's three antitheoreticians , '' picasso , braque , and léger , whom he described as '' three strongly personal painters who represent the three successive phases of cubism . '' cendrars , '' modernities 3 , in chefdor , p . 96 after a short stay in paris , he traveled to new york , arriving on 11 december 1911 . between 6–8 april 1912 , he wrote his long poem , les pâques à new york ( easter in new york ) , his first important contribution to modern literature . he signed it for the first time with the name blaise cendrars . the name '' blaise '' is an exact echo of the english '' blaze , '' and '' cendrars '' is a compound of the french word for cinders and the latin '' ars '' for art . his full name is thus the metaphorical equivalent of the mythical phoenix , or firebird , with its power to rise from its own ashes . it is cendrars ' emblem of the act of creation in writing : car écrire c'est brûler vif , mais c'est aussi renaître de ses cendres ( '' to write is to be burned alive , but it is also to be reborn from one 's ashes '' ) . cendrars , l'homme foudroyé ( paris : denoël ) , p . 13 in the summer of 1912 , cendrars returned to paris , convinced that poetry was his vocation . with emil szittya , an anarchist writer , he started the journal les hommes nouveaux , also the name of the press where he published les pâques à new york and séquences . he became acquainted with the international array of artists and writers in paris , such as chagall , léger , survage , suter , modigliani , csaky , archipenko , jean hugo and robert delaunay . most notably , he encountered guillaume apollinaire . the two poets influenced each other 's work . cendrars ' poem les pâques à new york influenced apollinaire 's poem zone . cendrars ' style was based on photographic impressions , cinematic effects of montage and rapid changes of imagery , and scenes of great emotional force , often with the power of a hallucination . these qualities , which also inform his prose , are already evident in easter in new york and in his best known and even longer poem the transsiberian , with its scenes of revolution and the far east in flames in the russo-japanese war ( '' the earth stretches elongated and snaps back like an accordion / tortured by a sadic hand / in the rips in the sky insane locomotives / take flight / in the gaps / whirling wheels mouths voices / and the dogs of disaster howling at our heels '' ) . trans . john dos passos , in his celebratory essay on cendrars , '' homer of the trans-siberian , orient express ( new york , harper & brothers , 1927 ) , p . 160 the published work was printed within washes of color by the painter sonia delaunay as a fold-out two meters in length , together with her design of brilliant colors down the left-hand side , a small map of the transsiberian railway in the upper right corner , and a painted silhouette in orange of the eiffel tower in the lower left . cendrars called the work the first '' simultaneous poem '' . soon after , it was exhibited as a work of art in its own right and continues to be shown at exhibitions to this day . see '' 'french book art ' at the public library , '' roberta smith , new york times , may 19 , 2006 , and the museum of modern art 's official exhibition card of 2013 for '' inventing abstraction : 1910-1925 , online at inventingabstraction.tumblr.com , where a vertical section of the work is displayed this intertwining of poetry and painting was related to robert delaunay 's and other artists ' experiments in proto-expressionism . at the same time gertrude stein was beginning to write prose in the manner of pablo picasso 's paintings . cendrars liked to claim that his poem 's first printing of one hundred fifty copies would , when unfolded , reach the height of the eiffel tower . marjorie perloff , the futurist moment , p3 cendrars ' relationship with painters such as chagall and léger led him to write a series of revolutionary abstract short poems , published in a collection in 1919 under the title dix-neuf poèmes élastiques ( nineteen elastic poems ) . some were tributes to his fellow artists . in 1954 , a collaboration between cendrars and léger resulted in paris , ma ville ( paris , my city ) , in which the poet and illustrator together expressed their love of the french capital . as léger died in 1955 , the book was not published until 1987 . the left-handed poet . his writing career was interrupted by world war i . when it began , he and the italian writer ricciotto canudo appealed to other foreign artists to join the french army . he joined the french foreign legion . he was sent to the front line in the somme where from mid-december 1914 until february 1915 , he was in the line at frise ( la grenouillère and bois de la vache ) . he described this war experience in the books la main coupée ( the severed hand ) and j'ai tué ( i have killed ) , and it is the subject of his poem '' orion '' in travel notes : '' it is my star / it is in the shape of a hand / it is my hand gone up to the sky . '' it was during the attacks in champagne in september 1915 that cendrars lost his right arm and was discharged from the army . jean cocteau introduced him to eugenia errázuriz , who proved a supportive , if at times possessive , patron . around 1918 he visited her house and was so taken with the simplicity of the décor that he was inspired to write the poems published as de outremer à indigo ( from ultramarine to indigo ) . he stayed with eugenia in her house in biarritz , in a room decorated with murals by picasso . at this time , he drove an old alfa romeo which had been colour-coordinated by georges braque . richardandson , op . cit . pages 9 and 14 . cendrars became an important part of the artistic community in montparnasse ; his writings were considered a literary epic of the modern adventurer . he was a friend of the american writer henry miller , see miller 's essay '' blaise cendrars '' in the books in my life ( 1969 ) who called him his '' great idol '' , a man he '' really venerated as a writer '' . miller , speaking in henry miller awake and asleep , 1975 documentary film he knew many of the writers , painters , and sculptors living in paris . in 1918 , his friend amedeo modigliani painted his portrait . he was acquainted with ernest hemingway , who mentions having seen him '' with his broken boxer 's nose and his pinned-up empty sleeve , rolling a cigarette with his one good hand '' , at the closerie des lilas in paris . ernest hemingway , a movable feast , the restored edition , scribner , 2009 . he was also befriended by john dos passos , who was his closest american counterpart both as a world traveler ( even more than hemingway ) and in his adaptation of cendrars ' cinematic uses of montage in writing , most notably in his great trilogy of the 1930s , u.s.a . one of the most gifted observers of the times , dos passos brought cendrars to american readers in the 1920s and 30s by translating cendrars ' major long poems the transsiberian and panama and in his 1926 prose-poetic essay '' homer of the transsiberian , '' which was reprinted from the saturday review one year later in orient express . steve kogan , '' the pilgrimage of blaise cendrars '' , literary imagination , january , 2001 after the war , cendrars became involved in the movie industry in italy , france , and the united states . on cendrars ' immersion in the film world , see garrett white 's introduction to his translation of cendrars ' reports on hollywood for paris-soir in hollywood : mecca of the movies cendrars ' departure from poetry in the 1920s roughly coincided with his break from the world of the french intellectuals , summed up in his farewell to painters ( 1926 ) and the last section of l'homme foudroyé ( 1944 ) , after which he began to make numerous trips to south america ( '' while others were going to moscow '' , as he writes in that chapter ) . it was during this second half of his career that he began to concentrate on novels , short stories , and , near the end and just after world war ii , on his magnificent poetic-autobiographical tetralogy , beginning with l'homme foudroyé . later years . cendrars continued to be active in the paris artistic community , encouraging younger artists and writing about them . for instance , he described the hungarian photographer ervin marton as an '' ace of white and black photography '' in a preface to his exhibition catalogue . marton ervin emlékkiállítása , budapest : hungarian national gallery ( magyar nemzeti galéria ) , 1971 ; open library , accessed 1 sep 2010 he was with the british expeditionary force in northern france at the beginning of the german invasion in 1940 , and his book that immediately followed , chez l'armée anglaise ( with the english army ) , was seized before publication by the gestapo , which sought him out and sacked his library in his country home , while he fled into hiding in aix-en-provence . he comments on the trampling of his library and temporary '' extinction of my personality '' at the beginning of l'homme foudroyé ( in the double sense of '' the man who was blown away '' ) . in occupied france , the gestapo listed cendrars as a jewish writer of '' french expression '' , but he managed to survive . his youngest son was killed in an accident while escorting american planes in morocco . details of his time with the bef and last meeting with his son appear in his work of 1949 le lotissement du ciel ( translated simply as sky ) . in 1950 , cendrars settled down in the rue jean-dolent in paris , across from the la santé prison . there he collaborated frequently with radiodiffusion française . he finally published again in 1956 . the novel , emmène-moi au bout du monde ! … , was his last work before he suffered a stroke in 1957 . he died in 1961 . his ashes are held at le tremblay-sur-mauldre . legacy and honors . in 1960 , andré malraux , the minister of culture , awarded him the title of commander of the légion d'honneur for his wartime service . 1961 , cendrars was awarded the paris grand prix for literature . his literary estate is archived in the swiss literary archives in bern . the centre d'études blaise cendrars ( cebc ) has been established at the university of berne in his honor and for the study of his work . the french-language association internationale blaise cendrars was established to study and preserve his works . the lycée blaise-cendrars in la chaux-de-fonds was named in his honor . works . name of the work , year of first edition , publisher ( in paris if not otherwise noted ) / kind of work / known translations ( year of first edition in that language ) les pâques à new york ( 1912 , éditions des hommes nouveaux ) / poem / spanish ( 1975 ) la prose du transsibérien et la petite jehanne de france ( 1913 , éditions des hommes nouveaux ) / poem / spanish ( 1975 ) ; bengali ( 1981 , bish sataker pharasi kabita , aliance française de calcutta ; 1997 ) selected poems blaise cendrars ( 1979 , penguin modern european poets , /english tr . pete hoida ) séquences ( 1913 , editions des hommes nouveaux ) rimsky-korsakov et la nouvelle musique russe ( 1913 ) la guerre au luxembourg ( 1916 , d . niestlé , editor ) / poem / spanish ( 1975 ) profond aujourd'hui ( 1917 , a la belle édition ) le panama ou les aventures de mes sept oncles ( 1918 , éditions de la sirène ) / poem / english ( 1931 ) ; spanish ( 1975 ) ; bengali ( 2009 ) j'ai tué ( 1918 , la belle édition ) / poetic essay / english ( 1992 ) dix-neuf poèmes élastiques - ( 1919 , au sans pareil ) / poems / spanish ( 1975 ) la fin du monde filmée par l'ange notre-dame - ( 1919 , éditions de la sirène ) / english ( 1992 ) anthologie nègre - ( 1921 , éditions de la sirène ) / african folk tales / spanish ( 1930 ) ; english ( 1972 ) documentaires - ( 1924 , with the title '' kodak '' , librairie stock ) / poems / spanish ( 1975 ) feuilles de route - ( 1924 , au sans pareil ) / spanish ( 1975 ) l'or ( 1925 , grasset ) / novel / english ( sutter 's gold , 1926 , harper & bros . ) / spanish ( 1931 ) moravagine ( 1926 , grasset ) / novel / spanish ( 1935 ) ; english ( 1968 ) ; danish ( 2016 , basilisk ) l'abc du cinéma ( 1926 , les écrivains réunis ) / english ( 1992 ) l'eubage ( 1926 , au sans pareil ) / english ( 1992 ) éloge de la vie dangereuse ( 1926 , les écrivains réunis ) / poetic essay / english ( 1992 ) ; spanish ( 1994 ) le plan de l'aiguille ( 1927 , au sans pareil ) / novel / spanish ( 1931 ) ; english ( 1987 ) petits contes nègres pour les enfants des blancs ( 1928 , éditions de portiques ) / portuguese ( 1989 ) les confessions de dan yack ( 1929 , au sans pareil ) / novel / spanish ( 1930 ) ; english ( 1990 ) une nuit dans la forêt ( 1929 , lausanne , éditions du verseau ) / autobiographical essay comment les blancs sont d'anciens noirs - ( 1929 , au sans pareil ) rhum—l'aventure de jean galmot ( 1930 , grasset ) / novel / spanish ( 1937 ) aujourd'hui ( 1931 , grasset ) vol à voile ( 1932 , lausanne , librairie payot ) panorama de la pègre ( 1935 , grenoble , arthaud ) / journalism hollywood , la mecque du cinéma ( 1936 , grasset ) / journalism histoires vraies ( 1937 , grasset ) / stories / spanish ( 1938 ) la vie dangereuse ( 1938 , grasset ) / stories d'oultremer à indigo ( 1940 , grasset ) chez l'armée anglaise ( 1940 , corrêa ) / journalism poésie complète ( 1944 , denoël ) , complete poetic works / english ( complete poems , tr . by ron padgett , univ . of california press , 1992 ) l'homme foudroyé ( 1945 , denoël ) / novel / english ( 1970 ) ; spanish ( 1983 ) la main coupée ( 1946 , denoël ) / novel / ( in french ) / english ( lice , 1973 / the bloody hand , 2014 ) , spanish ( 1980 ) bourlinguer ( 1948 , denoël ) / novel / english ( 1972 ) ; spanish ( 2004 ) le lotissement du ciel ( 1949 , denoël ) / novel / english ( 1992 ) la banlieue de paris ( 1949 , lausanne , la guilde du livre ) / essay with photos by robert doisneau blaise cendrars , vous parle .
