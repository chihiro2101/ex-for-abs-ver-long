from the house of asseburg , the descendants of widekind . the castle was rebuilt by the welf duke henry i of brunswick from 1283 onwards . by 1432 , the town had become the permanent residence of the brunswick princes of wolfenbüttel . devastated in the 1542 schmalkaldic war , it was largely rebuilt in a renaissance style under duke julius of brunswick-lüneburg , including several gracht waterways laid out by hans vredeman de vries . the duke vested the citizens with market town in 1570 and founded the ducal library ( herzogliche bibliothek , the later bibliotheca augusta ) two years later . during the thirty years ' war , danish troops under king christian iv occupied the fortified town in 1626 . upon the nearby battle of lutter , they were besieged by the imperial forces of general

1571–1621 ) served as kapellmeister of the brunswick dukes . from 1682 , the composer johann rosenmüller ( 1619–1684 ) , who had to flee germany due to allegations of homosexuality , spent his last
