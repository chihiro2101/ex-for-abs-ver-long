'' guadalupe day '' is regarded by many mexicans as the most important religious holiday of their country . it honors the virgin of guadalupe , the patron saint of mexico , and it is celebrated on december 12 . in the last decade , all the celebrations happening from mid-december to the beginning of january have been linked together in what has been called the guadalupe-reyes marathon . epiphany on the evening of january 5 marks the twelfth night of christmas and is when the figurines of the three wise men are added to the nativity scene . traditionally in mexico , as with many other latin american countries , santa claus does not hold the significance that he does in the united states . rather , it is the three wise men who are the bearers of gifts , who leave presents in or near the shoes of small children . mexican families also commemorate the date by eating rosca de reyes . the day of the dead incorporates pre-columbian beliefs with christian elements . the holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died . an idea behind this day suggests the living must attend to the dead so that the dead will

north , local traditions are now being observed and intertwined with the greater north american santa claus tradition , as well as with other holidays such as halloween , due to americanization via film and television , creating an economy of gifting tradition that spans from christmas day until january 6 . a piñata is made from papier-mache . it is created to look like popular people , animals

staple foods . next to corn , rice is the most common grain in mexican cuisine . according to food writer karen hursh graber , the initial introduction of rice to spain from north africa in the 14th century led to the spanish introduction of rice to mexico at the port of veracruz in the 1520s . this , graber says , created one of the earliest instances of the world 's greatest fusion cuisines . in southeastern mexico , especially in the yucatán peninsula , spicy vegetable and meat dishes are common . the cuisine of southeastern mexico has quite a bit of caribbean influence , given its geographical location . seafood is commonly prepared in the states that border the pacific ocean or the gulf of mexico , the latter having a famous reputation for its fish dishes , à la veracruzana . in contemporary times , various world cuisines have become popular in mexico , thus adopting a mexican fusion . for example , sushi in mexico is often made by using a variety of sauces based on mango and tamarind , and very often served with serrano-chili blended soy sauce , or complemented with vinegar , habanero peppers , and chipotle peppers . chocolate originated in mexico and was prized by the aztecs . it remains an important ingredient in mexican cookery . music and dance . the foundation of mexican music comes from its indigenous sounds and heritage . the original inhabitants of the land used drums ( such as the teponaztli ) , flutes , rattles , conches as trumpets and their voices to make music and dances . this ancient music is still played in some parts of mexico . however , much of the traditional contemporary music of mexico was written during and after the spanish colonial period , using many old world influenced instruments . many traditional instruments , such as the
