25 july 1814 and was appointed a order of the bath on 2 january 1815 . somerset also saw action during the hundred days : he served on wellington 's staff at the battle of quatre bras on 16 june 1815

sent to the crimea with the temporary rank of full general on 21 february 1854 and was promoted to the substantive rank of full general on 20 june 1854 . while raglan 's primary objective was to defend istanbul he was ordered by the duke of newcastle , who was at the time secretary of state for war , to besiege the russian port of sevastopol '' unless it could not be undertaken with a reasonable prospect of success '' . hibbert , p . 56 an anglo-french force under the joint command of somerset and general jacques st . arnaud defeated general alexander menshikov 's russian army at the battle of alma in september 1854 . during the campaign raglan had the abstracted habit of referring to the russian enemies as '' the french '' . while this eccentricity is often cited as evidence of his unsuitability for high command , he did in fact speak fluent french and relations between the two allies in the field were good . at the battle of balaclava in october 1854 , raglan issued an order to the earl of lucan , his cavalry commander , who in turn ordered the earl of cardigan , a subordinate commander who happened to be lucan 's brother-in-law and who detested him , to lead the fateful charge of the light brigade leading to some 278 british casualties . calthorpe , p . 132 despite an indecisive result at balaclava the british and french allied army gained a victory at the

raglan was blamed by the press and the government for the sufferings of the british soldiers in the terrible crimean winter during the siege of sevastopol owing to shortages of food and clothing martin , p . 181 although this , in part , was the fault of the home authorities who failed to provide adequate logistical support . a piecemeal allied assault on sevastopol on 18 june 1855 was a complete failure . the anxieties of the siege began to seriously undermine raglan 's health and he died unexpectedly on 28 june 1855 , while suffering with dysentery and depression . his body was brought home and interred at st michael and all angels church , badminton . raglan had also served as honorary colonel of the 53rd regiment of foot and then as honorary colonel of the royal horse
