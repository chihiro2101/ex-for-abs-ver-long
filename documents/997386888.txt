Terence Rattigan

early life . terence rattigan was born in 1911 in south kensington , wansell , p . 13 . london , of irish protestant extraction . sir terence rattigan profile pollard , wendy . the literary encyclopedia . 24 may 2005 . retrieved 11 march 2009 . he had an elder brother , brian . they were the grandsons of sir william henry rattigan , an india-based jurist , and later a liberal unionist member of parliament for north-east lanarkshire . his father was frank rattigan cmg , a diplomat whose exploits included an affair with princess elisabeth of romania ( future consort of king george ii of greece ) which resulted in her having an abortion . the royal house of romania is considered to be the inspiration of rattigan 's play the sleeping prince . rattigan 's birth certificate and his birth announcement in the times indicate he was born on 9 june 1911 . however , most reference books state that he was born the following day ; rattigan himself never publicly disputed this date . there is evidence suggesting that the date on the birth certificate is incorrect . he was given no middle name , but he adopted the middle name '' mervyn '' in early adulthood . education . rattigan was educated at sandroyd school from 1920 to 1925 , at the time based in cobham , surrey ( and now the home of reed 's school ) , and harrow school . rattigan played cricket for the harrow first xi and scored 29 in the eton v harrow in 1929 . he was a member of the harrow school officer training corps and organised a mutiny , informing the daily express . even more annoying to his headmaster , cyril norwood , was the telegram from the eton otc , '' offering to march to his assistance '' . john colville , footprints in time , 1976 . chapter 8 , two faces . he then went to trinity college , oxford . life and career . success as a playwright came early , with the comedy french without tears in 1936 , set in a crammer . this was inspired by a 1933 visit to a village called marxzell in the black forest , where young english gentlemen went to learn german ; his time briefly overlapped with his harrow classmate jock colville . rattigan 's determination to write a more serious play produced after the dance ( 1939 ) , a satirical social drama about the '' bright young things '' and their failure to politically engage . the outbreak of the second world war scuppered any chances of a long run . shortly before the war , rattigan had written ( together with anthony goldsmith ) a satire about nazi germany , follow my leader ; the lord chamberlain refused to license it on grounds of offence to a foreign country , but it was performed from january 1940 . '' a topical comedy '' , the times , 15 january 1940 , p . 4 . during the war , rattigan served in the royal air force as a tail gunner ; his experiences helped inspire flare path and he was released from the service to help rewrite it as a film screenplay ( which eventually appeared as the way to the stars in 1945 ) . after the war , rattigan alternated between comedies and dramas , establishing himself as a major playwright : the most successful of which were the winslow boy ( 1946 ) , the browning version ( 1948 ) , the deep blue sea ( 1952 ) , and separate tables ( 1954 ) . rattigan 's belief in understated emotions and craftsmanship was deemed old fashioned after the overnight success in 1956 of john osborne 's look back in anger began the era of kitchen sink dramas by the writers known as the angry young men . rattigan responded to this critical disfavour with some bitterness . his plays ross , man and boy , in praise of love , and cause célèbre , however show no sign of any decline in his talent . rattigan explained that he wrote his plays to please a symbolic playgoer , '' aunt edna '' , someone from the well-off middle-class who had conventional tastes ; his critics frequently used this character as the basis for belittling him . '' sir terence rattigan '' , the times , 1 december 1977 , p . 16 . '' aunt edna '' inspired joe orton to create '' edna welthorpe '' , a mischievous alter ego stirring up controversy about his own plays . rattigan was gay , with numerous lovers but no long-term partners , a possible exception being his '' congenial companion . and occasional friend '' michael franklin . darlow , michael : terence rattigan—the man and his work , london : quartet books , 2010 , p . 440 . it has been claimed his work is essentially autobiographical , containing coded references to his sexuality , which he kept secret from all but his closest friends . there is some truth in this , but it risks being crudely reductive ; for example , the repeated claim that rattigan originally wrote the deep blue sea as a play about male lovers , turned at the last minute into a heterosexual play , is unfounded , b.a . young mentions a '' kenneth morgan version '' of the play that was supposedly shown to rattigan collaborator alvin rakoff in 1962 and that has since disappeared ( young , b.a . : the rattigan version , london : hamish hamilton , 1986 , p . 110 ) . darlow also speculates on the possible existence of such a draft ( darlow , michael : terence rattigan — the man and his work , london : quartet books , 2010 , p . 440 ) . though rattigan said otherwise . rattigan 's letter to john osborne , 1968 cited in john osborne looking back , london : faber , 1999 , p . 286 ( originally published in almost a gentleman , faber , 1991 ) . on the other hand , for the broadway staging of separate tables , he wrote an alternative version of the newspaper article in which major pollock 's indiscretions are revealed to his fellow hotel guests ; in this version , those whom the major approached for sex were men rather than young women . however , rattigan changed his mind about staging it , and the original version proceeded . rattigan was fascinated with the life and character of t . e . lawrence . in 1960 he wrote a play called ross , based on lawrence 's exploits . preparations were made to film it , and dirk bogarde accepted the role . however , it did not proceed because the rank organisation withdrew its support , not wishing to offend david lean and sam spiegel , who had started to film lawrence of arabia . bogarde called rank 's decision '' my bitterest disappointment '' . also in 1960 , a musical version of french without tears was staged as joie de vivre , with music by robert stolz of white horse inn fame . it starred donald sinden , lasted only four performances , and has never been revived . rattigan was diagnosed as having leukaemia in 1962 and recovered two years later , but fell ill again in 1968 . he disliked the so-called swinging london of the 1960s and moved abroad , living in bermuda , where he lived off the proceeds from lucrative screenplays including the v.i.p.s and the yellow rolls-royce . for a time he was the highest-paid screenwriter in the world . in 1964 , rattigan wrote to the playwright joe orton congratulating him on the outrageous comedy entertaining mr sloane , to which rattigan had escorted vivien leigh in its first week . he invested £3,000 in getting the play transferred to the west end . although an unlikely champion of the risqué orton , rattigan recognised the younger man 's talent and approved of what he considered a very well written piece of theatre . he also acknowledged in retrospect that , '' in a way , i was not orton 's best sponsor . i 'm a very unfashionable figure still , and i was then wildly unfashionable critically . my sponsorship rather put critics off , i think .
