'' laurence fishburne was offered the role of ike turner five times and turned it down each time . '' it was pretty one-sided , '' said fishburne , who turned down the project based on the script he first read . ike , fishburne added , was '' obviously the villain of the piece , but there was no explanation as to why he behaved the way he behaved - why she was with him for 16 to 20 years , what made her stay . '' the writers made some changes and though ike is still shown as a pretty despicable sort , the film offers at least some insight into him - most notably a scene in which ike recalls watching , at age 6 , his father 's death from wounds suffered in a fight over a woman . the changes helped persuade fishburne to do the role , but he says that bassett 's casting as tina '' was the deciding factor . '' fishburne did not have ike turner around as a role model as much as he would have liked . he met him once during production of the film . '' he was not particularly welcome on this project , '' fishburne says . the actor 's only meeting was a brief introduction when ike showed up at the turners ' former home in view park during a location shoot . ike signed some autographs and showed fishburne his walk . '' it was nice to meet him , '' says fishburne . '' regardless of his actions , he was so much a part of tina 's life . the movie is about him just as much as her . it 's unfortunate that he was n't welcomed , that both of them were n't around more . '' director brian gibson had no contact with ike . '' i never spoke to him , '' says gibson . '' i was not allowed to . disney felt that it would not be a good idea . '' screenwriter kate lanier omitted much of the brutality tina turner said she endured in her book . her character was also sanitized , most notably her relationship with saxophonist raymond hill and the birth of their son was excluded from the film . lanier admitted that tina turner was not happy with certain aspects of the film because some parts were fictionalized . tina turner tried to talk to the disney filmmakers about the script . in 1993 , she told vanity fair that they saw '' a deep need '' to make a film about '' a woman who was a victim to a con man . how weak ! how shallow ! how dare you think that was what i was ? i was in control every minute there . i was there because i wanted to be , because i had promised . '' she added , '' o.k . so if i was a victim , fine . maybe i was a victim for a short while . but give me credit for thinking the whole time i was there . see , i do have pride . '' . inaccuracies . though most of the scenes from the film were somehow depicted from tina turner 's autobiography i , tina , some other elements were '' fictionalized for dramatic purposes . '' ike did not sing or play guitar on the record '' rocket 88 '' as depicted in the film . ike wrote the song and played piano on the record . his saxophonist jackie brenston was the vocalist . the record was released under the alias jackie brenston and his delta cats who were actually ike 's band the kings of rhythm . the song anna mae first performs onstage with ike , '' you know i love you '' , was actually a slower b.b . king blues ballad where king is lamenting over a broken relationship . ike turner played piano on king 's original record . tina recorded a song with the title of king 's song with similar lyrics she composed with a blues rock composition . despite this , the record is still credited as written by king on the soundtrack . the first recording anna mae records , titled '' tina 's wish '' , in the soundtrack , was actually a 1973 track titled '' make me over '' recorded and co-written by tina on the album , nutbush city limits . her first recording is the 1958 song '' boxtop '' , a calypso-ish rock number featuring carlson oliver singing with her and ike who sings bass-baritone on the track . a theater marquee announces a 1960 show starring '' otis redding , martha and the vandellas , ike and tina turner . '' in reality , martha and the vandellas were known as the del-phis until 1961 . otis redding did n't become a solo act until 1962 . in the film , anna mae learns of her name change to tina turner after the song is played on a radio in the hospital where a groggy anna had given birth . in reality , however , tina said she saw a vinyl copy of the song that showcased the name '' ike & tina turner . '' in real life , ike did n't call her anna mae , he called her either ann or '' bo '' ( short for bullock ) . even after she received the stage name tina turner , family and friends still called her ann . the film insinuates that tina 's firstborn craig is ike 's biological child . in reality , craig turner ( 1958â€“2018 ) was tina 's son with ike 's saxophonist raymond hill . ike later adopted craig . tina gave birth to her son ronnie , fathered by ike in 1960 . the film depicts the couple getting married after ike and his entourage sneak tina out of the hospital . in reality , tina wrote in her book i , tina that ike was not present for the birth of their son . after tina checked herself out of the hospital , she discovered the woman ike hired to substitute as '' tina turner '' while she recuperated was a sex worker using her name to get clients . tina confronted the woman and they got into a fight . she fired her and then performed a show . ike wrote in his book takin ' back my name that he was unaware the woman was a prostitute . he was out of town to attend a court hearing in st . louis when tina gave birth in los angeles . they married in 1962 , two years after the birth of their son . lorraine taylor , the mother of ike 's sons ike jr and michael , did not drop them off at his home with tina as depicted in the film . in reality , ike went to st . louis and brought his sons to los angeles after lorraine informed him she was going to leave them there . tina also brought her son craig to live with them . a reenactment clip of an interview with ike & tina was featured in 1964 , rather than 1971 where the real-life turners were interviewed backstage at caesars palace in a similar posture : with tina talking throughout and ike keeping silent with his back to tina , smoking a cigarette . in a scene dated 1968 , ike and tina open for the rolling stones performing '' proud mary . '' in reality , ike and tina did n't perform '' proud mary '' until after it was released by creedence clearwater revival in 1969 . the rolling stones did n't have any concerts in 1968 ; ike and tina opened for them on their 1966 british tour and 1969 american tour . the characters jackie and frost did not exist in real life . jackie represents an amalgamation of ikettes and associates of tina . the infamous '' eat the cake anna mae '' scene was an exaggerated reenactment of a real-life incident that occurred during the early years of the revue where tina recalled a waitress giving her a pound cake while they were sitting in a car . though tina said she did n't order it , ike ordered her to eat all of it while he watched . the scene where ike rapes tina during the recording of '' nutbush city limits '' was exaggerated from what tina stated in her book . she claimed that sometimes after ike would hit her , he then would have sex with her . ike maintained that he never raped tina . also , '' nutbush city limits '' was recorded at the turners ' bolic sound recording studio , not at their home as depicted in the film . the film depicts tina 's suicide attempt in 1974 when it actually occurred six years prior in 1968 . ike did not tell tina '' if you do n't make it , i 'll kill you '' as depicted in the ambulance scene . tina said in her book that after her suicide attempt she joked with a friend that she was so afraid of ike , he probably threatened her which is why she survived . tina was unconscious so she did n't know what he actually said . ike said in his book that he scolded tina as his way of motivating her to fight for her life . during the time tina is planning her comeback in the early 1980s , a reenactment of an interview features tina rehearsing her song '' i might have been queen . '' the song would be recorded for her comeback album , private dancer . the incident in the ritz theatre where ike fails to scare tina with his pistol was fabricated . in her book , tina claimed that ike tried to send people to threaten to kill her and her associates after she left him . ike did not threaten tina in person with a gun as depicted . before performing '' what 's love got to do with it '' at the ritz in 1983 , the emcee announces that it was her '' first appearance , '' but she first performed there in 1981 . her 1983 performance there occurred before the recording of '' what 's love got to do with it '' and led to capitol records signing a contract with her . a title card at the end states that tina 's first solo album won four grammy awards , implying it was private dancer . in reality that album was turner 's fifth solo album . her first two solo albums ( tina turns the country on ! and acid queen ) were released while she was still with ike , and two ( rough and love explosion ) were released after . acid queen was the only one to chart , and even then just barely . reception . critical response . the film received critical acclaim . on rotten tomatoes , it has a '' certified fresh '' approval rating of 96 % based on 53 reviews . the site 's consensus is : '' with a fascinating real-life story and powerhouse performances from angela bassett and laurence fishburne , what 's love got to do with it is a ca n't miss biopic . '' audiences surveyed by cinemascore gave the film a grade a on scale of a to f . janet maslin of the new york times , wrote : '' the brilliant , mercurial portrayal of ike turner by laurence fishburne , formerly known as larry , is what elevates 'what 's love got to do with it ' beyond the realm of run-of-the-mill biography . '' gene siskel of the chicago tribune gave it 4 out of 4 , calling it : '' a powerful , joyful , raw , energetically acted bio-pic detailing the joys and pain of the on- and offstage lives of blues rockers ike and tina turner . '' ike turner said that the film and tina turner 's book are '' filled with lies . '' in his autobiography , takin ' back my name , he said fishburne did '' a fantastic job , though the job he did is n't really me . '' he was especially upset about the fabricated rape scene , which he said '' was the lowest thing they could have ever done . '' he added that the film damaged his reputation because of how negatively he was portrayed . at turner 's funeral , phil spector slammed the film and tina 's book as a '' piece of trash '' which '' demonized and vilified ike . '' tina turner stated she wished the film had more truth to it and she was not proud that the film had her being portrayed as a '' victim . '' in 2018 , turner revealed to oprah winfrey that she only recently watched the film . she said , '' i watched a little bit of it , but i did n't finish it because that was not how things went . oprah , i did n't realize they would change the details so much .
