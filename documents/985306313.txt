Sidney Olcott

biography . born john sidney allcott in toronto , he became one of the first great directors of the film business . with a desire to be an actor , a young sidney olcott went to new york city where he worked in the theatre until 1904 when he performed as a film actor with the biograph studios . in 1907 , frank j . marion and samuel long , with financial backing from george kleine , formed a new motion picture company called the kalem studios and were able to lure the increasingly successful sidney olcott away from biograph . olcott was offered the sum of ten dollars per picture and under the terms of his contract , olcott was required to direct a minimum of one , one-reel picture of about a thousand feet every week . after making a number of very successful films for the kalem studio , including ben hur ( 1907 ) with its dramatic chariot race scene , and dr . jekyll and mr . hyde ( 1908 ) , workman , christopher ; howarth , troy ( 2016 ) . '' tome of terror : horror films of the silent era '' . midnight marquee press . p.43 . olcott became the company 's president and was rewarded with one share of its stock . in 1910 sidney olcott demonstrated his creative thinking when he made kalem studios the first ever to travel outside the united states to film on location . of irish ancestry , and knowing that in america there was a huge built-in irish audience , olcott went to ireland where he made a film called a lad from old ireland . he would go on to make more than a dozen films there and later on only the outbreak of world war i prevented him from following through with his plans to build a permanent studio in beaufort , county kerry , ireland . the irish films led to him taking a crew to palestine in 1912 to make the first five-reel film ever , titled from the manger to the cross , the life story of jesus . the film concept was at first the subject of much skepticism but when it appeared on screen , it was lauded by the public and the critics . costing 35,000 to produce , from the manger to the cross earned the kalem company profits of almost 1 million , a staggering amount in 1912 . the motion picture industry acclaimed him as its greatest director and the film influenced the direction many great filmmakers would take such as d.w . griffith and cecil b . demille . from the manger to the cross is still shown today to film societies and students studying early film making techniques . in 1998 the film was selected for the national film registry of the united states library of congress . despite making the studio owners very rich men , they refused to increase his salary beyond the 150 a week he was then earning . from the enormous profits made for his employers , olcott 's dividend on the one share they had given him amounted to 350 . as a result , sidney olcott resigned and took some time off , making only an occasional film until 1915 when he was encouraged by his canadian friend mary pickford to join her at famous players-lasky , later paramount pictures . the kalem company never recovered from the mistake of losing olcott and a few years after his departure , the operation was acquired by vitagraph studios in 1916 . thumb olcott was a founding member of the east coast chapter of the motion picture directors association , a forerunner to today 's directors guild of america and would later serve as its president . like the rest of the film industry , sidney olcott moved to hollywood , california , where he directed many more successful and acclaimed motion pictures with the leading stars of the day . olcott married actress valentine grant , the star of his 1916 film , the innocent lie . during world war ii , olcott opened his home to visiting british commonwealth soldiers in los angeles . in his book titled stardust and shadows : canadians in early hollywood , writer charles foster tells of this period in olcott 's life , and of how he was introduced to many members of hollywood 's canadian community through olcott . sidney olcott died in hollywood , california , in the house of his friend robert vignola where he lived after the death of valentine grant .
