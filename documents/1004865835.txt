Uno (card game)

history . the game was originally developed in 1971 by merle robbins in reading , ohio , a suburb of cincinnati . when his family and friends began to play more and more , he spent 8,000 to have 5,000 copies of the game made . he sold it from his barbershop at first , and local businesses began to sell it as well . robbins later sold the rights to uno to a group of friends headed by robert tezak , a funeral parlor owner in joliet , illinois , for 50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game . tezak formed international games , inc . , to market uno , with offices behind his funeral parlor . the games were produced by lewis saltzman of saltzman printers in maywood , illinois . in 1992 , international games became part of the mattel family of companies . . official rules . the aim of the game is to be the first player to score 500 points , achieved ( usually over several rounds of play ) by being the first to play all of one 's own cards and scoring points for the cards still held by the other players . the deck consists of 108 cards : four each of '' wild '' and '' wild draw four , '' and 25 each of four different colors ( red , yellow , green , blue ) . each color consists of one zero , two each of 1 through 9 , and two each of '' skip , '' '' draw two , '' and '' reverse . '' these last three types are known as '' action cards . '' to start a hand , seven cards are dealt to each player , and the top card of the remaining deck is flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile . the player to the dealer 's left plays first unless the first card on the discard pile is an action or wild card ( see below ) . on a player 's turn , they must do one of the following : play one card matching the discard in color , number , or symbol play a wild card , or a playable wild draw four card ( see restriction below ) draw the top card from the deck , then play it if possible cards are played by laying them face-up on top of the discard pile . play proceeds clockwise around the table . action or wild cards have the following effects : a player who draws from the deck must either play or keep that card and may play no other card from their hand on that turn . a player may play a wild card at any time , even if that player has other playable cards . a player may play a wild draw four card only if that player has no cards matching the current color . the player may have cards of a different color matching the current number or symbol or a wild card and still play the wild draw four card . a player who plays a wild draw four may be challenged by the next player in sequence ( see penalties ) to prove that their hand meets this condition . if the entire deck is used during play , the top discard is set aside and the rest of the pile is shuffled to create a new deck . play then proceeds normally . it is illegal to trade cards of any sort with another player . a player who plays their next-to-last-card must call '' uno '' as a warning to the other players . exact wording of the official rules : 'when you play your next-to-last card , you must yell '' uno '' ( meaning '' one '' ) to indicate that you have only one card left' . the first player to get rid of their last card ( '' going out '' ) wins the hand and scores points for the cards held by the other players . number cards count their face value , all action cards count 20 , and wild and wild draw four cards count 50 . if a draw two or wild draw four card is played to go out , the next player in the sequence must draw the appropriate number of cards before the score is tallied . the first player to score 500 points wins the game . penalties . if a player does not call '' uno '' after laying down their next-to-last card and is caught before the next player in sequence takes a turn ( i.e . , plays a card from their hand , draws from the deck , or touches the discard pile ) , they must draw two cards as a penalty . if the player is not caught in time ( subject to interpretation ) or remembers to call '' uno '' before being caught , they suffer no penalty . if a player plays a wild draw four card , the following player can challenge its use . the player who used the wild draw four must privately show their hand to the challenging player , in order to demonstrate that they had no matching colored cards . if the challenge is correct , then the challenged player draws four cards instead . if the challenge is wrong , then the challenger must draw six cards ; the four cards they were already required to draw plus two more cards . . two-player game . in a two-player game , the reverse card acts like a skip card ; when played , the other player misses a turn . house rules . the following official house rules are suggested in the uno rulebook , to alter the game : progressive uno : if a draw card is played , and the following player has the same card , they can play that card and '' stack '' the penalty , which adds to the current penalty and passes it to the following player . ( although a +4 can not be stacked on a +2 , or vice versa . ) this house rule is so commonly used that there was widespread twitter surprise in 2019 when mattel stated that stacking was not part of the standard rules of uno . seven-o : when a 7 is played , the person who played may choose to swap their hand with that of another player . when a zero is played , all players pass their hands to the left . jump-in : if a player has exactly the same card ( both number and color ) as the top card of the discard pile , they may play it immediately , even if it is not their turn . the game then continues as if that player had just taken their turn . . strategies . a strategy at uno may be offensive ( aiming to go out ) , or defensive ( aiming to minimize the value of one 's hand , in the event that another player goes out , thus getting those points ) . part of the skill of playing uno is knowing when to adopt an offensive or defensive strategy . an offensive strategy would be holding on to wild and wild draw four cards because they can be played near the end of the hand in order to go out ( when it 's harder to play a matching card ) . however , a defensive strategy would advise getting rid of such cards early , because they have a high point value . a defensive strategy would advise playing a high card in order to reduce the point value of the hand . however , an offensive strategy would suggest playing a 0 when the player wants to continue on the current color , because it is less likely to be matched by another 0 of a different color ( there is only one 0 of each color , but two of each 1–9 ) . a player holding only one card is required to call out '' uno '' or risk being penalized if caught . a player who calls '' uno '' risks being the target of concerted action by the other players , who may be able to use action cards to prevent that player from going out . depending on the level and seriousness of play , some players may deliberately avoid saying '' uno '' , in the hope of avoiding detection and then going out on the next turn . for this reason , it is useful to conceal how many cards are in one 's own hand and to keep track of how many cards every other player holds . little has been published on the optimal strategy for the game of uno . simulations of games may shed some light on the matter . attempts to reduce point count in a player 's hands can be '' read '' by other players if too transparent . this information can be exploited by other players , and it follows that a mixed strategy may be more appropriate . card and deck styles . modern uno action cards bear symbols which denote their action , except for the wild cards which still bear the word '' wild . '' before the design change , such cards in english versions of the game had letters only . earlier english versions can be recognised by the absence of the white rim that surrounds the edge of most uno cards . other versions of the game use symbols and images in both old and new designs , especially ones with wild cards that do not bear the word '' wild '' . there are also language-free versions of the newer styles that do not bear the word '' wild '' but have the same styling . the 2010 '' uno mod '' edition uses symbols instead of letters or numbers . on september 16 , 2017 , mattel released uno® coloradd , the first game designed specifically for those suffering from color blindness . on october 1 , 2019 , mattel released a braille version of their game , with mark riccobono , president of the national federation of the blind , said in a press release , '' the fact that a blind person is now able to play a classic game of uno straight out of the box with both blind and sighted friends or family members is a truly meaningful moment for our community .
