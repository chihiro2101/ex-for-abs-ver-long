disasters in 2012 . 1 . world vision has provided 85 chickens to magaalo galo‟ village community in 2012 . unfortunately , the provided chickens were sick and inflected the healthy chickens of the community . the 85 provided chickens died within 48 hours . afterward , the community lost 356 of their own healthy chickens due to the infection of sick chickens provided by world vision . 2 . in the same year , 45 families of the agro-pastoralist community in west of borama town lost 123 of their cattle which represented 41 % of the total cattle population of the community . 3 . in 2011 , a severe long drought had hit the coastal districts lughaya , zeila districts for the last three years and affected the livelihood of pastoralists in these areas . the drought has internally displaced 10,000 families of pastoralists . fisheries development sector . awdal is the third region that has the longest coastline in somaliland . fishers development sector '' ministry of national planning and development , awda '' . p.47 the coast is about 300 & nbsp ; km long from sahil region in the east and republic of djibouti in the west . the two districts of lughaya and zeila are coastal towns in the region and are respectively the capital cities of the two districts . with the exception of a few fishers in the coastal towns , most of the people in lughaya and zeila districts are pastoralists that rear camels , sheep and goats in the coastal plains . pastoralists depend on their animals for living and despise fishing as the livelihood of impoverished people that has no livestock of their own . despite the vast marine resources available , as indicated in somaliland national development plan , fishing plays a very limited role in the economy of coastal towns . this attributed to many factories . first the demand for fish consumption is very low in the coastal towns due to limited population densities , and as result of this , a very small number of artisan fishermen are engaged in subsistence type of fishing and use small boats just to feed their families and meet the available market . second , the coastal towns have no easy access to major urban centers where demand for fish consumption is high . the fishing communities in coastal towns of zeila and lughaya are separated from major towns in the region by sandy coastal plains which stretch more than 60 70 & nbsp ; km from the sea and more than 120 & nbsp ; km from east to west . trucks frequently break in sandy roads and cause a lot of repairs and maintenance to owners . behind sandy coastal plains in the south , transportation in the mountainous zone , with deep gorges , valleys and dry river beds cutting deep in the zone , is very difficult and risky . the mountainous zone stretches east to west and in not less than 70 & nbsp ; km from coastal plains . these topographical features of both zones severely discourage truck owners and , as a result , cause very high transportation charges and long travel duration . together , the sandy coastal plains and mountainous features make market accessibility almost impossible of transporting fish from coastal towns to major urban centers since most of somaliland 's major urban centers are in ogo zone which occurs south of both of coastal and mountainous zones . third , large scale of fishing is hampered by absence of constant ice-making and fish storage facilities ; lack of organization and skills in repairing and maintenance services of fishing boats and fishing gear ; high fuel costs ; and above all lack of freezer trucks to transport fish to major urban centers where demand for fish is very high . demand for fish has become higher since the livestock export ban was lifted in 2009 . the price of meat has almost quadrupled since 2009 . fourth , both zeila and lughaya occur on straight coastline without natural shelter , absence of fishing ports ( jetty ) and landing sites . consequently , fishing boats are exposed to open sea with all its turbulent winds and waves . finally , the sector is constrained by the absence of institutional capacity including ice-making and fish storage facilities in coastal towns . besides , availability of fishing gear , spare parts and lack of fishing gear repairs and maintenance skills are major bottlenecks of the fishing industry in the region . industry and commerce sector . since the collapse of socialist regime , industry and commerce sector '' ministry of national planning and development , awdal '' . p.50 the numbers and the scope businesses enterprises have spread dramatically like a bush fire . most of them are owned and managed by family members although some of them are co-owned by group of individuals . most of them are involved in different types commercial activities such retailing , wholesaling , service provision . manufacturing industries is very limited and mostly depend on imported raw materials according to their capital base , enterprises in the region can roughly be divided into three main categories or levels : low , medium , and upper . the low capital level categories include petty trading activities solely established to generate daily subsistence for their owner-managers and are not in the real sense of the word profit-oriented . their capital base varies from less than a hundred dollar to several hundred us dollars and can be classified as survival businesses . they are mostly dominated by female and a few male individuals and have no shop centers and are run in open air . the medium level enterprises have more capital bases than the low levels . their capital base varies from several thousand to several tens of thousands of us dollars . most of them are family owned or co-owned and managed by a group of individuals , have shop centers , licensed , involved in provisions of goods and services . the upper-level enterprises have more capital base than the other two levels . their capital is estimated to several hundred thousands of us dollars . they are a few in numbers and are involved in either service sector such as remittance , merchandising , import-export trading , or run small scale manufacturing industries . all three levels provide different types of employment opportunities from self-employment to paid jobs and enabled the public to have easy access to essential goods and services . despite the sector plays an important role in the economy of the region , it is constrained by , first , absence of financial institutions for financing existing and potential business opportunities . second , lack proximate port facilities in the coastal towns of lughaya and zeila cause high transportation cost of imported commodities . third , lack affordable energy discourages potential investment opportunities . finally , the institutional capacity of the sector to provide necessary technical support services is missing . mining . the mining sector is the least developed in the region . the only mining activity in the region is gemstones . mining development sector '' ministry of national planning and development , awda '' . p53 many people are involved in mining gemstones in a very primitive manner . stones such as emerald , sapphire , and aquamarine are mined in the mountainous part ( golis range ) of the region . people use crude tools for mining which cause unnecessary wastage , effort , and costs . most of the limited production of gemstones have cracks and are rarely marketable . the qualities of gemstones depend upon the depth , equipment employed and professional skills utilized for excavation . even the method of identifying the exact site to mine gemstones is very precarious . prospective miners use a hit-and-miss method to locate excavation sites . gemstone mining generates a limited but unreliable income for the miners . very few individuals buy stones from the miners and take to unreliable outside markets . nobody knows the exact price of gemstones at external markets . it takes months to produce a hundred grams of gemstone and the amount of effort and money expended on its excavation often exceeds the income generated . another challenge is that the groups involved in the mining of gemstones are not formally organized as business entities . some individuals work together , sharing effort and costs , and equally any income generated . there are frequent conflicts , mismanagement , and theft among the groups . planning and development . the regional ministry of ministry of planning ( somaliland ) panning and development 55 '' ministry of national planning and development , somaliland '' . is responsible for the implementation of national development policy in the region . the mandate of the ministry includes : • collection and analysis of data and other relevant information in collaboration with the regional offices and other sectors . • establishing regional development oversight committee . • ensuring the implementation and supervision of a three-year regional development plan of sectors . • registration of lngos working in the region and coordinating their development activities . • coordination of the regional development activities of international and local organizations according to the regional development plan . environment . environmental protection . awdal environment protection region , '' ministry of national planning and development , awdal '' . p.58 has three distinct topographical zones . starting from the north along the sea is coastal zone which stretches from sahil region in the east to republic of djibouti in north west . the coastal zone comprises sandy coastal plains that stretch up 70 & nbsp ; km south into mountainous zone , otherwise known golis range , which is about 500–1000 meters above the sea level . the coastal zone is brutally hot , sometimes more than 45-degree celsius , during the summer , from may to september , and receives lesser rain than other zones in the region . this zone is locally known '' guban '' which means '' burned '' in english and its dwellers are called '' qorax-joog '' ( sun dwellers ) . the coastal zone usually gets its rain during the winter season when other zones are in dry season . known locally as hais '' , the rainy season is usually from december to january . because of its low rainfall , the vegetation in coastal plains consists of different types of grasses and a few hardy scattered acacia trees . all dry rivers from mountainous zone end up in coastal plains and during the rainy season runs -offs from mountainous zone end up in the low coastal plains and bring alluvial soil . a colonial governor from zeila travelled along the coastal zone in 1887and described the rich vegetations and heavy forests along the banks of dry rivers in the coastal plains , some of which with running streams . he also wrote about the rich vegetation and the presence of wild animals such as elephants , antelopes , lions , leopards , black panthers , and different types of birds . next coastal zone in the south is the mountainous zone otherwise known golis . the mountainous zone is 600 to 1000 meters above the sea level and gets gu‟ rains during the months of april to september . some areas of this zone adjacent to coastal areas also get some of winter ( hais ) rains received by the coastal zone . because of this , the zone gets more rains than the coastal zone , and has , as a result , more vegetation . the zone is also characterized by the existence of many dry rivers with running water streams throughout the year . there had been thick forests in the valleys and along banks of the river beds that had been a conducive environment for various wild animals such as lions , kudu , oryx , leopards , cheetah , mountain dik-dik ( ala-kud ) , gazelles and even elephants . it is said that the last elephant in somaliland has died in the 1940s in dibirawein valley , now in baki district , and some of its bones are still sitting there . however , since the 1970s , almost all valleys and banks of the dry rivers with running streams were turned into irrigated farms and , in the process , the thick forests were cleared , burned for charcoal and/or used for construction purposes and , consequently , the wild animals hunted , killed or migrated as their habitats completely were devastated by human intrusion . people in this zone were pastoralists and reared goats and sheep and a few camels . with the introduction of farming , the livestock population has also declined as the wild animals . the third topographical zone in the region is the ogo zone which runs parallel next to mountainous zone in the south . it is an upland terrain ( plateau ) which is about 1100 to 1300 meters above the sea level and gets more rain during the gu‟ season . most of the people in this zone are sedentary agro-pastoralists that mix cultivation of cereals crops in rain-fed farms with livestock keeping in small cattle numbers such as cattle , sheep , and goats . the ogo zone is densely populated and suffered the worst environmental degradation . understanding the fragility of the somaliland environment , the colonial administrations introduced parks , reserved grazing lands , and established forestry camps in the region . there had been three such sites in borama , jir-jir , libaaxley , and baki which were reserved for wildlife and livestock grazing . the reserved lands were closed off during the rainy seasons and solely opened for livestock grazing during the dry season when pastures become scarce . the reserves were not only reserved for livestock pastures but for wild animals as well . forester camps were also established for the protection wild animals and for maintenance of wildlife habitats . for the last 40 years , the environment has been vast deteriorating and sustaining some irreversible damages . many factors have contributed to such environmental degradation . as population density has increased and economic conditions become harsh , people turned to natural resources such as forests for a living . moreover , the socialist regime of siyad barre has introduced cooperative farming practices , and , as a result , many common grazing lands and valleys and that were the breeding environment of wildlife , were given to specific people in the name of farming cooperatives . furthermore , the situation of the environment deteriorated further during the civil wars when law and order collapsed following the fall of the socialist regime . afterwards , an unprecedented land grabbing started in rural areas . forests were cleared for farms , burned for charcoal , cut down for construction materials and for living as well . as reported by the baki district commissioner , charcoal business is causing unprecedented environmental destruction in baki district . every day about 15 trucks carrying hundreds of tones of charcoal head off for borama , gebilay , hargeisa , and zeila towns . more than 700 men are involved in charcoal burning activities and have established camps in all well-wooded areas of the district . as indicated in ndp of somaliland government , there is an urgent need for formulation of sound national environment protection policy and establishment of an effective environmental management mechanism in order to achieve a sustainable national and subnational development . infrastructure . roads sector . roads are very crucial for the movement of people and goods . road sector '' ministry of national planning and development , awdal '' . p.64 because of the topographical features of the region , road transport is an impediment to development of the region . the topographical features of the region make road transport very discouraging : sandy coastal plains and range of mountains . coastal plains are very sandy and a lot of dry rivers from mountains zone pass through coastal plains and have been depositing sands for centuries . the distance of coastal plains from east to west is estimated at 200 & nbsp ; km and the distance between the mountainous zone and coastal zone is estimated at 70 & nbsp ; km . it takes about 3 to 4 hours for a truck to travel from lughaya to zeila which is about 150 & nbsp ; km apart due to sandy plains and sandy dry river beds . during rainy seasons transport movement stops for days . besides , the distance between zeila and borama is about 250 & nbsp ; km and it takes about 8 hours for a truck to travel between the two towns due to the poor condition of the road . the coastal and mountainous zones are indeed economically very potential but are the least developed so far . absence of serviceable inter-regional roads networks and feeders roads are the main challenges to the development of fisheries , agriculture , and mining sectors . according to the chinese proverb , poverty can be easily reduced through building roads : if you want fight poverty build a road . when roads are opened to impoverished isolated communities life could dramatically improve . public works , housing , and transport . the regional ministry of public works , public works , housing and transport sector '' ministry of national planning and development , awdal '' . p.64 housing and transport has had the mandate of providing guidance and oversight over public works , transport , and housing in all districts of the region . however , the sector is scarcely operational . since the collapse of the late siyad barre regime in 1990 , most of the public buildings in all districts are occupied by idps and/or refugee returnees . still others are in utter disrepair . there had been a total of 64 of public offices and houses in the region ( 40 in borama , 12 in baki and 12 in lughaya ) . even the head office of the sector in borama is occupied by idps . the vehicle garages and workshops are also occupied . the head office of the sector in the region has neither the capacity nor the resources required for the restoration of sector operations . the regional head office of the sector theoretically comprises six functional departments : 1 . transport 2 . construction 3 . architecture 4 . planning 5 . government houses 6 . administration & finance formally each of the six departments is supposed to have five technical staff members . there are only 10 staff people in the region including a security guard at the present , and they share two available offices . other districts do not have administration offices , nor other essential sector infrastructure . energy sector ( borama electricity ) . energy is very crucial for the development of a nation . however , the achievements of somaliland‟s development goals depend upon the availability of cheap energy sources . energy is indispensable for industrial , household , transportation uses . in somaliland , the main sources of energy are fossil fuels . they include diesel , petrol , kerosene , charcoal , and fire wood . they are utilized for generation of electricity , transport and for household use . with the exception of charcoal and firewood , all the others are imported from outside and huge amounts of hard currency is expended on their importation . like other regions , charcoal and fire woods are the main fuel sources utilized for household , businesses and other institutions that are involved in food services in the region . charcoal consumption is the highest in the urban centers while firewood is mainly used in rural areas . charcoal and firewood fuels have had utter deforestation in the region . borama town used to have an electricity power station known as borama power station . it was established just before the socialist regime came into power in 1969 . it was used for lighting public houses and the main streets of the town . the station was expanded in the 1980s by henley on thames ( uk ) a sister city of borama . henley on thames provided two electricity generators of 1500 kvas each and their spare parts and accessories awaiting installation . after the collapse of the socialist regime in 1990 , private individuals joined together and took over the power station and had been providing electricity for fee up to 2003 . eventually , the borama power station collapsed for mismanagement and distribution infrastructures such as overhead wires and poles are now being used by private electricity companies created right after the collapse of the power station . now , the borama power station building and compound are idle . currently , more than three private companies provide electricity in borama . the many attempts of forming public-private partnership ( ppp ) with private companies by borama municipality , representing borama power station , ended in vain . the private electricity companies charges 1.20/watt . and , as result of this , electricity is only used for lighting households and for minor commercial operations purposes . civil aviation sector . borama airport , civi aviation sector '' ministry of national planning and development , somaliland '' . which is 2 & nbsp ; km long and 200 meters wide , was constructed in 1988 by former collapsed socialist government . the purpose the airport was built was to enable the region to have an access to air transport for the movement of goods and people and link the region to the outside world . current operations of the airport are very limited . most of passenger , cargo planes and un aircraft use hargeisa and berbera airports due to appropriate airport facilities and services . moreover , the airport runway is unpaved and rough and its land demarcation is not yet fixed by the local government . thus , the airport area is being frequently infringed by land grabbers . the airport has no security fence and , consequently , exposed to roaming livestock . besides , due to absence of the fence , truck drivers use the runway as road and pose unnecessary risks to aircraft . additionally , the airport is missing some very essential services and facilities such weather forecasting services , fire trucks , air communication and water supply system . lack of institutional capacities such shortage of trained staff , budgetary restrictions and lack of transport are some of the constraints hampering borama airport operations . if the above challenges are duly addressed , airport operation would probably resume operations . information and culture sector . awdal information and culture sector '' ministry of national planning and development , awdal '' . region does not have both public and private radio stations . however , people listen to radio hargeisa since 2012 when its capacity was expended to short wave which transmits its programs in somali , english , amharic and arabic from 8:30 & nbsp ; am to 11:00 & nbsp ; am and from 1:00 & nbsp ; pm to 11:00 & nbsp ; pm . besides , bbc and voa fm radios also broadcast programs in somali , arabic and english . there is one privately owned tv station ( rayo tv ) in borama , and is viewed on normal antenna in borama township . however , people in the region also view somaliland national tv and somaliland space channel which are viewed both on normal antenna and via satellite respectively . other privately owned satellite dishes include hargeisa cable tv . both government and privately owned tvs have representatives in the region . other medias widely used by educated people are websites and local daily newspapers . they provide news , advertisements and other diverse information on to the users . there are no daily local newspapers published in the region . however , more than 10 daily local newspapers are published in hargeisa and are sent via road transport and usually arrive in the region in afternoons . all of the newspapers have field reports in the region . posts and telecommunication sector . the regional head office of the posts and telecommunication sector is in very bad shape and could not be restored . the post office was built during the colonial administration with mud bricks and was mainly used for postal services . it sits on an area of not more than 10 square meters . the successive governments did not add anything to it . since the collapse of the somali government , the small building was occupied by idp family for some time and badly destroyed it . the post office building is now in utter destruction . the head of the sector in region described as the '' home of bats and rats '' . even the land surrounding the post office , including its front compound are taken and built by intruders currently , the total employees of the sector in the region are 7 . they are all based in borama and have no office spaces . they carry around with office documents and their salaries paid through the private money transfer agencies at the end of every month . the sector challenges are not specific to the region with the exception of office premises . it shares with other regions in terms of priorities and strategies as indicated in the somaliland ndp . what is missing and urgent is the establishment of office premises in all districts of the regions . water sector . the topographical features of the region determine categories of water sources . the region can be divided into three distinct topographical zones : coastal , mountainous , and plateau ( ogo ) . starting from the northern part of the region along the sea is the coastal zone which is about 500 to 700 meters above the sea level . the coastal zone comprises sandy plains that extend from 70 to 90 & nbsp ; km from sea . this zone is very hot with temperatures of about 40-degree celsius during the summer season ( june- august ) . ease of access to reliable water sources is important in summer for both people and livestock . in the rainy season , water can be obtained from hand-dug shallow wells in dry rivers beds , but these dry up as soon as rains stop or the sun gets hotter . as a result of this , the only reliable water sources in the coastal zones are strategically placed bore wells both for human and livestock consumption . of the eight bore wells in the region , 6 are in the coastal zone . according to a regional water officer , the bore wells el-gal , and laanta morohda are in zeila district ; and karure and kalowle are in lughaya district . two more bore wells are husayn and gerissa . kalowle bore well provides water to pastoralists and lughaya town which is about 8 & nbsp ; km from the bore well site . unicef has drilled a back up strategic bore well at the site in case the old bore well breaks down . karure bore well does not have a back up yet . these bore wells are strategic in the sense that they are drilled in the driest areas of the coastal zone , where water sources are not obtainable . however , the bore wells have no back ups and if a bore well breaks down , the live of both livestock and the people are at great risk . zeila town gets its water from a bore well near tokoshi , a village about 8 & nbsp ; km west of zeila town . the bore well does not provide sufficient water and its water turns salty in the dry season . since zeila occurs in the coastal zone , it is very hot during the summer season and life is difficult without adequate water supply . besides , zeila is the entry point of people and goods coming from republic djibouti and , as a result of this , there is a customs office where the ministry of finance collects import taxes from goods entering the country . accordingly , the provision of sufficient and drinkable water supply is very crucial for lives of town people and for the movement of people between somaliland and republic of djibouti . the mountainous zone consists of a string of mountains that extend east to west , south of the coastal zone . the zone has many dry river beds and valleys between the mountains . the river beds provide permanent water in terms of springs and shallow wells dug in the dry river beds . besides human and livestock consumption , the water sources are used for the irrigation of fruit and vegetable farms . unlike the other zones of the region , the mountainous zone has reliable water sources in the region . the ogo zone is an upland terrain which runs along the south of the mountainous zone . it is about 1000–1300 meters above the sea level . the main water sources of this zone are man-made rain water catchment earth dams ( balleyo ) , cemented catchments ( berkad ) , and bore wells besides some natural rain ponds . most berkads and balleys are privately owned water sources . an exception are five communal balleys dug by a world bank project in the 1980s in three sites around borama , which have not been de-silted since excavation . most rainwater catchments usually dry up during the dry season and both people and livestock resort to bore wells for water or to communal hand-dug shallow wells along the fringes of the mountainous zone . management of bore wells is very poor . the bore wells are practically owned by the operators , who fix the price of water for livestock and human consumption . different water prices are charged by the operators on the different bore wells in coastal areas . the operators are not accountable to any government institution or body , including the beneficiaries of bore wells . unlike the strategic bore wells in the coastal zone , mini- water systems exist in the major towns and villages in mountainous zone . the main sources of mini water systems are hand dug shallow wells connected to pumps run by diesel pumps or by solar installations . mini water systems are for human consumption and funded by international organizations with the collaboration of local communities and local governments . they are managed by committee and charge affordable rate to beneficiaries . some of the proceeds are paid to operators for salaries and the remainder is used for spare parts and for repairs and maintenance services . government . justice sector . the mandate of the ministry of justice is ensuring that the fundamental rights and freedoms of somalilanders , and , as result , have established an effective legal mechanism that protects the citizens against oppression and abuses . somaliland government carried out all necessary steps of ensuring that an effective and transparent justice system is in place and the rule of law is duly applied with all the necessary court proceedings and investigation processes of civil and criminal cases . somaliland judiciary courts comprise : 1 . district courts 2 . regional courts 3 . appeal courts 4 . supreme court . local government sector . borama district . borama is the regional capital of the region and has the largest population in the region . the exact figure of the total inhabitants that live borama town is uncertain , however , it is estimated that total population of not less than 450,000 to 750,000 live inside borama . borama population has greatly increased since the collapse of the former regime of siad barre due to refugees from somalia in 1991 and returnees from refugee camps in ethiopia and djibouti . borama is grade '' a '' district and is one of the six districts under the provision of joint program for local governance ( jplg ) program . five un agencies ( undp , un-habitat , unicef , ncdf , and ilo ) work close with the local government to carry out their responsibilities . each of the five un agencies involves in a distinct role different from those of the other four . some of the areas in the jplg program include financial management , planning and management of projects , local council 's parliamentary procedures and leadership . despite the important roles that somaliland constitution has assigned to local governments to plays in socio-economic development of its constituency , borama local government is not without challenges . regional governor office . the regional governor office is in borama , the regional capital . it was built during colonial administration and had been the office of the then borama district commissioner . the building is very old and made of mud bricks and is one of the few public offices not occupied by squatters . it is a historic place and that could be a reason squatters got ashamed of its occupation or it might have been prevented from occupation by patriotic individuals . whatever the reason might have been , it is a historic icon for the region . demographics . awdal is primarily inhabited by people from the somali ethnic group , with the gadabuursi subclan of the dir especially well represented and considered the predominant clan of the region . samatar , abdi i . ( 2001 ) '' somali reconstruction and local initiative : amoud university , '' , p . 132 . federico battera ( 2005 ) states about the awdal region : '' awdal is mainly inhabited by the gadabuursi confederation of clans . '' a un report published by canada : immigration and refugee board of canada ( 1999 ) , states concerning awdal : '' the gadabuursi clan dominates awdal region . as a result , regional politics in awdal is almost synonymous with gadabuursi internal clan affairs . '' un ( 1999 ) somaliland : update to sml26165.e of 14 february 1997 on the situation in zeila , including who is controlling it , whether there is fighting in the area , and whether refugees are returning . '' the gadabuursi clan dominates awdal region . as a result , regional politics in awdal is almost synonymous with gadabuursi internal clan affairs . '' p . 5 . roland marchal ( 1997 ) states that numerically , the gadabuursi are the predominant inhabitants of the awdal region : '' the gadabuursi 's numerical predominance in awdal virtually ensures that gadabuursi interests drive the politics of the region . '' marleen renders and ulf terlinden ( 2010 ) both state that the gadabuursi almost exclusively inhabit the awdal region : '' awdal in western somaliland is situated between djibouti , ethiopia and the issaq-populated mainland of somaliland . it is primarily inhabited by the three sub-clans of the gadabursi clan , whose traditional institutions survived the colonial period , somali statehood and the war in good shape , remaining functionally intact and highly relevant to public security . '' there is also a sizeable minority of the issa subclan of the dir who mainly inhabit the zeila district . . districts . the awdal region consists of four districts : borama district baki district lughaya district zeila district . major towns . borama baki lughaya zeila dilla jarahorato amud abasa fiqi aadan quljeed boon harirad lawyacado
