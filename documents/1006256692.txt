early life . she was born in new york city to nathaniel reichenthal , a jewish immigrant from galicia , and sadie ( née edersheim ) , and educated at cornell university . she met historian louis r . gottschalk , then a graduate assistant at cornell , and they married in 1920 . she began to write poetry , publishing first ( 1923–26 ) under the name laura riding gottschalk . she became associated with the fugitives through allen tate , and they published her poems in the fugitive magazine . her marriage with gottschalk ended in divorce in 1925 , at the end of which year she went to england at the invitation of robert graves and his wife nancy nicholson . she would remain in europe for nearly fourteen years . friedman 2005 . poetic development and personal relationships . the excitement stirred by laura riding 's poems is hinted at in sonia raiziss ' later description : '' when the fugitive ( 1922–1925 ) flashed down the new sky of american poetry , it left a brilliant scatter of names : ransom , tate , warren , riding , crane . among them , the inner circle and those tangent to it as contributors , there was no one quite like laura riding . '' ( '' an appreciation , '' chelsea 12 1962 , 28 . ) riding 's first collection of poetry , the close chaplet , was published in 1926 , and during the following year she assumed the surname riding . clark 2000 by this time the originality of her poetry was becoming ever more evident : generally she favoured a distinctive form of free verse over conventional metres . she , robert graves and nancy nicholson lived in london until riding 's suicide attempt in 1929 . it is generally agreed that this episode was a major cause of the break-up of graves 's first marriage : the whole affair caused a famous literary scandal . she published her 477-page collected poems in 1938 ; paul auster in the new york review of books calls her '' an important force of the international avant-garde '' . her poems had many critics , including americans such as john gould fletcher and john crowe ransom as well as graves ' family and friends . when riding met the irish poet , geoffrey phibbs , in 1929 , she invited him to join the household that already contained herself , graves , and graves 's wife , nancy . phibbs agreed , but after a few months changed his mind and returned to his wife , referring to riding as '' a virago '' in a letter to his friend thomas macgreevy . macgreevy papers , trinity college , dublin when they failed to effect a reconciliation , he rejoined the household but rejected laura and moved in with nancy . this was one of the catalysts for the incident of 27 april 1929 , when riding jumped from a fourth-floor window at the lodgings she shared with graves , at the height of an argument involving graves , phibbs and nancy graves ; having failed to stop her , graves also jumped , but was unharmed , whilst riding sustained life-threatening injuries . following the break-up with nancy , until the outbreak of the spanish civil war in 1936 , riding and graves lived in deià , majorca , where they were visited by writers and artists including james reeves , norman cameron , john aldridge , len lye , jacob bronowski and honor wyatt . the house is now a museum . la casa de robert graves progress of stories ( 1935 ) would later be highly esteemed by , among others , john ashbery and harry mathews . see his '' queen story '' in immeasurable distances : the collected essays , venice , ca : the lapis press , 1991 . between 1936 and 1939 , riding and graves lived in england , france and switzerland ; graves accompanied riding on her return to the usa in 1939 . riding and graves were highly productive from the start of their association , though after they moved to majorca they became even more so . while still in london they had set up ( 1927 ) the seizin press , collaborated on a survey of modernist poetry ( 1927 ) ( which inspired william empson to write seven types of ambiguity and was in some respects the seed of the new criticism ) , a pamphlet against anthologies ( 1928 ) and other works . in majorca , the seizin press was enlarged to become a publishing imprint , producing inter alia the substantial hardbound critical magazine epilogue ( 1935–1938 ) , edited by riding with graves as associate editor . throughout their association both steadily produced volumes of major poetry , culminating for each with a collected poems in 1938 . graves and riding left majorca in 1936 , at the outbreak of the spanish civil war . in 1939 , they moved to the united states and took lodging in new hope , pennsylvania . their changing relationship is described by elizabeth friedmann in a mannered grace , by richard perceval graves in robert graves : 1927–1940 , the years with laura and by t . s . matthews in jacks or better ( 1977 ; uk edition published as under the influence , 1979 ) and also was the basis for miranda seymour 's novel the summer of '39 ( 1998 ) . in 1939 riding and graves parted and in 1941 she married schuyler b . jackson , eventually settling in wabasso , florida , where she lived quietly and simply until her death in 1991 , schuyler having died in 1968 . the vernacular '' cracker '' house in which they lived has been renovated and preserved by the laura ( riding ) jackson foundation . according to graves ' biographer richard perceval graves , riding played a crucial role in the development of graves ' thoughts when writing his book the white goddess , despite the fact the two were estranged at that point . laura ( riding ) jackson was later to say : '' as to the ‘ white goddess ’ identity : the white goddess theme was a spiritually , literarily and scholastically fraudulent improvisation by robert graves into the ornate pretentious framework of which he stuffed stolen substance of my writings , and my thought generally , on poetry , woman , cosmic actualities and the history of religious conceptions . '' she had already written to the editor of the minnesota review , in 1967 , about how graves had used her as a source : '' in my thinking , the categorically separated functions termed intellectual , moral , spiritual , emotional , were brought into union , into joint immediacy ; other conceptions put the sun and moon in their right rational places as emblems of poetic emotionalism , and lengthened the perspective of origin back from the skimpy historical heavens of masculine divinity through a spacious dominion of religious symbolism , pre-sided over , for the sake of poetic justice , by a thing i called mother-god . '' ' a letter to the editor ' on michael kirkham on robert graves , minnesota review , 7 ( l ) ,1967 , pp . 77-79 . . renunciation of poetry . in about 1941 , riding renounced poetry , but it was fifteen to twenty years before she felt able to begin explaining her reasons and exploring her unfolding findings . nolan 2007 she withdrew from public literary life , working with schuyler jackson on a dictionary ( published posthumously in 1997 ) that would lead them into an exploration of the foundations of meaning and language . in april 1962 , she read '' introduction for a broadcast '' for the bbc third programme , her first formal statement of her reasons for renouncing poetry ( there had been a brief reference book entry in 1955 ) . an expanded version of the piece was published that year in the new york magazine chelsea , which also published '' further on poetry '' in 1964 , writings on the theme of women-and-men in 1965 and 1974 and in 1967 , the telling . later writings . the 62 numbered passages of the telling , a '' personal evangel '' , formed the '' core part '' of a book of the same title , thought by some to be her most important book alongside collected poems . athlone , 1972 ; harper & row , 1973 ; carcanet , 2005 . writings and publications continued to flow throughout the sixties , seventies and eighties , as laura ( riding ) jackson ( her authorial name from 1963–64 ) explored what she regarded as the truth-potential of language , free from the artificial restrictions of poetic art . '' my faith in poetry was at heart a faith in language as the elementary wisdom , '' she had written in 1976 ( '' the road to , in , and away from , poetry '' , reader 251 ) . her later writings attest to what she regarded as the truth-potential contained in language and in the human mind . she might be regarded as a spiritual teacher whose unusually high valuation of language , led her to choose literature as the locus of her work . two issues of chelsea were given over to new writings by her , it has taken long ( 1976 ) and the sufficient difference ( 2001 ) . publication of her work has continued since her death in 1991 , including first awakenings ( her early poems ) ( 1992 ) , rational meaning : a new foundation for the definition of words ( 1997 ) , the poems of laura riding , a newly revised edition of the 1938/1980 collection ( 2001 ) , under the mind 's watch ( 2004 ) , the failure of poetry , the promise of language ( 2007 ) , and on the continuing of the continuing ( 2008 ) . the latest book to appear is her two-volume literary memoirs , the person i am ( 2011 ) , following which three further early collections of her poetry have been re-published , edited and with lengthy introductions : 'the close chaplet ' ( 1926 ) , 'love as love , death as death ' ( 1928 ) and 'poet : a lying word ' ( 1933 ) .
