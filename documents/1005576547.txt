'' lyceum theatre '' , the morning post , 15 september 1846 , p . 5 it was as a dramatist that taylor made the most impression – his biographer in the dictionary of national biography ( dnb ) wrote that in writing plays taylor found his true vocation . in thirty-five years he wrote more than seventy plays for the principal london theatres . a substantial portion of taylor 's prolific output consisted of adaptations from the french or collaborations with other playwrights , notably charles reade . some of his plots were adapted from the novels of charles dickens or others . many of taylor 's plays were extremely popular , such as masks and faces , an extravaganza written in collaboration with reade , produced at the haymarket theatre in november 1852 . it was followed by the almost equally successful to oblige benson ( olympic theatre , 1854 ) , an adaptation from a french vaudeville . others mentioned by the dnb are plot and passion ( 1853 ) , still waters run deep ( 1855 ) and the ticket-of-leave man ( based on le retour de melun by édouard brisebarre and eugène nus ) , a melodrama produced at the olympic in 1863 . taylor also wrote a series of historical dramas ( many in blank verse ) , including the fool ’ s revenge ( 1869 ) , an adaption of victor hugo 's le roi s'amuse ( also adapted by verdi as rigoletto ) , twixt axe and crown ( 1870 ) , jeanne d'arc ( 1871 ) , lady clancarty ( 1874 ) and anne boleyn ( 1875 ) . the last of these , produced at the haymarket in 1875 , was taylor 's penultimate piece and only complete failure . in 1871 taylor supplied the words to arthur sullivan 's dramatic cantata , on shore and sea . '' the international exhibition '' , the times , 2 may 1871 , reprinted at the gilbert and sullivan archive , accessed 5 august 2017 like his colleague w . s . gilbert , taylor believed that plays should be readable as well as actable ; he followed gilbert in having copies of his plays printed for public sale . both authors did so at some risk , because it made matters easy for american pirates of their works in the days before international copyright protection . taylor wrote , '' i have no wish to screen myself from literary criticism behind the plea that my plays were meant to be acted . it seems to me that every drama submitted to the judgment of audiences should be prepared to encounter that of readers '' . barrett , daniel . '' play publication , readers , and the 'decline ' of victorian drama '' , book history , vol . 2 ( 1999 ) , pp . 181 and 182 many of taylor 's plays were extremely popular , and several survived into the 20th century , although most are largely forgotten today . his our american cousin ( 1858 ) is now remembered chiefly as the play abraham lincoln was attending when he was assassinated , but it was revived many times during the 19th century with great success . it became celebrated as a vehicle for the popular comic actor edward sothern , and after his death , his sons , lytton and e . h . sothern , took over the part in revivals .
