Neal Adams

dina babbitt and work related to the holocaust . in collaboration with rafael medoff , director of the david wyman institute for holocaust studies , adams has championed an effort to get the auschwitz-birkenau state museum , which is operated by the government of poland , to return the original artwork of dina babbitt . in exchange for his sparing her mother and herself from the gas chambers , babbitt worked as an illustrator for nazi death camp doctor josef mengele , who wanted detailed paintings to demonstrate his pseudoscientific theories about gypsy racial inferiority . using text from medoff , adams illustrated a six-page graphic documentary about babbitt that was inked by joe kubert and contains an introduction by stan lee . however , adams deemphasizes any comparison between the babbitt case and his struggle for creator rights , saying that her situation was '' tragic '' and '' an atrocity . '' in 2010 , adams and medoff teamed with disney educational productions to produce they spoke out : american voices against the holocaust , an online educational motion comics series that tells stories of americans who protested nazis or helped rescue jews during the holocaust . each standalone episode , which runs from five to ten minutes , utilizes a combination of archival film footage and animatics drawn by adams ( who also narrates ) , and focus on a different person . the first episode , '' la guardia 's war against hitler '' was screened in april 2010 at a festival sponsored by the museum of comic and cartoon art , and tells the story of the forceful stand new york city mayor fiorello la guardia took against nazi germany . la guardia 's actions stood in contrast to the relative passivity of president franklin roosevelt , who historians such as david s . wyman believe did not do as much as he could have to save european jewry , a point underlined in the episode '' messenger from hell '' . other episodes include '' voyage of the doomed '' , which focuses on the s.s . st . louis , the ship that carried more than 900 german-jewish refugees but was turned away by cuban authorities and later the roosevelt administration , and '' rescue over the mountains '' , which depicts varian fry , the young journalist who led an underground rescue network that smuggled jewish refugees out of vichy france . chandler , doug .
