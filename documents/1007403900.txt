while rothko and newman used fairly flat colors and relatively thin paint , still uses a thick impasto , causing subtle variety and shades that shimmer across the painting surfaces . his large mature works recall natural forms and natural phenomena at their most intense and mysterious ; ancient stalagmites , caverns , foliage , seen both in darkness and in light lend poetic richness and depth to his work . by 1947 , he had begun working in the format that he would intensify and refine throughout the rest of his career – a large-scale color field applied with palette knives . clyfford still , 1948 ( 1948 ) guggenheim collection . among still 's well known paintings is 1957-d no . 1 , 1957 ( right ) , which is mainly black and yellow with patches of white and a small amount of red . these four colors , and variations on them ( purples , dark blues ) are predominant in his work , although there is a tendency for his paintings to use darker shades . exhibitions . in 1943 , still 's first solo show took place at the san francisco museum of art . in 1947 , jermayne macagy , assistant director of the california palace of the legion of honor , gave him a solo show there . the artist then declined all public exhibitions from 1952 to 1959 . clyfford still tate collection . a first comprehensive still retrospective took place at the albright–knox art gallery , buffalo , new york , in 1959 . later solo exhibitions of still 's paintings were presented by the institute of contemporary art of the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia in 1963 and at the marlborough-gerson gallery , new york , in 1969 to 1970 . in 1975 , a permanent installation of a group of his works opened at the san francisco museum of modern art . clyfford still guggenheim collection . in 1979 , new york 's metropolitan museum of art organized the largest survey of still 's art to date and the largest presentation afforded by this institution to the work of a living artist . awards . still received the award of merit for painting in 1972 from the american academy of arts and letters , of which he became a member in 1978 , and the skowhegan medal for painting in 1975 . . estate and clyfford still museum . still wrote a will in 1978 that left a portion of his work , along with his archives , to his wife patricia and stated : '' i give and bequeath all the remaining works of art executed by me in my collection to an american city that will agree to build or assign and maintain permanent quarters exclusively for these works of art and assure their physical survival with the explicit requirement that none of these works of art will be sold , given , or exchanged but are to be retained in the place described above exclusively assigned to them in perpetuity for exhibition and study .
