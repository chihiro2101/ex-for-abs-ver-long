'' sly & the family stone . '' rolling stone . web . the nickname sly was a common one for sylvester throughout his years in grade school . early on , a classmate misspelled his name '' slyvester , '' and ever since , the nickname followed him . in the mid-1960s , stone worked as a disc jockey for san francisco , california , soul radio station ksol , where he included white performers such as the beatles and the rolling stones in his playlists . during the same period , he worked as a staff record producer for autumn records , producing for predominantly white san francisco-area bands such as the beau brummels , the mojo men , bobby freeman , and grace slick 's first band , the great society . stone was influential in guiding ksol-am into soul music and started calling the station k-soul . the second was a popular soul music station ( sans the k-soul moniker ) , at 107.7 fm ( now known as ksan ) . the current ksol has a different format and is unrelated to the previous two stations . while still providing '' music for your mind , body , and your soul '' on ksol , sly stone played keyboard for dozens of major performers including dionne warwick , righteous brothers , ronettes , bobby freeman , george & teddy , freddy cannon , marvin gaye , dick & dee dee , jan & dean , gene chandler , and many more , including at least one of the three twist party concerts by then chart topper chubby checker held at the cow palace in san francisco in 1962 and 1963 . the concerts were put together by '' big daddy '' tom donohue and bobby mitchell from the then infamous kya 1260 am radio station and largely choreographed by jerry marcellino and mel larson who went on to produce many motown artists including michael jackson , diana ross , and some of the top artists of the day . adopting the stage name '' sly stone , '' he then formed '' the stoners '' in 1966 which included cynthia robinson on trumpet . with her he started his next band , sly and the family stone . stone , robinson , and fred stewart were joined by larry graham , greg errico , and jerry martini , all of whom had studied music and worked in numerous amateur groups . working around the bay area in 1967 , this multiracial band made a strong impression . on the first recordings little sister 's vet stone , mary mccreary , and elva mouton did backup vocals . in 1968 sister rosie stone ( piano and vocals ) joined the band . sly and the family stone 's success . along with james brown and parliament-funkadelic , sly and the family stone were pioneers of late 1960s and early '70s funk . their fusion of r & b rhythms , infectious melodies , and psychedelia created a new pop/soul/rock hybrid the impact of which has proven lasting and widespread . motown producer norman whitfield , for example , patterned the label 's forays into harder-driving , socially relevant material ( such as the temptations ' '' runaway child '' and '' ball of confusion '' ) based on their sound . the pioneering precedent of stone 's racial , sexual , and stylistic mix , had a major influence in the 1980s on artists such as prince and rick james . legions of artists from the 1990s forward – including public enemy , fatboy slim , beck , beastie boys and ll cool j 's popular '' mama said knock you out '' along with many others – mined stone 's seminal back catalog for hook-laden samples . '' the most talented musician i know is sly stone , '' bootsy collins said in an interview with mojo .
