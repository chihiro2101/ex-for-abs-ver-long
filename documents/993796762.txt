Maurice Duruflé

life and career . duruflé was born in louviers , eure in 1902 . he became a chorister at the rouen cathedral choir school from 1912 to 1918 , where he studied piano and organ with jules haelling , a pupil of alexandre guilmant . the choral plainsong tradition at rouen became a strong and lasting influence . at age 17 , upon moving to paris , he took private organ lessons with charles tournemire , whom he assisted at basilique ste-clotilde , paris until 1927 . in 1920 duruflé entered the conservatoire de paris , eventually graduating with first prizes in organ with eugène gigout ( 1922 ) , harmony with jean gallon ( 1924 ) , fugue with georges caussade ( 1924 ) , piano accompaniment with césar abel estyle ( 1926 ) and composition with paul dukas ( 1928 ) . in 1927 , louis vierne nominated him as his assistant at notre-dame . duruflé and vierne remained lifelong friends , and duruflé was at vierne 's side acting as assistant when vierne died at the console of the notre-dame organ on 2 june 1937 , even though duruflé had become titular organist of st-étienne-du-mont in paris in 1929 , a position he held for the rest of his life . in 1930 he won a prize for his prélude , adagio et choral varié sur le '' veni creator '' , and in 1936 he won the prix blumenthal . in 1939 , he premiered francis poulenc 's organ concerto ( the concerto for organ , strings and timpani in g minor ) ; he had advised poulenc on the registrations of the organ part . in 1943 he became professor of harmony at the conservatoire de paris , where he worked until 1970 ; among his pupils were pierre cochereau , jean guillou and marie-claire alain . in 1947 he completed probably the most famous of his few pieces : the requiem op . 9 , for soloists , choir , organ , and orchestra . he had begun composing the work in 1941 , following a commission from the vichy france . also in 1947 , marie-madeleine duruflé became his assistant at st-étienne-du-mont . they married on 15 september 1953 . ( duruflé 's first marriage to lucette bousquet , in 1932 , ended in civil divorce in 1947 and was declaration of nullity on 23 june 1953 . ) the couple became a famous and popular organ duo , going on tour together several times throughout the sixties and early seventies . he was made a chevalier de la legion d'honneur in 1954 . he was promoted to an officier de la legion d'honneur in 1966 . perfectionism . duruflé was highly critical of his own compositions . he particularly disparaged the toccata from suite , op . 5 , and never recorded it . he never programmed the toccata , his sicilienne or the prelude or adagio from veni creator . ebrecht ( 2002 , pgs vi and 58 ) he published only a handful of works and often continued to edit and change pieces after publication . for instance , the toccata from suite has a completely different ending in the first edition than in the more recent version , and the score to the fugue sur le nom d'alain originally indicated accelerando throughout . the result of this perfectionism is that his music , especially his organ music , tends to be well polished , and is still frequently performed in concerts by organists around the world . duruflé and his wife were musically conservative . in 1969 they attended a '' jazz mass '' at st-étienne-du-mont . marie-madeleine was visibly upset by the experience , and duruflé called it a scandalous travesty . ebrecht 2002 , pg 48 . . later life and death . duruflé suffered severe injuries in a car accident on 29 may 1975 , and as a result he gave up performing ; indeed he was largely confined to his apartment , leaving the service at st-étienne-du-mont to his wife marie-madeleine ( who was also injured in the accident ) . he died in a clinic at louveciennes ( near paris ) in 1986 , aged 84 , never having fully recovered from the accident . ebrecht ( 2002 , pg 63 ) . compositions . organ solo . scherzo op . 2 ( 1926 ) prélude , adagio et choral varié sur le theme du 'veni creator op . 4 ( 1926/1930 ) suite op . 5 ( 1932 ) : prélude sicilienne ebrecht has restored a recapitulative transition from the manuscript durufle used to perform the premier in 1932 that is not in the published version .
