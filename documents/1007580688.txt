Francis Brett Young

life . francis brett young was born in halesowen , worcestershire . he received his early education at a private school in sutton coldfield . his father was a doctor and his mother also came from a medical family , so it was natural that he go to the school for the sons of doctors , epsom college . he was there when , at fourteen , he suffered the death of his beloved mother . he later went on to train at the university of birmingham to become a qualified physician . he met his wife jessie hankinson while he was lodging at edgbaston in birmingham and she was training at anstey college of physical education , then housed in nearby the leasowes ( the former home of william shenstone , the author he most admired ) . he started medical practice on the steamship ss kintuck , on a long voyage to the far east . he returned with the money to purchase his own medical practice at cleveland house , brixham , devon , in 1907 . established in his first secure job , he was able to be secretly married to jessie hankinson in december 1908 . jessie was also a singer and he accompanied her , as well as composing two sets of songs for her , published in 1912 and 1913 . his first attempt at a novel , undergrowth , was a collaboration with his younger brother , eric . eric subsequently forged a writing career of his own which , while less successful , produced novels such as the murder at fleet and the dancing beggars . during the world war i he saw service in german east africa in the royal army medical corps ( he was a medical officer of the 2nd rhodesia regiment ) , but was invalided out in 1918 , and no longer able to practise medicine . his own account of these wartime events is given in his book marching on tanga ; passages censored from that book were later covertly used in his novel jim redlake . unable to work as a doctor , he decided to devote himself to his writing , and in 1919 he began the first of his mercian novels . from 1920 the couple went to live in capri until 1929 but also travelled widely , including trips to south africa , the united states and summers in the lake district of england . they returned to live in england , initially in the lake district as neighbours of fellow novelist hugh walpole . here they lived in esthwaite lodge , a country house , still standing , south of hawkshead on the west side of esthwaite water . then , from 1932 , they settled at the dilapidated craycombe house , fladbury , worcestershire , which he was able to buy and slowly renovate due to his continuing success as a writer . his income also enabled him to spend the winters in capri , which was vital due to his poor health . this changed as italy became fascist and war approached , and in 1937 he purchased talland house between looe and polperro as an alternative winter retreat . when war came in 1939 , craycombe house was requisitioned by the red cross and turned into a convalescent home for the armed services . in 1944 , near to the war 's end , he published his epic poem the island , recounting in verse the whole history of britain from the bronze age to the battle of britain . the entire first edition of 23,500 sold out immediately , even in wartime conditions , and was then reprinted . the winters and wartime privations in england had taken their toll on his poor health . in october 1944 , having seen the island through to publication , he had a serious heart attack . at the end of the second world war he moved to montagu in the klein karoo , south africa . the climate suited him , and he was even able to complete the writing of a non-fiction guide book for the south african tourist board . he died in cape town on 28 march 1954 . he was cremated and his ashes were returned to england , and are buried in worcester cathedral . british medical journal 4 april 1954 . work . like many authors he uses the places and occupations he knew as the backdrops for his work . there is much description of the sea , war and medical practice set in places as far apart as the west midlands and west country of england and south africa . his first published novel deep sea ( 1914 ) has brixham as a background while portrait of clare ( 1927 ) is set in the west midlands , as are several of his works from this period . the iron age ( 1916 ) is set partly in ludlow , shropshire . mercian novels . the central project of francis brett young 's career was a series of linked novels set in a loosely fictionalised version of the english west midlands and welsh marches . the mercian novels were originally inspired by the construction of birmingham corporation 's elan valley reservoirs from 1893–1904 , and the country traversed by their associated aqueduct . the black diamond ; preface - francis brett young ; collins , 1921 the black diamond ( 1921 ) tells the story of a labourer working on the aqueduct in the region around knighton , while the house under the water ( 1932 ) deals at length with the construction of the reservoirs themselves . the series expanded into a wide-ranging study of midlands society from the 1890s through to the outbreak of the second world war . although linked by recurring characters , each of the mercian novels can be read as an independent work . they range in style from the atmospheric psychological horror of cold harbour ( 1924 ; praised by h . p . lovecraft ) the annotated supernatural horror in literature ; chapter ix—h . p . lovecraft , ed . s . t . joshi ; hippocampus press , 2000 ; to the romantic family saga of portrait of clare ( 1927 ) , which won that year 's james tait black memorial prize . like thomas hardy 's wessex novels , the mercian novels are unified by their setting—a semi-fictionalised realisation of an actual geographical region . while some actual place-names appear unchanged ( e.g . , kidderminster , ludlow , malvern , shrewsbury , worcester ) , most locations appear under a fictional name ( birmingham north bromwich , halesowen halesby ; dudley dulston ; river elan river garon ) . other locations appear to be fictional conflations of various real-world places ; e.g . , the black country town of wednesford ; resembling in many respects the actual town of wednesbury but located by the author in the stour valley ( and seemingly unrelated to hednesford , near cannock ) , and the hamlet of cold harbour ; modelled on wassell grove near hagley cold harbour - francis brett young , house of stratus , 2003 ; but described by him as overlooking the black country . main works . undergrowth ( with eric brett young ) ( 1913 ) deep sea ( 1914 ) the iron age ( 1916 ) marching on tanga ( with general smuts in east africa ) ( 1917 ) , war memoir the crescent moon ( 1918 ) the young physician ( 1919 ) poems , 1916-1918 ( 1919 ) the tragic bride ( 1920 ) the black diamond ( 1921 ) the red knight ( 1921 ) collins , london pilgrim 's rest ( 1922 ) cold harbour ( 1924 ) woodsmoke ( 1924 ) sea horses ( 1925 ) portrait of clare ( 1927 ) the key of life ( 1928 ) my brother jonathan ( 1928 ) black roses ( 1929 ) jim redlake ( 1930 ) mr . and mrs . pennington ( 1931 ) the house under the water ( 1932 ) this little world ( 1934 ) white ladies ( 1935 ) far forest ( 1936 ) portrait of a village ( 1937 ) they seek a country ( 1937 ) dr . bradley remembers ( 1938 ) the city of gold ( 1939 ) mr . lucton 's freedom ( 1940 ) a man about the house ( 1942 ) , play and film both 1947 the island ( 1944 ) ( written in epic verse ) in south africa ( 1952 ) wistanslow ( 1956 - published posthumously ) . archives . archives of francis brett young are held at the cadbury research library , university of birmingham . the archive collection includes a large number of letters , many of which are from prominent figures of the twentieth century . . film and television adaptations . several of his books were adapted for film and television , including my brother jonathan ( 1948 ) starring michael denison , dulcie gray and james robertson justice ;
