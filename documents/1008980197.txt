Ferris wheel

early history . astrowheel was part of the original lineup of rides when astroworld opened in 1968 ; it was removed in 1981 to make way for the warp 10 ride . astrowheel had an eight-spoked spider at the end of each arm , and each tip had a separate car for eight cars in total on each end . in contrast , galaxy had double the capacity with a four-spoked spider at the end of each arm ; each tip bore an independent four-spoked sub-spider for sixteen cars in total on each end . like astrowheel , galaxy was part of the lineup at magic mountain when the park opened in 1971 , and was removed in 1980 when six flags took over ownership of both parks . file : giant wheel.jpg giant wheel , a waagner-biro/intamin double wheel file : scorpion ( abandoned ) ( 23706758666 ) . jpg abandoned scorpion at parque de la ciudad ( 2015 ) file : sky whirl 2.jpg sky whirl , a triple wheel at gurnee swiss broker intamin marketed a similar series of double wheels manufactured by waagner-biro , comprising a vertical column supporting a straight cantilever arm , with each end of the cantilever arm ending in a spoked ferris wheel . the first intamin produced was giant wheel at hersheypark in hershey , pennsylvania , which operated from 1973 to 2004 . other double wheels made by waagner-biro/intamin include zodiac ( kings island , mason , ohio ; 1975–86 ; moved to wonderland sydney and operated 1989–2004 ) , scorpion ( parque de la ciudad , buenos aires , argentina ; 1982–2003 ) , and double wheel ( kuwait entertainment city , kuwait city , kuwait ; 1984–91 ) . a triple variant was custom designed for the marriott corporation and debuted at both marriott 's great america parks ( now six flags great america , gurnee , illinois , and california 's great america , santa clara ) in 1976 as sky whirl . each ride had three main components : the three spiders/wheels with their passenger cars ; the triple-spoked supporting arm ; and the single central supporting column . each wheel rotated about one of the three ends of the supporting arm . the supporting arm would in turn rotate around its central hub as a single unit about the top of the supporting column . the axis about which the supporting arm turned was offset from vertical ( i.e . , the plane of rotation was not horizontal ) , so that as the supporting arm rotated , each wheel was raised and lowered . when lowered , one wheel was horizontal at ground level . at the same time , the other wheels remained raised and continued to rotate in a near-vertical plane at considerable height . the lowered horizontal wheel was brought to a standstill for simultaneous loading and unloading of all its passenger cars . the sky whirl was also known as a triple ferris wheel , triple giant wheel , or triple tree wheel ; it was in height . the sky whirl in santa clara was filmed for a memorable rescue scene in beverly hills cop iii ( renamed to '' the spider '' for the film ) . the santa clara ride , renamed triple wheel in post-marriott years , closed on 1 september 1997 . the gurnee ride closed in 2000 . two triple wheels were built for asian clients : tree triple wheel at seibu-en ( tokorozawa , saitama , japan ; 1985–2004 ) and hydra at lotte world ( seoul , south korea ; 1989–97 ) . . eccentric wheels . an eccentric wheel ( sometimes called a sliding wheel or coaster wheel ) differs from a conventional ferris wheel in that some or all of its passenger cars are not fixed directly to the rim of the wheel , but instead slide on rails between the rim and the hub as the wheel rotates . the two most famous eccentric wheels are wonder wheel , at deno 's wonder wheel amusement park , coney island , us , and pixar pal-a-round ( previously sun wheel and mickey 's fun wheel ) , at disney california adventure , us . the latter is a replica of the former . there is a second replica in yokohama dreamland , japan . pixar pal-a-round is tall and has 24 fully enclosed passenger cars , each able to carry six passengers . each passenger car is decorated with the face of a pixar character . sixteen slide inward and outward as the wheel rotates , the remainder are fixed to the rim . there are separate boarding queues for sliding and fixed cars , so that passengers may choose between the two . inspired by coney island 's 1920 wonder wheel , it was designed by walt disney imagineering and waagner biro , completed in 2001 as the sun wheel , later refurbished and reopened in 2009 as mickey 's fun wheel , and again rethemed as pixar pal-a-round in 2018 . wonder wheel was built in 1920 , is tall , and can carry 144 people . the wonder wheel file : ferris.jpg hermann eccentric ferris wheel with sliding cars , from us patent 1354436 , 1915 ;
