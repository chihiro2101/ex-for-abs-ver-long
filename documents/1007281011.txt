Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson

childhood and education . bjørnson was born at the farmstead of bjørgan in kvikne , a secluded village in the østerdalen district , some sixty miles south of trondheim . in 1837 bjørnson 's father peder bjørnson , who was the pastor of kvikne , was transferred to the parish of nesset , outside molde in romsdal . it was in this scenic district that bjørnson spent his childhood , living at the nesset parsonage . after a few years studying in the neighbouring city molde , bjørnson was sent at the age of 17 to heltberg latin school ( heltbergs studentfabrikk ) in oslo to prepare for university . this was the same school that trained ibsen , lie , and vinje . bjørnson had realized that he wanted to pursue his talent for poetry ( he had written verses since age eleven ) . he matriculated at the university of oslo in 1852 , soon embarking upon a career as a journalist , focusing on criticism of drama . . early production . in 1857 bjørnson published synnøve solbakken , the first of his peasant novels . in 1858 this was followed by arne , in 1860 by en glad gut ( a happy boy ) , and in 1868 by fiskerjentene ( the fisher girls ) . these are the most important specimens of his bonde-fortellinger or peasant tales . . a biographical essay , 1910 , by william morton payne , a translator of various works by bjørnson . at least seven danish composers wrote music based on arne : morten eskesen , c . j . frydensberg , peter heise , anton nielsen , oluf ring , henrik rung , and sigrid henriette wienecke . bjørnson was anxious '' to create a new saga in the light of the peasant , '' as he put it , and he thought this should be done , not merely in prose fiction , but in national dramas or folke-stykker . the earliest of these was a one-act piece set in the 12th century , mellem slagene ( between the battles ) , written in 1855 and produced in 1857 . he was especially influenced at this time by the study of jens immanuel baggesen and adam gottlob oehlenschläger , during a visit to copenhagen . mellem slagene was followed by halte-hulda ( lame hulda ) in 1858 , and kong sverre ( king sverre ) in 1861 . his most important work to date was the poetic trilogy of sigurd slembe ( sigurd the bad ) , which bjørnson published in 1862 . . the mature author . at the close of 1857 bjørnson had been appointed director of the theatre at bergen , a post which he held for two years , when he returned to oslo . from 1860 to 1863 he travelled widely throughout europe . early in 1865 he undertook the management of the christiania theatre , and brought out his popular comedy of de nygifte ( the newly married ) and his romantic tragedy of mary stuart in scotland . in 1870 he published poems and songs and the epic cycle arnljot gelline ; the latter volume contains the ode bergliot , one of bjørnson 's finest contributions to lyrical poetry . between 1864 and 1874 , bjørnson displayed a slackening of the intellectual forces very remarkable in a man of his energy ; he was mainly occupied with politics and with his business as a theatrical manager . this was the period of bjørnson 's most fiery propaganda as a radical agitator . in 1871 he began to supplement his journalistic work by delivering lectures throughout scandinavia . from 1874 to 1876 bjørnson was absent from norway , and in the peace of voluntary exile he recovered his imaginative powers . his new departure as a dramatic author began with en fallit ( a bankruptcy ) and redaktøren ( the editor ) in 1874 , social dramas of an extremely modern and realistic cast . the '' national poet '' . bjørnson settled on his estate of aulestad in gausdal . in 1877 he published another novel , magnhild , in which his ideas on social questions were seen to be in a state of fermentation , and gave expression to his republican sentiments in the polemical play kongen ( the king ) . in a later edition of the play , he prefixed an essay on '' intellectual freedom '' in further explanation of his position . kaptejn mansana ( captain mansana ) , an episode of the italian unification , was written in to 1878 . extremely anxious to obtain full success on the stage , bjørnson concentrated his powers on a drama of social life , leonarda ( 1879 ) , which raised a violent controversy . a satirical play , det nye system ( the new system ) , was produced a few weeks later . although these plays of bjørnson 's second period were greatly discussed , few were financially successful . bjørnson produced a social drama , en handske ( a gauntlet ) , in 1883 , but was unable to persuade any manager to stage it except in a modified form . in the autumn of the same year , bjørnson published a mystical or symbolic drama over ævne ( beyond powers ) , dealing with the abnormal features of religious excitement with extraordinary force ; this was not acted until 1899 , when it achieved a great success . political interests . from his youth and forwards , bjørnson admired henrik wergeland , and became a vivid spokesman for the norwegian left-wing movement . in this respect , he supported ivar aasen , and joined forces in the political struggles in the 1860s and 1870s . when the great monument over henrik wergeland were to be erected in 1881 , it came to political struggle between left and right , and the left-wing got the upper hand . bjørnson presented the speech on behalf of wergeland , and also honouring the constitution and the farmers . bjørnson 's political opinions had brought upon him a charge of high treason , and he took refuge for a time in germany , returning to norway in 1882 . convinced that the theatre was practically closed to him , he turned back to the novel , and published in 1884 det flager i byen og paa havnen ( flags are flying in town and port ) , embodying his theories on heredity and education . in 1889 he printed another long and still more remarkable novel , paa guds veje ( on god 's path ) , which is chiefly concerned with the same problems . the same year saw the publication of a comedy , geografi og kærlighed ( geography and love ) , which met with success . a number of short stories , of a more or less didactic character , dealing with startling points of emotional experience , were collected and published 1894 . later plays were a political tragedy called paul lange og tora parsberg ( 1898 ) , a second part of over ævne ( beyond powers ii ) ( 1895 ) , laboremus ( 1901 ) , på storhove ( at storhove ) ( 1902 ) , and daglannet ( dag 's farm ) ( 1904 ) . in 1899 , at the opening of the national theatre , bjørnson received an ovation , and his saga-drama of king sigurd i of norway was performed at the opening of nationaltheatret in oslo . a subject which interested him greatly was the question of the nynorsk , the adopting of a national language for norway distinct from the dansk-norsk ( dano-norwegian ) , in which most norwegian literature had hitherto been written . at an early stage , before 1860 , bjørnson had himself experimented with at least one short story written in nynorsk . the interest , however , did not last , and he soon abandoned this enterprise altogether . afterwards , he regretted that he never felt he gained the mastery of this language . bjørnson 's strong and sometimes rather narrow patriotism did not blind him to what he considered the fatal folly of such a proposal , and his lectures and pamphlets against the målstræv in its extreme form were very effective . his attitude towards this must have changed sometime after 1881 , as he still spoke on behalf of the farmers at this point . although he seems to have been supportive of ivar aasen and friendly towards farmers ( in the peasant-novels ) , he later denounced this , and stated in 1899 that there was limits to a farmer 's cultivation . i can draw a line on the wall . the farmer can cultivate himself to this level , and no more , he wrote in 1899 . rumour has it that he had been insulted by a farmer at some point , and uttered the statement in sheer anger . in 1881 , he spoke of the farmer 's clothing borne by henrik wergeland , and his opinion then states that this garment , worn by wergeland , was '' of the most influential things '' in the initiation of the national day . bjørnson 's attitude towards the farmers remain ambiguous . his father himself was a farmer 's son . during the last twenty years of his life he wrote hundreds of articles in major european papers . he attacked the french justice in the dreyfus affair , and he fought for the rights of children in slovakia to learn their own mother tongue . '' to detach children from their mother tongue is identical to tearing them away from their mothers breasts , '' he wrote . bjørnson wrote in multiple newspapers about the černová massacre under the title the greatest industry of hungary – which was supposedly 'magyarization ' . last years . bjørnson was , from the beginning of the dreyfus affair , a staunch supporter of alfred dreyfus , and , according to a contemporary , wrote '' article after article in the papers and proclaimed in every manner his belief in his innocence '' . bjørnson was one of the original members of the norwegian nobel committee , that awards the nobel peace prize , where he sat from 1901 to 1906 . in 1903 he was awarded the nobel prize in literature . bjørnson had done as much as any other man to rouse norwegian nationalistic feeling , but in 1903 , on the verge of the rupture between norway and sweden , he preached conciliation and moderation to the norwegians . however , in 1905 he largely remained silent . when norway was attempting to dissolve the forced union with sweden , bjørnson sent a telegram to the norwegian prime minister stating , '' now is the time to unite . '' the minister replied , '' now is the time to shut up . '' this was in fact a satirical illustration published in vikingen , but the story got so popular and widespread that bjørnson had to deny it , claiming that '' michelsen has never asked me to shut up ; it would not help if he did '' .
