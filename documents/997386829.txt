works . adaptation of the english medieval mystery plays , based on the york and wakefield cycles , the mysteries , were first performed in 1985 by the royal national theatre . interviewed by melvyn bragg for bbc television in 2012 , harrison said : '' it was only when i did the mystery plays and got northern actors doing verse , that i felt that i was reclaiming the energy of classical verse in the voices that it was created for . '' '' melvyn bragg on class and culture : episode 2 , bbc2 , broadcast 2 march 2012 one of his best-known works is the long poem '' v '' ( 1985 ) , written during the miners ' strike of 1984–85 , and describing a trip to see his parents ' grave in holbeck cemetery in beeston , leeds , 'now littered with beer cans and vandalised by obscene graffiti ' . the title has several possible interpretations : victory , versus , verse , etc . proposals to screen a filmed version of ' v . ' by channel 4 in october 1987 drew howls of outrage from the tabloid press , some broadsheet journalists , and mps , apparently concerned about the effects its '' torrents of obscene language '' and '' streams of four-letter filth '' would have on the nation 's youth . indeed , an early day motion entitled '' television obscenity '' was proposed on 27 october 1987 by a group of conservative mps , who condemned channel 4 and the independent broadcasting authority . the motion was opposed only by mp norman buchan , who suggested that fellow members had either failed to read or failed to understand the poem . the broadcast went ahead and , after widespread press coverage , the uproar subsided . gerald howarth mp said that harrison was '' probably another bolshie poet wishing to impose his frustrations on the rest of us '' . when told of this , harrison retorted that howarth was '' probably another idiot mp wishing to impose his intellectual limitations on the rest of us '' . . reception . richard eyre calls harrison 's 1990 play , the trackers of oxyrhynchus '' among the five most imaginative pieces of drama in the 90s '' . jocelyn herbert , famous designer of the british theatrical scene , comments that harrison is aware of the dramatic visual impact of his ideas : '' the idea of satyrs jumping out of boxes in trackers is wonderful for the stage . some writers just write and have little idea what it will look like , but tony always knows exactly what he wants . '' edith hall has written that she is convinced that harrison 's 1998 film-poem prometheus is '' artistic reaction to the fall of the british working class '' at the end of the twentieth century , and considers it as '' the most important adaptation of classical myth for a radical political purpose for years '' and harrison 's '' most brilliant artwork , with the possible exception of his stage play the trackers of oxyrhynchus '' . professor roger griffin of the department of history at oxford brookes university , in his paper the palingenetic political community : rethinking the legitimation of totalitarian regimes in inter-war europe , describes harrison 's film-poem as '' magnificent '' and suggests that harrison is trying to tell his audience '' to avoid falling prey to the collective mirage of a new order , to stay wide awake while others succumb to the lethe of the group mind , to resist the gaze of modern gorgons '' . . bibliography . poetry . the loiners ( 1970 ) from the school of eloquence and other poems ( 1978 ) continuous ( 50 sonnets from the school of eloquence and other poems ) ( 1981 ) a kumquat for john keats ( 1981 ) v ( 1985 ) dramatic verse,1973–85 ( 1985 ) the gaze of the gorgon ( 1992 ) black daisies for the bride ( 1993 ) the shadow of hiroshima and other film/poems ( 1995 ) laureate 's block and other occasional poems ( 2000 ) under the clock ( 2005 ) selected poems ( 2006 ) collected poems ( 2007 ) collected film poetry ( 2007 ) kumkwat dla johna keatsa , in polish , bohdan zadura ( trans . ) , warszawa : piw ( 1990 ) sztuka i zagłada , in polish , bohdan zadura ( trans . ) , legnica : biuro literackie ( 1999 ) . pamphlets . earthworks ( 1964 ) newcastle is peru ( 1969 ) bow down ( 1977 ) looking up ( 1979 ) the fire gap ( 1985 ) anno forty two : seven new poems ( 1987 ) ten sonnets from '' the school of eloquence '' ( 1987 ) a cold coming ( 1991 ) a maybe day in kazakhstan ( 1994 ) . film and television . the blue bird : lyrics for george cukor film ( 1976 ) arctic paradise : verse commentary for film in series the world about us , producer : andree molyneux for bbc two ( 1981 ) the oresteia : translation for national theatre production with music by harrison birtwistle , filmed for channel four television .
