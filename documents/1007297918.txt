'' ) this statement by jesus in the gospel of by which jesus explained to the apostles the significance of his action of washing their feet . the phrase is used as the antiphon sung in the roman rite during the maundy ( ecclesiastical latin : '' mandatum '' ) ceremony of the washing of the feet , which may be held during mass or as a separate event , during which a priest or bishop ( representing christ ) ceremonially washes the feet of others , typically 12 persons chosen as a cross-section of the community . in 2016 , it was announced that the roman missal had been revised to allow women to participate as part of the 12 in the mandatum ; previously , only males partook of the rite . others theorize that the english name '' maundy thursday '' arose from '' maundsor baskets '' or '' maundy purses '' of alms which the king of england distributed to certain poor at whitehall before attending mass on that day . thus , '' maund '' is connected to the latin mendicare , and french mendier , to beg . a source from the shepherd of the springs , lutheran church likewise states that , if the name was derived from the latin mandatum , we would call the day mandy thursday , or mandate thursday , or even mandatum thursday ; and that the term '' maundy '' comes in fact from the latin mendicare , old french mendier , and english maund , which as a verb means to beg and as a noun refers to a small basket held out by maunders as they maunded . other sources reject this etymology . . services . western christianity . . services . with maundy thursday commemorating the last supper , christian denominations who observe this day universally celebrate the sacrament of holy communion , which they teach was instituted by jesus on this night . the maundy ( washing of the feet ) is practiced among many christian groups on maundy thursday , including the anglican/protestant episcopal , armenian , ethiopian , lutheran , methodist , eastern catholic , schwarzenau brethren , church of the brethren , mennonite , presbyterian and roman catholic traditions . in the catholic church and in some anglican churches , the mass of the lord 's supper begins as usual , but the gloria is accompanied by the ringing of church bells , which are then silent until the easter vigil . after the homily the washing of feet may be performed . the blessed sacrament remains exposed , at least in the catholic mass , until the service concludes with a procession taking it to the altar of repose . the altar is later stripped bare , as are all other altars in the church except the altar of repose . in pre-1970 editions , the roman missal envisages this being done ceremonially , to the accompaniment of , a practice which continues in anglican churches of anglo-catholic churchmanship . in other christian denominations , such as the lutheran church or methodist church , the stripping of the altar and other items on the chancel also occurs , as a preparation for the somber good friday service . . chrism mass . the chrism mass is a religious service held in roman catholicism , lutheranism and anglicanism . maundy thursday is notable for being the day on which the chrism mass is celebrated in each diocese . the chrism mass is one of the most solemn and important liturgies of the liturgical year . usually held in the diocesan cathedral , it is generally held on the morning of maundy thursday , but may in some dioceses take place on another day during holy week . saunders , william . '' what is the chrism mass ? '' , arlington catholic herald , march 23 , 2017 it is often the largest annual gathering of clergy and faithful held in most dioceses . the mass is a celebration of the institution of the priesthood . during the mass , those present are called to renew their baptismal promises ; priests/ministers and deacons also reaffirm their ministry by renewing the promises made at their ordination . the mass takes its name from the blessing of the chrism used in the sacraments throughout the year , which are then given to priests to take back to their parishes . the rite of reception of the oils by representatives of the diocesan parishes is a sign of each parish 's unity with the bishop and the diocesan church . the service is a 1967 restoration of the rite recorded in the early 200s by the historian hippolytus who writes of a ceremony taking place during the easter vigil at which two holy oils were blessed and one was consecrated . in the fifth century , the ceremony of the oils was transferred from the holy saturday vigil to holy thursday during a special mass for that purpose , distinct from the mass of the lord 's supper . in the decree renewing this rite pope paul vi said , '' the chrism mass is one of the principal expressions of the fullness of the bishop ’ s priesthood and signifies the closeness of the priests with him . '' the holy oils are : chrism – used in the sacraments of baptism , confirmation and holy orders , as well as for the consecration of altars and the dedication of churches . the oil of catechumens – also used in the sacrament of baptism , and the oil of the sick – used in the rite of the anointing of the sick the oil of the catechumens and chrism are used on the upcoming holy saturday at the easter vigil , for the baptism and confirmation of those entering the church . while the oil of the catechumens and the oil of the sick , are simply '' blessed , '' the sacred chrism is '' consecrated , '' . holy chrism is a mixture of olive oil and balsam , an aromatic resin . balsam is poured into the oil , which gives it a sweet smell intended to remind those who encounter it of the '' odor of sanctity '' to which those who are marked with it , are called to strive . the bishop breathes over the vessel containing the chrism , a gesture which symbolizes the holy spirit coming down to consecrate this oil , and recalls the actions of jesus in john 20:22 , when he breathed on the apostles and said , '' receive the holy spirit . '' with respect to anglicanism , the 1979 book of common prayer ( p . & nbsp ; 307 ) calls for chrism to be consecrated by the bishop . in many dioceses , the consecration of chrism by the bishop may be done at a service of reaffirmation of ordination vows during holy week . during the chrism eucharist , the bishop will bless the oils used throughout the next year for baptisms and healing . in addition , the bishop and clergy in attendance will reaffirm their ordination vows . . eastern christianity . . eastern orthodoxy . in the eastern orthodox church , the liturgical colours are brighter , white being common . on this day alone during holy week , the fast is relaxed to permit consumption of wine and oil . the primary service of this day is vespers combined with the liturgy of st . basil at which is read the first passion gospel , known as the '' gospel of the testament '' , and many of the normal hymns of the divine liturgy are substituted with the following troparion : of thy mystical supper , o son of god , accept me today as a communicant ;
