the proceedings resumed in january 1905 when his condition improved . william low died from a seizure in june 1905 , before the divorce was finalized . after the funeral , it was revealed that he had left almost everything to bateman , and that he had revoked his 1903 support deal with juliette . william low 's sisters contested the will , with the support of juliette low . she ultimately received a sum of money , the low house in savannah with its surrounding land , and stocks and securities . girl guides . after the death of her husband , juliette travelled , took sculpting classes , and did charity work while looking for a project that she could focus her time and skills on . in may 1911 , she met sir robert baden-powell at a party , and was inspired by the boy scouts , a program that he had organized . at the time , the boy scouts had 40,000 members throughout europe and the united states . it stressed the importance of military preparedness and having fun , two values that she appreciated . juliette low and baden-powell became close friends and spent a large amount of time together over the next year . in august 1911 , juliette became involved with the girl guides , an offshoot of the boy scouts for girls that was headed by agnes baden-powell , sir robert baden powell 's sister . she formed a girl guides patrol near her home in scotland , where she encouraged the girls to become self-sufficient by learning how to spin wool and care for livestock . she also taught them knot tying , how to read a map , knitting , cooking , and first aid , and her friends in the military taught the girls drilling , signalling , and camping . she organized two new girl guides patrols in london when she visited for the winter of 1911 . start of the american girl guides . in 1912 , juliette low and baden-powell took a trip to the united states to spread the scouting movement . she hoped to spread the movement to her hometown , savannah , as a way to help girls learn practical skills and build character . when she arrived , she made a phone call to her cousin nina pape , a local educator , saying , '' i 've got something for the girls of savannah , and all america , and all the world , and we 're going to start it tonight . '' shortly after , in march 1912 , juliette low formed the first two american girl guides patrols , registering 18 girls . the early growth of the girl guides movement in the united states was due to juliette 's extensive social connections , and she contributed early on by recruiting new members and leaders . she advertised in newspapers and magazines and recruited her family and friends . baden-powell also put her in contact with people interested in girl guiding , including louise carnegie . after forming the first american troops , she described herself as '' deep in girl guides , '' and by the next year , she had released the first american girl guides manual , titled how girls can help their country , which was based on scouting for boys by robert baden-powell and how girls can help to build up the empire by agnes baden-powell . juliette low established the first headquarters in a remodelled carriage house , behind the home in savannah that she inherited from her husband . the headquarters contained meeting rooms for the local girl guide patrols , and the lot outside was used for marching and signalling drills and sports , including basketball . edmund strudwick nash , who rented the main house from juliette low , offered to pay rent on the carriage house as his contribution to the organization , becoming one of the american girl guide 's first benefactors . nash 's son , ogden nash , immortalized '' mrs low 's house '' in one of his poems . juliette low travelled along the east coast , spreading girl guiding to other communities , before returning to savannah to speak with president taft , who was making a visit to the gordon home . she hoped to convince taft that his daughter helen should become a patron for the girl guides , but she was unsuccessful . american girl scouts . many competing organizations for girls that claimed to be the closest model to boy scouting were forming , and juliette low believed that gaining support from prominent people would help legitimize her organization as the official sister organization to the boy scouts . her biggest competition was the camp fire girls , which was formed in part by james e . west , the chief executive of the boy scouts of america , and a strong proponent of strict gender roles . in march 1912 , juliette low wrote to the camp fire girls , inviting them to merge into the girl guides , but they declined even after baden-powell suggested that they reconsider . west considered many of the activities that the girl guides participated in to be gender-inappropriate , and he was concerned that the public would question the masculinity of the boy scouts if they participated in similar activities . renaming the organization . although the girl guides were growing , the camp fire girls were growing at a faster rate , so juliette low traveled to england to seek counsel from the british girl guides . by the time she returned to america in 1913 , she had a plan to spread girl guiding nationwide by changing the name from girl guides to girl scouts , establishing a national headquarters , and recruiting patrons outside of georgia . upon returning to savannah , she learned that the savannah girl guides had already renamed themselves to girl scouts because '' scout '' reminded them of america 's pioneer ancestry . west objected to the name change , saying that it trivialized the name of scout and would cause older boy scouts to quit . baden-powell gave juliette low his support on her use of the term scout , although he preferred the term guide for the british girl guides . in 1913 , juliette low set up the girl scouts national headquarters in washington , d.c . , and hired her friend edith johnston to be the national executive secretary . the national headquarters served as the '' central information dispenser '' for girl scouting , as well as the place where girls could purchase their badges and the newly published handbook , how girls can help their country . juliette recruited leaders and members in various states and spoke with every group that she could . around the same time , she designed and patented the trefoil badge , although west claimed that the trefoil belonged to the boy scouts and the girl scouts had no right to use it . she traveled back to london in the summer , where she met king george v and queen mary of teck , and received the girl guide thanks badge from princess louise for promoting guiding . juliette low also formed the honorary committee of girl scouts and elected her family and friends to the committee . by using her connections , she was able to convince susan ludlow parish , eleanor roosevelt 's godmother ; mina miller edison , the wife of thomas edison ; and bertha woodward , the wife of the house of representatives majority leader , to become patrons . although she had received many patrons ' support , juliette still funded most girl scout expenses herself . world war i . at the start of world war i , juliette low rented castle menzies in scotland , and let a family of belgian refugees temporarily move in . on february 13 , 1915 , she sailed back to the united states on the . when she

newspapers , magazines , events , and film . in 1916 , juliette relocated the girl scout headquarters from washington dc to new york city . the same year , juliette returned to england to fundraise for and open a home for relatives of wounded soldiers , where she volunteered 3 nights a week . by november , she was back in the united states continuing her work with the girl scouts . in response to the thrift program , a program enacted by the united states food administration with the goal of teaching women how to conserve food , girl scouts in washington , dc began growing and harvesting their own food and canning perishable goods . herbert hoover wrote to juliette low , thanking her for the contributions of the girl scouts and expressing hope that other girl scouts in the country would follow suit . she responded by organizing girl scouts to help the red cross by making surgical dressings and knitting clothing for soldiers . they also picked oakum , swept workrooms , created scrapbooks for wounded soldiers , and made smokeless trench candles for soldiers to heat their food with . by the end of 1917 , juliette low convinced lou henry hoover to become the national vice president of the girl scouts , and edith bolling galt wilson , president woodrow wilson 's second wife , to become the honorary president of the girl scouts . expanding internationally . after world war i ended , interest in the girl guides began to increase in many different countries . in response , olave baden-powell , the chief guide , created the international council of girl guides and girl scouts as a way to bring together the different communities of guides and scouts across the world . the first meeting took place at the girl guide headquarters in london , and gordon low attended as the representative for the united states . juliette low stepped down as the national president of the girl scouts in 1920 so that she could devote more of her time to promoting guiding and scouting on an international scale . she attended as many meetings of the international council as she was able , and would underwrite the travel of foreign delegates so that they would also be able to attend . she also assisted olave baden-powell with converting 65 acres of land into a campsite for the girl guides . juliette furnished a bungalow near the main house on the land and named it '' the link '' .

on and appeared in the golden eaglet , the first girl scout movie . at a fundraising campaign in new york during girl scout week , juliette dropped pamphlets onto a crowd of people from an airplane .

bed-ridden until february 1924 . when she recovered , she resumed her work with the american girl scouts and the international council . she secretly had two more operations to try to cure her breast cancer , but was informed in 1925 that she had about six months to live . she continued to do work for the girl scouts , and even sneaked away during her recovery from surgery to make a speech at the girl scouts ' regional conference in richmond . juliette traveled to liverpool , where dr . william blair-bell was developing a treatment for cancer . she tried his treatment , an iv containing a solution of colloidal lead . the treatment was unsuccessful , and she spent her 66th birthday fighting off lead poisoning . she traveled back to the united states to meet with her doctor , who informed her that she did not have much longer to live . she went to the low home in savannah , where she spent her last few months . juliette low died in savannah on january 17 , 1927 , at the age of
