Wireless

history . photophone . the first wireless telephone conversation occurred in 1880 , when alexander graham bell and charles sumner tainter invented the photophone , a telephone that sent audio over a beam of light . the photophone required sunlight to operate , and a clear line of sight between transmitter and receiver . these factors greatly decreased the viability of the photophone in any practical use . it would be several decades before the photophone 's principles found their first practical applications in military communications and later in fiber-optic communications . . electric wireless technology . . early wireless . a number of wireless electrical signaling schemes including sending electric currents through water and the ground using electrostatic and electromagnetic induction were investigated for telegraphy in the late 19th century before practical radio systems became available . these included a patented induction system by thomas edison allowing a telegraph on a running train to connect with telegraph wires running parallel to the tracks , a william preece induction telegraph system for sending messages across bodies of water , and several operational and proposed telegraphy and voice earth conduction systems . the edison system was used by stranded trains during the great blizzard of 1888 and earth conductive systems found limited use between trenches during world war i but these systems were never successful economically . radio waves . in 1894 , guglielmo marconi began developing a wireless telegraph system using radio waves , which had been known about since proof of their existence in 1888 by heinrich hertz , but discounted as a communication format since they seemed , at the time , to be a short range phenomenon . marconi soon developed a system that was transmitting signals way beyond distances anyone could have predicted ( due in part to the signals bouncing off the then unknown ionosphere ) . marconi and karl ferdinand braun were awarded the 1909 nobel prize for physics for their contribution to this form of wireless telegraphy . millimetre wave communication was first investigated by jagadish chandra bose during 18941896 , when he reached an extremely high frequency of up to 60ghz in his experiments . he also introduced the use of semiconductor junctions to detect radio waves , reprinted in igor grigorov , ed . , antentop , vol . 2 , no.3 , pp . 87–96 . when he patented the radio crystal detector in 1901 . . wireless revolution . file : d2pak.jpg thumb power mosfets , which are used in rf power amplifiers to boost radio frequency ( rf ) signals in long-distance wireless networks . the wireless revolution began in the 1990s , with the advent of digital wireless networks leading to a social revolution , and a paradigm shift from wired to wireless technology , including the proliferation of commercial wireless technologies such as cell phones , mobile telephony , pagers , wireless computer networks , cellular networks , the wireless internet , and laptop and handheld computers with wireless connections . the wireless revolution has been driven by advances in radio frequency ( rf ) and microwave engineering , including the transition from analog to digital rf technology along with the migration to metal–oxide–semiconductor ( mos ) based multi-carrier rf power amplifiers , which enabled a substantial increase in voice traffic along with the delivery of digital data such as text messaging , images and streaming media . . modes . wireless communications can be via : . radio . radio and microwave communication carry information by modulation properties of electromagnetic waves transmitted through space . free-space optical . or dielectric '' light pipes '' . the technology is useful where physical connections are impractical due to high costs or other considerations . for example , free space optical links are used in cities between office buildings which are not wired for networking , where the cost of running cable through the building and under the street would be prohibitive . another widely used example is consumer ir devices such as remote controls and irda ( infrared data association ) networking , which is used as an alternative to wifi networking to allow laptops , pdas , printers , and digital cameras to exchange data . sonic . sonic , especially ultrasound short range communication involves the transmission and reception of sound . electromagnetic induction . electromagnetic induction only allows short-range communication and power transmission . it has been used in biomedical situations such as pacemakers , as well as for short-range rfid tags . services . common examples of wireless equipment include : tech target – definition

pagers : provide connectivity for portable and mobile applications , both personal and business . global positioning system ( gps ) : allows drivers of cars and trucks , captains of boats and ships , and pilots of aircraft to ascertain their location anywhere on earth . cordless computer peripherals : the cordless mouse is a common example ; wireless headphones , keyboards , and printers can also be linked to a computer via wireless using technology such as wireless usb or bluetooth . cordless telephone sets : these are limited-range devices , not to be confused with cell phones . satellite television : is broadcast from satellites in geostationary orbit . typical services use direct broadcast satellite to provide multiple television channels to viewers . electromagnetic spectrum . am and fm radios and other electronic devices make use of the electromagnetic spectrum . the frequencies of the radio spectrum that are available for use for communication are treated as a public resource and are regulated by organizations such as the american federal communications commission , ofcom in the united kingdom , the international itu-r or the european etsi . their regulations determine which frequency ranges can be used for what purpose and by whom . in the absence of such control or alternative arrangements such as a privatized electromagnetic spectrum , chaos might result if , for example , airlines did not have specific frequencies to work under and an amateur radio operator was interfering with a pilot 's ability to land an aircraft . wireless communication spans the spectrum from 9 & nbsp ; khz to 300 & nbsp ; ghz . applications . mobile telephones . one of the best-known examples of wireless technology is the mobile phone , also known as a cellular phone , with more than 6.6 & nbsp ; billion mobile cellular subscriptions worldwide as of the end of 2010 . robust demand for mobile phone service will continue ; un agency predicts un news centre february 15 , 2010 , these wireless phones use radio waves from signal-transmission towers to enable their users to make phone calls from many locations worldwide . they can be used within range of the cell site used to house the equipment required to transmit and receive the radio signals from these instruments . . data communications . wireless data communications allows wireless networking
