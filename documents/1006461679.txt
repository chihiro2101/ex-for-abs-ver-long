'' i 've been lonely too long '' ( 1967 ) did better , and '' groovin ' '' ( 1 us/canada , 1967 ) returned them to the top of the charts . they reeled off a succession of top 20 us hits , including '' a girl like you '' ( 1967 ) , '' how can i be sure '' ( 1967 ) , '' it 's wonderful '' ( 1968 ) , and '' a beautiful morning '' ( 1968 ) . the band was exceptionally popular in canada where '' a girl like you '' , '' how can i be sure ? '' and '' a beautiful morning '' all reached 1 . but they struggled in the uk , where they only twice reached the top 75 , with '' groovin ' '' ( 8 ) and '' a girl like you '' ( 35 ) . the band would bill themselves as the young rascals for the last time with the single release of '' it 's wonderful '' ; they were known from then as simply 'the rascals' . bruce eder , writing for allmusic , rates the band 's 1967 album groovin ' as their best , noting the record 's soulful core and innovative use of jazz and latin instrumental arrangements . 1968 's once upon a dream was the first rascals album designed from conception as an album , rather than as a vehicle to package their singles ( eight of groovin 's eleven songs had been released as single a or b sides , most in advance of the album ) . once upon a dream , which peaked at 9 on the album charts , contained the single '' it 's wonderful '' . the album 's song '' my hawaii '' became a top of the charts hit in hawaii . time peace : the rascals ' greatest hits , released in mid-1968 , topped the billboard 200 and became the group 's best-selling album . the same year , '' people got to be free '' , a horn-punctuated plea for racial tolerance ( the band was known for refusing to tour on segregated bills ) egan , sean , ed .

'' a ray of hope '' , '' heaven '' , '' see '' , and '' carry me back '' were all modest u.s . hits for the band during late 1968 and 1969 ; all entered the top 40 , but none higher than 24 . in canada , however , the rascals were still major stars ; all these songs went top ten , completing a run of 11 straight canadian top ten hits for the rascals from 1967 to 1969 . december 1969 's '' hold on '' broke the run of top 40 us singles for the rascals , stalling at 51 , as well as the run of canadian top tens , peaking at 22 . brigati left the group in 1970 , followed by cornish in 1971 . their last rascals album was search and nearness ( 198 u.s . ) , which featured brigati 's lead vocals on the cornish-penned '' you do n't know '' , a cover of the box tops ' hit '' the letter '' , and drummer danelli 's composition '' fortunes '' . the only single release from the album to chart was the spiritually themed '' glory , glory '' ( 58 u.s . , 40 canada ) , with backing vocals by the sweet inspirations . search and nearness would be the rascals ' last album for atlantic records , with cavaliere and danelli taking the band to columbia records in mid-1971 . cavaliere shifted towards more jazz- and gospel-influenced writing for the rascals ' next two albums , the double disc peaceful world ( u.s . 122 ) and the island of real ( u.s . 180 ) , using robert popwell and buzzy feiten on bass and guitar respectively , and new singers annie sutton and molly holt . these albums did not sell as well as their earlier work , with none of their associated singles reaching higher than 95 on the u.s . chart . towards the end of 1970 danny weis joined as a replacement for feiten on guitar . feiten then again replaced weis before the group disbanded . post break-up . cavaliere released several solo albums during the 1970s . brigati , with his brother david , released lost in the wilderness in 1976 . cornish and danelli worked together in bulldog , who released two albums — one for mca records in 1973 with the minor hit single '' no '' , the second for buddah in '74 — and fotomaker , who issued three albums on atlantic in 1978-79 . in 1982 , danelli joined steve van zandt in little steven and the disciples of soul for the group 's first two albums . after appearing at atlantic records 40th anniversary celebration on may 14 , 1988 , the rascals reunited ( with cavaliere , cornish , and danelli ) for a brief reunion tour in 1988 . the reunion group featured an expanded lineup that included mel owens ( in brigati 's place ) on vocals and percussion , steve mackey on bass , ed mattey on guitar , dena iverson & cindy mccabe on backup vocals , and a horn section from nashville to beef up the sound . the reunion did not last beyond the end of the year . after that , cavaliere returned to his solo career and in the 1990s there were two factions touring : the new rascals ( featuring cornish and danelli ) and cavaliere , who sometimes called his grouping felix cavaliere 's rascals . the new rascals lasted only a short time but toured again in 2006 with two new members , bill pascali ( formerly of vanilla fudge ) on vocals and keyboards and charlie souza on bass and vocals . the new rascals released a concert dvd , shot at club centro in new jersey on route 35 . in early 2009 , eddie brigati put together a project of young musicians who played all the classics . eddie performed with the group along with his brother david . called the boys from the music house , the band consisted of anthony duke claus , a cousin of eddie 's , on lead vocals and tambourine , joseph pomarico on lead guitar , harmonica and background vocals , adam sullivan on piano , organ , and background vocals , and matt gazzano on drums . on april 24 , 2010 , all four members of the rascals reunited for the kristen ann carr benefit , which was held at new york 's tribeca grill ; bruce springsteen and stevie van zandt joined the band for a closing '' good lovin ' '' . once upon a dream reunion . thumb the group 's original lineup reunited in 2012 for their first public performances in over 40 years with the rascals : once upon a dream , a combination concert/theatrical event that was produced and directed by steven van zandt and maureen van zandt with lighting/projection by marc brickman . in addition to the concert experience , the history of the rascals , and the history of the 1960s through their music , is a combination of interviews with the four rascals , filmed scenes of actors enacting key moments in the band 's history , news footage , and archival footage of the band . the show originally ran for six performances in december 2012 at the capitol theatre in port chester , new york . fifteen performances of the show were subsequently delivered from april 15 to may 5 , 2013 at the richard rodgers theatre on broadway in new york city . the rascals reunite for broadway dates associated press february 22 , 2013 gioia , michael & jones , kenneth .
