Fissile material

fissile vs fissionable . according to the ronen fissile rule , for a heavy element with 90 ≤ z ≤ 100 , its isotopes with 2 × z − n 43 ± 2 , with few exceptions , are fissile ( where n number of neutrons and z number of protons ) . ronen y . , 2006 . a rule for determining fissile isotopes . nucl . sci . eng . , 152:3 , pages 334-335 . group '' note '' > the fissile rule thus formulated indicates 33 isotopes as likely fissile : th-225 , 227 , 229 ; pa-228 , 230 , 232 ; u-231 , 233 , 235 ; np-234 , 236 , 238 ; pu-237 , 239 , 241 ; am-240 , 242 , 244 ; cm-243 , 245 , 247 ; bk-246 , 248 , 250 ; cf-249 , 251 , 253 ; es-252 , 254 , 256 ; fm-255 , 257 , 259 . only fourteen ( including a long-lived metastable nuclear isomer ) have template : ra to es by hl : th-229 , u-233 , u-235 , np-236 , pu-239 , pu-241 , am-242m , cm-243 , cm-245 , cm-247 , bk-248 , cf-249 , cf-251 and es-252 . of these , only u-235 is naturally occurring . it is possible to breed u-233 and pu-239 from more common naturally occurring isotopes ( th-232 and u-238 respectively ) by single neutron capture . the others are typically produced in smaller quantities through : file : sasahara.svg . '' fissile '' is distinct from '' fissionable '' . a nuclide capable of undergoing fission ( even with a low probability ) after capturing a neutron of high or low energy is referred to as '' fissionable '' . a fissionable nuclide that can be induced to fission with low-energy thermal neutrons with a high probability is referred to as '' fissile '' . fissionable materials include also those ( such as uranium-238 ) that can be fissioned only with high-energy neutrons . as a result , fissile materials ( such as uranium-235 ) are a subset of fissionable materials . uranium-235 fissions with low-energy thermal neutrons because the binding energy resulting from the absorption of a neutron is greater than the critical energy required for fission ; therefore uranium-235 is a fissile material . by contrast , the binding energy released by uranium-238 absorbing a thermal neutron is less than the critical energy , so the neutron must possess additional energy for fission to be possible . consequently , uranium-238 is a fissionable material but not a fissile material . an alternative definition defines fissile nuclides as those nuclides that can be made to undergo nuclear fission ( i.e . , & nbsp ; are fissionable ) and also produce neutrons from such fission that can sustain a nuclear chain reaction in the correct setting . under this definition , the only nuclides that are fissionable but not fissile are those nuclides that can be made to undergo nuclear fission but produce insufficient neutrons , in either energy or number , to sustain a nuclear chain reaction . as such , while all fissile isotopes are fissionable , not all fissionable isotopes are fissile . in the arms control context , particularly in proposals for a fissile material cutoff treaty , the term '' fissile '' is often used to describe materials that can be used in the fission primary of a nuclear weapon . fissile materials and nuclear weapons , international panel on fissile materials these are materials that sustain an explosive fast neutron nuclear fission chain reaction . under all definitions above , uranium-238 is fissionable , but because it can not sustain a neutron chain reaction , it is not fissile . neutrons produced by fission of have lower energies than the original neutron ( they behave as in an inelastic scattering ) , usually below 1 mev ( i.e . , & nbsp ; a speed of about 14,000 & nbsp ; km/s ) , the fission threshold to cause subsequent fission of , so fission of does not sustain a nuclear chain reaction . fast fission of in the secondary stage of a nuclear weapon contributes greatly to yield and to fallout . the fast fission of also makes a significant contribution to the power output of some fast-neutron reactors . fissile nuclides . in general , most actinide isotopes with an odd neutron number are fissile . most nuclear fuels have an odd atomic mass number ( a z + n the total number of nucleons ) , and an even atomic number z . this implies an odd number of neutrons . isotopes with an odd number of neutrons gain an extra 1 to 2 mev of energy from absorbing an extra neutron , from the pairing effect which favors even numbers of both neutrons and protons . this energy is enough to supply the needed extra energy for fission by slower neutrons , which is important for making fissionable isotopes also fissile . more generally , nuclides with an even number of protons and an even number of neutrons , and located near a well-known curve in nuclear physics of atomic number vs . atomic mass number are more stable than others ; hence , they are less likely to undergo fission . they are more likely to '' ignore '' isotopes are also less likely to undergo spontaneous fission , and they also have relatively much longer partial half-lives for alpha or beta decay . examples of these isotopes are uranium-238 and thorium-232 . on the other hand , other than the lightest nuclides , nuclides with an odd number of protons and an odd number of neutrons ( odd z , odd n ) are usually short-lived ( a notable exception is neptunium-236 with a half-life of 154,000 years ) because they readily beta decay to their isobars with an even number of protons and an even number of neutrons ( even z , even n ) becoming much more stable . the physical basis for this phenomenon also comes from the pairing effect in nuclear binding energy , but this time from both proton–proton and neutron–neutron pairing . the relatively short half-life of such odd-odd heavy isotopes means that they are not available in quantity and are highly radioactive . nuclear fuel . to be a useful fuel for nuclear fission chain reactions , the material must : be in the region of the binding energy curve where a fission chain reaction is possible ( i.e . , & nbsp ; above radium ) have a high probability of fission on neutron capture release more than one neutron on average per neutron capture . ( enough of them on each fission , to compensate for nonfissions , and absorptions in the moderator ) have a reasonably long half-life be available in suitable quantities fissile nuclides in nuclear fuels include : uranium-235 which occurs in natural uranium and enriched uranium plutonium-239 bred from uranium-238 by neutron capture plutonium-241 bred from plutonium-240 by neutron capture . the comes from by the same process . uranium-233 bred from thorium-232 by neutron capture fissile nuclides do not have a 100 % chance of undergoing fission on absorption of a neutron . the chance is dependent on the nuclide as well as neutron energy . for low and medium-energy neutrons , the neutron capture cross sections for fission ( σ f ) , the cross section for neutron capture with emission of a gamma ray ( σ γ ) , and the percentage of non-fissions are in the table at right .
