'' to which the cat replies '' in that direction lives a hatter , and in that direction , lives a march hare . visit either you like : they 're both mad ! '' both then subsequently make their actual debuts in the seventh chapter of the same book , which is titled '' a mad tea-party '' . hat making was the main trade in stockport where carroll grew up , and it was not unusual then for hatters to appear disturbed or confused ; many died early as a result of mercury poisoning . however , the hatter does not exhibit the symptoms of mercury poisoning , which include excessive timidity , diffidence , increasing shyness , loss of self-confidence , anxiety , and a desire to remain unobserved and unobtrusive . hauth , waldron ( 24 december 1983 ) .

'' . carroll originally intended the riddle to be without an answer , but after many requests from readers , he and others—including puzzle expert sam loyd—suggested possible answers ; in his preface to the 1896 edition of alice 's adventures in wonderland , carroll wrote : loyd proposed a number of alternative solutions to the riddle , including '' because poe wrote on both '' ( alluding to poe 's 1845 narrative poem the raven ) and '' because the notes for which they are noted are not noted for being musical notes '' . the april 2017 edition of bandersnatch , the newsletter of the lewis carroll society issue 172 , , apr 2017 , published the following solution , proposed by puzzle expert rick hosburn : '' why is a raven like a writing-desk ? '' '' because one is a crow with a bill , while the other is a bureau with a quill !

'' owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly had a more mixed opinion and commented that depp as the hatter is '' a fantastic image , but once depp opens his mouth , what comes out is a noisome scottish brogue that makes everything he says sound more or less the same . the character offers no captivatingly skewed bat-house psychology . there is n't much to him , really—he 's just a smiling johnny one-note with a secret hip-hop dance move—and so we start to react to him the way that alice does to everything else : by wondering when he 's going to stop making nonsense .
