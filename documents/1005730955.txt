Świnoujście

history . the first human settlements , in areas that are now świnoujście appeared five thousand years ago , as confirmed by archaeological findings . for a thousand years the estuary of the river was part of the state of the świnoujście who were included in the emerging polish state in the 10th century by first polish ruler mieszko i . in the early 12th-century the island became part of the duchy of pomerania , founded as a vassal duchy of poland . in later centuries local pomeranian princes ruled the area , and on both sides of the river , they built fortified castles , which were destroyed several times by the danish invasions in the twelfth century in 1170 and 1173 . between 1185 and 1227 the settlement was part of a danish fief . during the thirty years ' war ( 1618–1648 ) the city became part of the swedish empire . the strait świna was formerly flanked by the fishing villages of westswine and ostswine . towards the beginning of the 17th century it was made navigable for large ships . the kingdom of prussia gained the area in 1720 from sweden , and included it in her pomeranian province . świnoujście ( swinemünde ) was founded on the site of westswine in 1748 , fortified , and received town privileges from king frederick ii of prussia in 1765 . it served as the outer port of szczecin and was administered within the province of pomerania . swinemünde became part of the german empire after the kingdom of prussia completed the unification of germany in 1871 . the town had broad unpaved streets and one-story houses built in the dutch style , which gave it an almost rustic appearance , although its industries , beyond some fishing , were entirely connected with its shipping . the river mouth , which was the entrance to the harbor , and which was regarded as the best on the prussian baltic coast , was then protected by two curving long breakwaters , and was strongly fortified . on the island of wolin , on the other side of the narrow świna , a great lighthouse was erected . in 1897 the canal of the piast canal was opened to navigation , and this waterway between the stettin harbour and the baltic sea was deepened between 1900 and 1901 . from then on stettin could be reached directly by ships , and swinemünde 's importance diminished somewhat . during world war ii , germany operated a forced labour subcamp of the stalag ii-d prisoner-of-war camp in the city . jolanta aniszewska , w obowiązku pamięci . stalag ii d i formy upamiętnienia jeńców wojennych w stargardzie szczecińskim , '' łambinowicki rocznik muzealny '' tom 34 , opole , 2011

april 1945 . on 16 april 1945 , a british heavy bomber of the no . 617 squadron raf was shot down by the germans , and is now commemorated with a memorial on the karsibór island within the city limits . the unfinished was scuttled in the harbor in an attempt to prevent its capture by the advancing red army ( it was nevertheless refloated by the soviets later ) . the german battleship had also participated in the defence of the city , before it too was scuttled . after the fortress division swinemünde were evacuated , soviet forces occupied the city on the night of 4–5 may 1945 . after germany 's defeat in the war , the soviet union imposed new borders in eastern europe at the potsdam conference , which made the area , including świnoujście , a part of poland . the entire population was expelled in accordance to the potsdam agreement and replaced by ethnic poles . the treaty of zgorzelec signed between the people 's republic of poland and the german democratic republic affirmed the new border , and the german–polish border treaty ( 1990 ) officially affirmed the existing borders after revolutions of 1989 . in the winter of 1945 , some members of the communist polish security forces who had been victims of german concentration camps carried out atrocities against local germans . an investigation in 2008 estimated that over 40 german civilians were killed . nine men were charged with the murder and maltreatment of germans , and in 1947 , after one escaped and one hanged himself , seven of them stood trial . the harshest sentence given in that trial was a mere 4 years ' imprisonment , for theft . in another trial , the town 's chief of police , jan zientara , was sentenced to eight years , for organizing robberies of german civilians . in 1948 , the reconstruction and reconstruction of the port of świnoujście from martial to commercial and fishing began . the construction of a large fish farm began , a huge swimming pool and industrial buildings were built , and 3 years later the fisheries base was commissioned . within three years , a large fish factory was established , managed by the independent przedsiębiorstwo usług rybackie odra in świnoujście . it

53 54 49.11 n 14 11′11.18 e ) . in return , germany was granted a similar area between the water intake and the pomeranian bay . the spa part of the city was occupied by the soviet armed forces until
