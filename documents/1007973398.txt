Mount Waddington

discovery and exploration by europeans . in 1925 , while on a trip to mount arrowsmith , vancouver island , don and phyllis munday spotted what they believed to be a peak taller than mount robson , the then accepted tallest peak entirely within british columbia . in the words of don munday , '' the compass showed the alluring peak stood along a line passing a little east of bute inlet and perhaps 150 miles away , where blank spaces on the map left ample room for many nameless mountains . '' munday p . 4 while there is debate as to whether the peak they saw was mount waddington ( don munday observed that the feat is impossible ) , fairley p . 59 they almost certainly saw a peak in the waddington range , and this led the mundays to explore that area . over the next decade , the mundays mounted several expeditions into the area in an attempt to climb it . known to them as '' the mystery mountain '' , in 1927 the height was measured at 13,260 feet by triangulation ; munday p . 124 they reached the lower summit in 1928 , deeming the main summit too risky . on their recommendation the geographical names board of canada gave it the name mount waddington after alfred waddington who was a proponent of a road route , known as waddington 's road , and again later the same for a railway , via the homathko river valley and bute inlet , which would connect to vancouver island via seymour narrows . in the summer of 1934 , two expeditions attempted to climb the mountain . the first expedition , made up of climbers from winnipeg , made their attempt on the northwestern flank which had not been explored by the mundays . after crossing tatlayoko lake and making their way down the homathko river , they then spent two days constructing a bridge over nude creek before reaching the tiedemann glacier on june 23 . it took them three days to reach the shoulder of mt . waddington at . they attempted the summit on june 28 but poor weather and route conditions on the final tower forced them to retreat , from the top . scott , pp . 113-114 the second expedition , consisting of climbers from british columbia , made their attempt from the southeast . on june 23 , they established their base camp on the franklin glacier . the ascent abruptly ended three days later when one of the climbers fell to his death from the southeast ridge . scott , p . 114 in 1935 , a group of climbers from the sierra club of california made three attempts from their base camp at the dais glacier . the group failed in two attempts on the south face due to stormy conditions , poor route conditions and falling ice . two climbers succeeded in reaching the northwest summit ( first climbed by the mundays ) on a third attempt but proceeded no further . . first ascent . on july 4 , 1936 , fritz wiessner , bill house , elizabeth woolsey and alan willcox reached the head of the knight inlet . for the next twelve days they ferried loads to their base camp at icefall point on the dais glacier . while on the glacier , they were joined by another expedition led by members of the british columbia mountaineering club and the sierra club . wiessner and house agreed to allow the others a first chance at the summit but this group failed to find a route up the south face . scott , pp . 114-116 on july 20 , wiessner and house first attempted the line of a great couloir that comes directly down between the main summit tower and the northwest peak . it was an excellent line for quickly ascending but they were unable to traverse onto the south face proper due to poor rock conditions and were forced to retreat to base camp . by 3 am the next morning they were already climbing up a couloir to the right of the face . good weather the past few days had cleared most of the snow away from the ledges making for good climbing conditions . following the left branch of the couloir , they reached a snow patch in the middle of the face . the final of the south face then presented a fierce hurdle of '' sheer forbidding-looking rocks '' as noted by wiessner . while wiessner initially started in boots , he quickly changed to rope-soled shoes and gave his ice axe and extra rope to house . wiessner led several pitches up technically difficult rock including several overhangs . after traversing east across the face they rested on a ledge just below the southeastern ridge , a full 9 hours since leaving the snow patch on the south face . after climbing a short chimney they finally reached the small snowy mass at the top , 13 hours after their start in base camp . they aborted their earlier plan of descending the shorter north face and retraced their ascent line , reaching their tent on the dais glacier at 2 am . the ascent to the summit and back to base camp had taken over 23 hours . . notable ascents . 1936 south face fa by fritz wiessner and bill house . 1942 south face 2nd ascent by helmut and fred beckey . 1977 south face variation fa of route , 3rd ascent of south face by jack tackle and kenneth currens . 2012 flavelle-lane route first solo ascent of the peak by colin haley . haley , colin .
