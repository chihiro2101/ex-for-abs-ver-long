Aspidistra

description . species of aspidistra are perennial herbaceous plants growing from rhizomes . the leaves are either solitary or are grouped in small '' tufts '' of two to four . they arise more or less directly from the rhizome , rather than being borne on stems . each leaf has a long stalk ( petiole ) and a blade with many veins . the flowering stem ( scape ) is usually very short so that the flowers appear low down among the leaves . the fleshy flowers are bell- , urn- or cup-shaped . they vary considerably in size and shape , although few are showy . the flowers of a . & nbsp ; longipedunculata are yellow and , unusually for the genus , are borne on scapes up to high . a . & nbsp ; grandiflora has spider-like flowers up to across . the flower has a large stigma with a flattened top . the fruit is a berry , often with a single seed . , in . taxonomy . the genus aspidistra was named by the english botanist john ker gawler in 1822 , as a blend of greek ασπίς/ασπίδ- aspid- and the genus name tupistra . oxford english dictionary , 1933 , s.v . the genus was at one time placed in a broadly defined liliaceae , along with many other lilioid monocots . it has also been placed in the families convallariaceae and ruscaceae . the apg iii system of 2009 places it in the family asparagaceae , subfamily nolinoideae . . species . aspidistra is a genus that was largely ignored by field botanists until the 1980s onwards , and there has been a very rapid rise in the number of recognised species since then . some 8 to 10 species were known in the late 1970s ; 30 new species were described from china in the 1980s . subsequently more new species were found in vietnam . the online flora of china uses a narrow definition of species , producing a total of about 55 , saying that the genus has '' never been well studied '' . in 2008 , tillich provided a key to the 93 species known at that time . , the world checklist of selected plant families ( wcsp ) accepted 101 species : search for '' aspidistra '' , aspidistra acetabuliformis y.wan & c.c.huang – china ( guangxi ) aspidistra alata tillich – vietnam ( cao bang ) aspidistra albiflora c.r.lin aspidistra alternativa d.fang & l.y.yu – china ( guangxi ) aspidistra arnautovii tillich – vietnam ( hai phong ) aspidistra atroviolacea tillich – vietnam ( thua thien ) aspidistra austrosinensis y.wan & c.c.huang – china ( guangxi ) aspidistra basalis tillich aspidistra bicolor tillich – vietnam ( thai nguyen ) aspidistra bogneri tillich – vietnam ( ninh binh ) aspidistra brachystyla aver . & tillich – vietnam aspidistra caespitosa c.pei – china ( sichuan ) aspidistra campanulata tillich – vietnam ( tuyen quang ) aspidistra carinata y.wan & x.h.lu – china ( n guangxi ) aspidistra carnosa tillich – vietnam ( lam dong ) aspidistra cavicola d.fang & k.c.yen – china ( nw guangxi ) aspidistra cerina g.z.li & s.c.tang – china ( guangxi ) aspidistra chishuiensis s.z.he & w.f.xu aspidistra claviformis y.wan – china ( w guangxi ) aspidistra coccigera aver . & tillich aspidistra columellaris tillich aspidistra connata tillich – vietnam ( gialai-kontum ) aspidistra cruciformis y.wan & x.h.lu – china ( nw guangxi ) aspidistra cryptantha tillich – vietnam ( cao bang ) aspidistra cyathiflora y.wan & c.c.huang – china ( guangxi ) aspidistra daibuensis hayata – taiwan aspidistra dodecandra ( gagnep . ) tillich – indo-china aspidistra dolichanthera x.x.chen – china ( sw guangxi ) aspidistra ebianensis k.y.lang & z.y.zhu – china ( sichuan ) aspidistra elatior blume – japan ( ōsumi islands ) aspidistra erecta yan liu & c.i peng aspidistra fasciaria g.z.li – china ( ?

'' the biggest aspidistra in the world '' aspidistras can withstand deep shade , neglect , dry soil , hot temperatures and polluted in-door air ( from burning coal or natural gas ) but are sensitive to bright sunlight . '' aspidistra '' was the codename ( inspired by the above song ) of a aspidistra ( transmitter ) used for propaganda and deception purposes against nazi germany during world war ii . the 1980 's british television show the adventure game featured a moving aspidistra called the rangdo of arg , operated by kenny baker . . references . notes . . bibliography . . external links . gallery of aspidistra juniper level botanic gardens aspidistra collection
