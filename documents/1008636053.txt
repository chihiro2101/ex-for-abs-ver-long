summary . image : wedding and engagement rings 2151px.jpg thumbnail a white gold wedding ring and a single-diamond , gold-banded engagement ring . in many cultures , wives show their marital status through various symbols . the word is of germanic origin , from proto-germanic wībam , '' woman '' . in middle english it had the form wif , and in old english wīf , '' woman or wife '' . it is related to modern german weib ( woman , female ) , etymology of '' weib '' ( broken link to a uni personal account ) and danish viv ( wife , usually poetic ) and may derive ultimately from the indo-european root ghwībh- '' shame ; pudenda '' ( cf . tocharian b kwīpe and tocharian a kip , each meaning '' female pudenda '' , with clear sexual overtones ) . watkins , the american heritage dictionary of indo-european roots , p . 32 . the original meaning of the phrase '' wife '' as simply '' woman '' , unconnected with marriage or a husband/wife , is preserved in words such as '' midwife '' , '' goodwife '' , '' fishwife '' and '' spaewife '' . in many cultures , marriage is generally expected that a woman will take her husband 's surname , though that is not universal . a married woman may indicate her marital status in a number of ways : in western culture a married woman would commonly wear a wedding ring but in other cultures other markers of marital status may be used . a married woman is commonly given the honorific title '' mrs '' , but some married women prefer to be referred to as '' ms '' , a title which is also used by preference or when the marital status of a woman is unknown . related terminology . a woman on her wedding day is usually described as a bride , even after the wedding ceremony , while being described as a wife is also appropriate after the wedding or after the honeymoon . if she is marrying a man , her partner is known as the groom during the wedding , and within the marriage is called her husband . in the older custom , still followed , e . g . , by roman catholic ritual , the word bride actually means fiancée and applies up to the exchange of matrimonial consent ( the actual marriage act ) ; from then on , even while the rest of the very ceremony is ongoing , the woman is a wife , and no longer a bride , and the bridal couple is no longer referred to as such but as the newlywed couple . '' wife '' refers to the institutionalized relation to the other spouse , unlike mother , a term that puts a woman into the context of her children . in some societies , especially historically , a concubine was a woman who was in an ongoing , usually matrimonially oriented relationship with a man who could not be married to her , often because of a difference in social status . the term wife is most commonly applied to a woman in a union sanctioned by law ( including religious law ) , not to a woman in an informal cohabitation relationship , which may be known as a girlfriend , partner , cohabitant , significant other , concubine , mistress etc . however , a woman in a so-called common law marriage may describe herself as a common law wife , de facto wife , or simply a wife . those seeking to advance gender neutrality may refer to both marriage partners as '' spouses '' , and many countries and societies are rewording their statute law by replacing '' wife '' and '' husband '' with '' spouse '' . a former wife whose spouse is deceased is a widow . termination of the status of a wife . the status of a wife may be terminated by divorce , annulment , or the death of a spouse . in the case of divorce , terminology such as former-wife or ex-wife is often used . with regard to annulment , such terms are not , strictly speaking , correct , because annulment , unlike divorce , is usually retroactive , meaning that an annulled marriage is considered to be invalid from the beginning almost as if it had never taken place . in the case of the death of the other spouse , the term used is widow . the social status of such women varies by culture , but in some places , they may be subject to potentially harmful practices , such as widow inheritance or levirate marriage ; or divorced women may be socially stigmatized . in some cultures , the termination of the status of wife made life itself meaningless , as in the case of those cultures that practiced sati , a funeral ritual within some asian communities , in which a recently widowed woman self-immolation , typically on the husband 's funeral pyre . legal rights of the wife . the legal rights of a wife have been since the 19th century , and still are , in many jurisdictions subject to debate . this subject was in particular addressed by john stuart mill , in the subjection of women ( 1869 ) . historically , many societies have given sets of rights and obligations to husbands that have been very different from the sets of rights and obligations given to wives . in particular , the control of marital property , inheritance rights , and the right to dictate the activities of children of the marriage , have typically been given to male marital partners . however , this practice was curtailed to a great deal in many countries in the twentieth century , and more modern statutes tend to define the rights and duties of a spouse without reference to gender . among the last european countries to establish full gender equality in marriage were switzerland , in 1985 , a referendum guaranteed women legal equality with men within marriage . the new reforms came into force in january 1988.women 's movements of the world : an international directory and reference guide , edited by sally shreir , p . 254 greece , in 1983 , legislation was passed guaranteeing equality between spouses , abolishing dowry , and ending legal discrimination against illegitimate children vasilikie .

spain , in 1981 , spain abolished the requirement that married women must have their husbands ’ permission to initiate judicial proceedings and france although married women in france obtained the right to work without their husbands ' permission in 1965 , and the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 ( before that parental responsibilities belonged to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children ) , it was only in 1985 that a legal reform abolished the stipulation that the husband had the sole power to administer the children 's property . in the 1980s . in various marriage laws around the world , however , the husband continues to have authority ; for instance the civil code of iran states at article 1105 : '' in relations between husband and wife ; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband '' . . exchanges of goods or money . image : thai bride price 2008.jpg thumb right a traditional , formal presentation of the bride price at a thai engagement ceremony . traditionally , and still in some parts of the world , the bride or her family bring her husband a dowry , or the husband or his family pay a bride price to the bride 's family , or both are exchanged between the families ; or the husband pays the wife a dower . the purpose of the dowry varies by culture and has varied historically . in some cultures , it was paid not only to support the establishment of a new family , but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife , the dowry had to be returned to the wife or her family ; but during the marriage , the dowry was often made inalienable by the husband . britannica 2005 , dowry today , dowries continue to be expected in parts of south asia such as india , pakistan , nepal , bangladesh , and sri lanka , and conflicts related to their payment sometimes result in violence such as dowry deaths and bride burning . changing of name upon marriage . in some cultures , particularly in the anglophone west , wives often change their surnames to that of the husband upon getting married . for some , this is a controversial practice , due to its tie to the historical doctrine of coverture and to the historically subordinated roles of wives . others argue that today this is merely a harmless tradition that should be accepted as a free choice . some jurisdictions consider this practice as discriminatory and contrary to women 's rights , and have restricted or banned it ; for example , since 1983 , when greece adopted a new marriage law which guaranteed gender equality between the spouses , women in greece are required to keep their birth names for their whole life . . childbearing . traditionally , and still in many cultures , the role of a wife was closely tied to that of a mother , by a strong expectation that a wife ought to bear children , while , conversely , an unmarried woman should not have a child out of wedlock . these views have changed in many parts of the world . children born outside marriage have become more common in many countries . although some wives in particular in western countries childfree , such a choice is not accepted in some parts of the world . in northern ghana , for example , the payment of bride price signifies a woman 's requirement to bear children , and women using birth control are at risk of threats and coercion . pdf . in addition , some religions are interpreted as requiring children in marriage ; for instance pope francis said in 2015 that choosing not to have children was '' selfish '' . . differences in cultures . antiquity . many traditions like a dower , dowry and bride price have long traditions in antiquity . the exchange of any item or value goes back to the oldest sources , and the wedding ring likewise was always used as a symbol for keeping faith to a person . western cultures . . historical status . in ancient rome , the emperor augustus introduced marriage legislation , the lex papia poppaea , which rewarded marriage and childbearing . the legislation also imposed penalties on young persons who failed to marry and on those who committed adultery . therefore , marriage and childbearing was made law between the ages of twenty-five and sixty for men , and twenty and fifty for women . mary t . boatwright , daniel j . gargola , noel

new testament in regard to their view on the position of a wife in society as well as her marriage . the new testament condemns divorce for both men and women ( 1 cor 7:10–11 ) , and assumes monogamy on the part of the husband : the wife is to have her '' own '' husband , and the husband is to have his '' own '' wife ( 1 cor 7:2 ) . in the medieval period , this was understood to mean that a wife should not share a husband with other wives . as a result , divorce was relatively uncommon in the pre-modern west , particularly in the medieval and early modern period , and husbands in the roman , later medieval and early modern period did not publicly take more than one wife . in pre-modern times , it was unusual to marry for love alone , william c . horne , making a heaven of hell : the

industrial age oxford , 1993 , pp . 55–56 . the new testament made no pronouncements about wives ' property rights , which in practice were influenced more by secular laws than religion . most influential in the pre-modern west was the civil law , except in english-speaking countries where english common law emerged in the high middle ages . in addition , local customary law influenced wives ' property rights ; as a result wives ' property rights in the pre-modern west varied widely from region to region . because wives ' property rights and daughters ' inheritance rights varied widely from region to region due to differing legal systems , the amount of property a wife might own varied greatly . under the english common law system , which dates to the later medieval period , daughters and younger sons were usually excluded from landed property if no will was produced . under english common law , there was a system where a wife with a living husband ( '' feme couvert '' ) could own little property in her own name . elizabeth m . craik , marriage and property , aberdeen 1984 unable to easily support herself , marriage was very important to most women 's economic status . this problem has been dealt with extensively in literature , where the most important reason for women 's limited power was the denial of equal education and equal property rights for females . in the 18th and 19th centuries , which contained much criticism of these facts , see also mary wollstonecraft , a vindication of the rights of women , boston 1792 the situation was assessed by the english conservative moralist sir william blackstone : '' the husband and wife are one , and the husband is the one . '' william blackstone , commentaries upon the laws of england married women 's property rights in the english-speaking world improved with the married women 's property act 1882 and similar legal changes , which allowed wives with living husbands to own property in their own names . until late in the 20th century , women could in some regions or times sue a man for wreath money when he took her virginity without taking her as his wife . brockhaus 2004 , kranzgeld . if a woman did not want to marry , another option was entering a convent as a nun . though cloisters ' practices were not bound by modern national borders , see sources for spain , for italy , and for britain to become a '' bride of christ '' , a state in which her chastity and economic survival would be protected . both a wife and a nun wore christian headcovering , which proclaimed their state of protection by the rights of marriage . silvia evangelisti , wives , widows , and brides of christ : marriage and the convent in the historiography of early modern italy , cambridge 2000 much more significant than the option of becoming a nun , was the option of non-religious spinsterhood in the west . an unmarried woman , a feme sole , had the right to own property and make contracts in her own name . as first demonstrated quantitatively by john hajnal , in the 19th and early 20th centuries the percentage of non-clerical western women who never married was typically as high as 10–15 % , a prevalence of female celibacy never yet documented for any other major traditional civilization . john hajnal , '' european marriage patterns in perspective '' in d.e . glass and d.e.c . eversley eds . population in history london , 1965 . in addition , early modern western women married at quite high ages ( typically mid to late 20s ) relative to other major traditional cultures . the high age at first marriage for western women has been shown by many parish reconstruction studies to be a traditional western marriage pattern that dates back at least as early as the mid-16th century . michael flynn , the european demographic system , 1500-1820 johns hopkins , 1981 , pp . 124–127 . . contemporary status . in the 20th century , the role of the wife in western marriage changed in two major ways ; the first was the breakthrough from an '' institution to companionate marriage '' ; '' companionship marriage '' and '' companionate marriage '' are synonyms ( the latter being the older one ) , although the term usually refers to a relationship based on equality , it might instead refer to a marriage with mutual interest in their children , for the first time since the middle ages , wives became distinct legal entities , and were allowed their own property and allowed to sue . until then , partners were a single legal entity , but only a husband was allowed to exercise this right , called coverture . the second change was the drastic alteration of middle and upper-class family life , when in the 1960s these wives began to work outside their home , and with the social acceptance of divorces the single-parent family , and stepfamily or '' blended family '' as a more '' individualized marriage '' . today , some women may wear a wedding ring in order to show her status as a wife . howard , vicki .
