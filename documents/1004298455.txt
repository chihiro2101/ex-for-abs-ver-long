De Havilland

history . origins . in january 1920 geoffrey de havilland was working for airco as technical director and chief designer . bsa bought airco on 20 january 1920 from george holt thomas on the say-so of one bsa director , percy martin , having done inadequate due diligence . within days bsa discovered airco 's true circumstances and shut it down in july 1920 . the resulting losses were so great bsa was unable to pay a dividend for the next four years . davenport-hines 2002 , p . 216 . with thomas 's help , de havilland took modest premises at the nearby stag lane aerodrome and formed a limited liability company , de havilland aircraft company limited , incorporated 26 september 1920 . the directors were de havilland , arthur edwin turner who had come from the war office , and chief engineer charles clement walker . nominal capital was £50,000 . flight magazine , 7 october 1920 , p . 1070 . most of the capital came from geoffrey de havilland ( £3,000 ) and george holt thomas ( £10,000 ) , with various others adding a further £1,000 .
