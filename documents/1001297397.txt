The Ataris

history . kung fu records ( 1996–2001 ) . formed on november 1 , 1996 , the band originally consisted of singer , songwriter , and guitarist kristopher roe and guitarist jasin thomason . using a 4-track , roe wrote and recorded demos in his bedroom , using a drum machine while he searched for a full-time drummer . the band 's first big break came in 1996 when roe attended a show at the club bogart 's in cincinnati , where thomason passed one of the band 's demo tapes to a roadie from the band . the roadie gave the tape to joe escalante , bassist from the band the vandals who owned their own label , kung fu records . a few weeks later , roe received a call from kung fu records , who told him they were interested in putting out their record , even though he was really only searching for a drummer . the ataris signed to kung fu and the label passed the tape along to various drummers . eventually , roe decided upon ex-lagwagon drummer derrick plourde . the band then proceeded to record their debut album anywhere but here , tracking the whole thing in less than a week . the album was released on april 29 , 1997 and the band held a release show party at missing link records in indianapolis on may 2 . in june 1997 , roe moved from anderson , indiana to santa barbara , california . shortly afterward , marko desantis joined the band on bass for a short time . thomason decided to leave the band to stay in indiana , and the group toured as a three-piece for a short while . after a brief tour in october 1997 , this lineup disbanded . roe , out of money and living in a van , contemplated moving back to indiana . but the band still had an upcoming tour booked with dance hall crashers and unwritten law , so roe decided to give the band one more shot . he got his friend from santa barbara , mike davenport , to play bass . davenport shared a small rehearsal space on east haley street with his friend marco peña , who was in a different band . one day at the rehearsal space , roe and davenport heard the drummer of peña 's band , chris knapp , playing and immediately asked him to join the ataris . while roe and davenport joked that peña would be upset over them '' stealing '' his band 's drummer , peña surprised them by showing up at their practice the next day , strapping on his guitar , and playing along . it turned out peña had learned all the songs from anywhere but here . he joined the band as a second guitarist and the foursome went on their scheduled tour . however , peña soon left the band due to personal reasons and was replaced by patrick riley . from there , the band gradually increased in popularity in the underground rock scene due to their consistent touring and personal , diy approach to the band . they then found more success with their 1998 ep look forward to failure , released on san francisco punk label fat wreck chords . however , it was n't until the release of blue skies , broken hearts.next 12 exits in 1999 that they started to gain widespread acclaim . the album 's name comes from the name of a mobile home park along highway 101 in santa barbara . also , '' . next 12 exits '' refers to a nearby sign on highway 101 north that reads '' santa barbara , next 12 exits '' . the album contained personal , storytelling lyrics . after this album , riley left the band to go back to school , and marco peña re-joined the band . in 2001 the band took part in the vans warped tour . '' live : vans warped 2001 '' . chart attack , august 23 , 2001 . review by : vanessa bruno the band 's third full-length studio album , end is forever , was also released in 2001 . so long , astoria ( 2002–04 ) . in 2002 , the lineup changed again , with john collura replacing peña on guitar . prior to this , collura had played in his own band beefcake who 'd toured with the ataris . he 'd also done time on tour as a guitar tech for the ataris just prior to peña 's departure . during this same period , the ataris ' contract with kung fu records expired , and the band chose to sign with columbia records . later that year , they began recording their fourth full-length album and major label debut , so long , astoria , released on march 4 , 2003 . produced by lou giordano , the album 's production served as a stark contrast to any of the band 's past releases , as previous efforts were recorded in short time spans between tours . so long , astoria was widely credited for introducing the ataris to a larger mainstream audience and generating several successful singles , including '' in this diary '' and '' the saddest song '' . musically , the album showcased very personal , encrypted and slightly more optimistic songwriting with a more refined , straightforward rock sound , not unlike jimmy eat world . this album also included their hit cover song , originally recorded by don henley , '' the boys of summer '' , which much to the dismay of the band became their '' accidental '' second single after the radio station kroq in los angeles started playing it , even though the band had already chosen the song '' my reply '' as their second single . the single is their highest-charting single to date , reaching no . & nbsp ; 20 on the billboard hot 100 . the band toured behind this record for most of 2003 and into early 2004 . that year also saw the release of a low-key live album , live at the metro , along with a track on the spider-man 2 soundtrack . so long , astoria sold over 700,000 copies and was certified gold . after a number of personal , financial and artistic differences , this line-up decided to go its separate ways over the summer and fall of 2004 . davenport , interested in playing heavier music , became a founding member of the band versus the world , while knapp stopped playing music altogether and stayed in santa barbara . looking for some time off , roe headed back to indiana while collura moved back to new york ; though they would later regroup to begin the recordings of the band 's next album . welcome the night ( 2005–07 ) . after some time off , roe and collura later moved forward and began writing songs that would become part of the follow-up to so long , astoria titled welcome the night . they held some informal practices with some friends from new york , who played in the band park ranger . these sessions led to three members of park ranger joining the ataris : sean hansen on bass , shane chickeles on drums , and paul carabello on third guitar . to round out the lineup they added longtime friends bob hoag , formerly of pollen and the go reflex ( which was managed by roe ) , on piano and keyboards , and angus cooke on cello . cooke played cello on past ataris records , and helped with production as well . starting in 2005 , the band began recording welcome the night at seedy underbelly in california , with producer nick launay . writing and recording eventually took the better part of two years and was extended to multiple studios . the album was routinely delayed by columbia . on june 10 , 2006 , the band announced that it had left columbia records due to the label 's internal disintegration . in november 2006 , the ataris started their own imprint , isola recordings , through sanctuary records and red distribution , and simultaneously announced the official release date of their fifth album welcome the night as february 20 , 2007 . welcome the night debuted at number 85 on the billboard charts with over 12,000 copies sold . following the album 's release , the band embarked on a tour of the united states and europe . the graveyard of the atlantic ( 2008–present ) . in june 2008 , the band began demoing at the gallows recording studio in muncie , indiana in preparation for recording in late summer , with the aim of releasing a new album in 2009 . in november , the band posted a clip of a demo online . the following month , the band entered the studio to record their next album . on december 29 , it was mentioned that drums had been completed and that guitars were next . in january 2009 , the band went on a tour of the uk . on april 12 , a demo titled '' all souls ' day '' was posted on the group 's myspace . in addition , it was mentioned that their next album would be released in the summer . in 2010 , a two track ep , all souls ' day & the graveyard of the atlantic containing just its title tracks was released under the paper + plastick label . in 2012 , the band released a four track ep entitled the graveyard of the atlantic . from 2013 , the ataris began a north american tour with kris roe as singer and the former members
