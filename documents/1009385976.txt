A-ha

biography . formation . the trio , composed of lead vocalist morten harket ; guitarist pål waaktaar-savoy and keyboardist magne furuholmen , formed in 1982 and left norway for london in order to make a career in music . '' we were trying to think of what to call themselves , focusing on norwegian words people could say in english . '' they jettisoned that idea when morten spotted a song called '' a-ha '' in waaktaar 's songbook . '' it was a terrible song but a great name , '' says morten . rolling stone ; circa 1986 . '' the icemen cometh '' by david fricke , page 18 . they chose the studio of musician , producer , and soon-to-be-manager john ratcliff because it had a space invaders machine . john ratcliff introduced them to his manager , terry slater , and after a few meetings , a-ha enlisted ratcliff as a manager as well . slater and ratcliff formed tj management . ratcliff dealt with technical and musical aspects and slater acted as the group 's international business manager and as liaison to warner brothers ' head office in los angeles . hunting high and low ( 1984–1986 ) . an early version of '' take on me '' was the first song that morten harket had heard magne furuholmen and pål waaktaar play in asker . at that time , the song was called '' miss eerie '' and the two men were still known as bridges . morten said it sounded more like a '' juicy fruit song '' for a gum advertisement . a-ha 's first recorded version , called '' lesson one '' , was released in 1984 and promoted with a video of the band performing the song in front of a blue background . after it failed to chart , the song was re-recorded with production by alan tarney , and again failed to chart . finally , the song was re-recorded and re-released in 1985 with a new , groundbreaking video ; this time , the song peaked at number one on the us billboard hot 100 and at number two on the uk singles chart . a-ha became the first norwegian band to have a number one hit in the u.s . the popularity of '' take on me '' earned the band a spot on the american television series soul train in 1985 , making them one of the few white artists to appear on the black music-oriented show . ( earlier soul train appearances by white artists included gino vanelli , elton john , david bowie , hall & oates , sheena easton , and teena marie . ) the video used a pencil-sketch animation/live-action combination called rotoscope , in which individual frames of live video are drawn over or coloured . it became one of the most instantly recognisable and most enduringly popular music videos in the us , where it was nominated for eight awards at the third annual mtv video awards in 1986 , winning six , including best new artist in a video , best concept video , best direction , best special effects , and viewer 's choice and best video of the year . their six mtv award wins for that video gave them twice as many wins as michael jackson 's '' thriller '' and more than any artist in the three years of the awards combined . the band 's second single worldwide was '' the sun always shines on t.v . '' , even though '' love is reason '' was the second single in norway . in the us , the song peaked at number 20 on the billboard hot 100 and reached number 17 on radio & records airplay chart . a remix version was a club hit , rising to number 5 on the hot dance singles sales chart . the music video for the song was another popular and critical success , nominated in three categories at the 1986 mtv video music awards and winning two , best cinematography and best editing , bringing a-ha 's total to 11 nominations and eight wins . the following year , peter gabriel would earn 13 nominations and win nine awards , also for two separate videos . in successive years , even as the award categories expanded , only a few artists have approached—and none have surpassed the single-year award totals of a-ha and gabriel . a-ha 's american success culminated in their 1986 grammy nomination in the best new artist category , which was eventually won by sade . '' the sun always shines on tv '' turned out to be a-ha 's last hot 100 top 40 single , and to this day in the united states , a-ha is remembered by the general public almost entirely because of '' take on me '' . as such , the band is frequently considered a one-hit wonder there , despite their two top 40 hits . in the uk , however , the story was very different : '' the sun always shines on tv '' became their only number one there . in the uk , a-ha enjoyed continued success with two more hit singles from the same album— '' train of thought '' and '' hunting high and low '' ( with another innovative video ) —and the band remained popular throughout the 1980s and early 1990s . the band 's first album , 1985 's hunting high and low , became a worldwide bestseller , spending most of october and november in the top 20 of billboard 's top 200 album chart . the album and its four hit singles garnered international recognition for a-ha . hunting high and low earned triple platinum status in the uk and reached platinum status in the us and germany , while earning gold in brazil and the netherlands . hunting high and low has sold 11 million copies worldwide . the album peaked at number 15 on the us on the billboard 200 albums chart and at number 2 on the uk albums chart ; it spent 38 weeks in the top 10 in norway , including eight weeks at number one . . golden age ( 1986–1994 ) . a-ha 's second album , scoundrel days , was released in the midst of the 1986 world tour , and represented a move towards alternative rock , as synthpop began to fall out of style . although the album received favourable reviews and had three singles become international hits , the album 's sales ( 6.4 million copies ) did not match those of its predecessor ( except for switzerland , where it is a-ha 's best-selling album ) . '' cry wolf '' would be the last a-ha single to chart on the billboard hot 100 . after the release of the album , a-ha toured in the us , its last appearance there for 20 years . the album has been certified platinum in the uk , switzerland and brazil , and has earned gold certification in germany . ned raggett of allmusic guide would later write of the album , '' the opening two songs alone make for one of the best one-two opening punches around : the tense edge of the title track , featuring one of morten harket 's soaring vocals during the chorus and a crisp , pristine punch in the music , and 'the swing of things , ' a moody , elegant number with a beautiful synth/guitar arrangement ( plus some fine drumming courtesy of studio pro michael sturgis ) and utterly lovelorn lyrical sentiments that balance on the edge of being overheated without quite going over.the '80s may be long gone , but scoundrel days makes clear that not everything was bad back then . '' in may 1988 , a-ha released their third studio album , titled stay on these roads , which matched the number-two chart peak of its two predecessors on the british album charts . stay on these roads has been certified platinum in brazil and france , and gold in switzerland , germany , the uk , and the netherlands . the album includes the title-track theme song to the james bond film the living daylights . the version that appears on their album is a re-recording of the film version and single . the band has said that they are particularly proud of the title track , and all three members contributed to its writing . '' stay on these roads '' and '' the living daylights '' would remain part of their live set throughout the rest of the band 's history . after the release of the album , the band went on a 74-city world tour . the album has sold more than 4.2 million copies worldwide . east of the sun , west of the moon featured a cover version of the everly brothers ' 1963 single , '' crying in the rain '' . in the late 1980s and early 1990s , a-ha were very popular in south america , especially in brazil , where the band sold out some of the largest stadiums in the world . at the rock in rio festival in january 1991 , a-ha shocked the international entertainment press by drawing an audience of 198,000 at maracanã stadium for their top-billed evening concert—a guinness world record for biggest rock concert attendance . in contrast , the other performers ( george michael , prince , and guns n ' roses ) each drew less than a third of that audience , 60,000 each . in a 2009 interview from cody eide in musicweek , celebrating a-ha 's up and coming 25-year anniversary , the band members revealed that the record-breaking concert and the lack of media attention they received were a devastating blow to the band . the 1991 rock in rio festival , which should have been the band 's crowning achievement , was instead a moment of crushing disappointment . '' mtv interviewed everybody except us '' , remembers waaktaar-savoy . '' they were all calling their bosses and saying , 'we must cover a-ha ; it 's the only night that has sold out . ' but they were n't allowed to . '' '' i felt very alienated , '' says furuholmen . '' it made us feel hopeless . we played to the biggest crowd in the world , and they ignored it . '' east of the sun , west of the moon was certified gold in switzerland , brazil , and germany and silver in the uk . steven mcdonald of allmusic said of their fourth album , '' this is a nicely crafted collection of songs , performed and sung beautifully , with lots of echoes and suggestions tucked into the music . while not an album one can discuss at length , it 's an album that 's a pleasure to listen to . '' the album sold 3.2 million copies worldwide . their last album before their hiatus was memorial beach , in 1993 . relative to previous releases , the album was a commercial disappointment . the only single from the album to chart officially outside of norway was '' dark is the night '' , which peaked at number 19 in the united kingdom . memorial beach is notably the last official american release by a-ha to date , although their material has continued to have limited availability there as imports . despite the commercial reception , q magazine listed the album as one of the 50 best albums of 1993 . the following february , a-ha performed two concerts during the 1994 winter olympics in lillehammer , norway , followed by tours of south africa and norway . a-ha were also chosen to compose the official song for the winter paralympic games in lillehammer , which they entitled '' shapes that go together '' . in 1994 , the band unofficially entered a hiatus , and band members then focused on solo projects . . first comeback ( 1998–2007 ) . the band was invited to perform at the nobel peace prize concert in 1998 . paul wrote '' summer moved on '' especially for this performance . interview on '' a-ha live at valhall homecoming '' dvd , 2001 they also performed '' the sun always shines on tv '' . this performance was a-ha 's comeback into the world of music , yet the band 's set was controversially omitted from a programme of highlights of that concert that was televised in the uk , and even more controversially in the us by fox . nevertheless , the band returned to the studio . those recording sessions resulted in 2000 's minor earth major sky , an international tour , and a webcast performance of the band opening the new vallhall arena in oslo on 24 and 25 march 2001 . news item announcing the webcast . a-ha 's video for '' i wish i cared '' was one of the first fully web-based animated flash music videos to be made available . ( the first was duran duran 's flash video for the 2000 song '' someone else not me '' . the album reached platinum status , with sales of 1.5 million copies , and spawned four singles : '' summer moved on '' , '' minor earth major sky '' , '' velvet '' and '' the sun never shone that day '' .
