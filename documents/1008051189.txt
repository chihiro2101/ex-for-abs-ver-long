Earthsea

setting . the world of earthsea is one of sea and islands : a vast archipelago of hundreds of islands surrounded by mostly uncharted ocean . earthsea contains no large continents , with the archipelago resembling indonesia or the philippines . the largest island , havnor , at approximately across , is about the size of great britain . the cultures of earthsea are not direct analogues of those of our world , but are literate non-industrial civilizations . technologically , earthsea is an early iron age society , with bronze used in places where iron is scarce . weapons also include the use of wood and other hard but easily crafted metals . the overall climate of earthsea is temperate , comparable to the mid-latitudes ( over a distance of about of the northern hemisphere of the earth . there is a yearly transition from warm summers to cold and snowy winters , especially in northern islands like gont and osskil . in the southern regions of earthsea it can be much warmer . most of the people of earthsea are described as having brown skin . in the archipelago '' red-brown '' skin is typical , while the people of the east reach have darker '' black-brown '' complexions . quoting a wizard of earthsea : '' he had the accent of the east reach , and was very dark of skin , not red-brown like ged and jasper and most folk of the archipelago , but black-brown . '' the people of osskil in the north are described as having lighter , sallow complexions , quoting a wizard of earthsea : '' she was a tall girl of about his own age , very sallow , almost white-skinned ; her mother , they said in the village , was from osskil or some such foreign land . her hair fell long and straight like a fall of black water . '' while the kargs of the kargad lands are '' white-skinned '' and often '' yellow-haired '' . quoting a wizard of earthsea : '' . they are a savage people , white-skinned , yellow-haired , and fierce , liking the sight of blood and the smell of burning towns . '' le guin has criticized what she describes as the general assumption in fantasy that characters should be white and the society should resemble the middle ages . magic is a central part of life in most of earthsea , with the exception of the kargish lands , where it is banned . there are weather workers on ships , fixers who repair boats and buildings , entertainers , and court sorcerers . magic is an inborn talent which can be developed with training . the most gifted are sent to the school on roke , where , if their skill and their discipline prove sufficient , they can become staff-carrying wizards . a strong theme of the stories is the connection between power and responsibility . there is often a taoism message : '' good '' wizardry tries to be in harmony with the world , while '' bad '' wizardry , such as necromancy , can lead to an upsetting of the '' balance '' and threaten catastrophe . while the dragons are more powerful , they act instinctively to preserve the balance . only humans pose a threat to it . the dry land is where the people of the archipelago and reaches of earthsea go when they die . it is a realm of shadow and dust , of eternal night where the stars are fixed in the sky , and nothing changes . the souls who live there have an empty , dreary existence , and even '' lovers pass each other in silence '' . le guin has stated that the idea of the dry land came from the '' greco-roman idea of hades ' realm , from certain images in dante alighieri 's work , and from one of rainer maria rilke 's elegies .
