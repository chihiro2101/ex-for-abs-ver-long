'' he was also a member of the augur . birley , fasti , p . 72 he died in 103 or 104 , a date based on pliny the younger writing to his friends that he was elected to the college of augurs to fill the vacancy frontinus ' death had created . . family . due to a lack of either a titulus honorarius or sepulcralis , there is no outline of frontinus ' life , the names of his parents , or of his wife . some details can be inferred from chance mentions : he is thought to be of narbonese origins , and originally of the equites . william mcdermott , '' stemmata quid faciunt ? the descendants of frontinus '' , ancient society , 7 ( 1976 ) , p . 255 from the nomenclature of the name of publius calvisius ruso julius frontinus ( consul c . 84 ) , it is likely frontinus had a sister , who was the other 's mother . ronald syme , '' p . calvisius ruso . one person or two ?

'' , p . 254 . writings . aqueducts of rome . frontinus 's chief work is de aquaeductu , in two books , an official report to the emperor on the state of the aqueducts of rome . it presents a history and description of the water-supply of rome , including the laws relating to its use and maintenance . he provides the history , sizes and discharge rates of all of the nine aqueducts of rome at the time at which he was writing at the turn of the 1st century ad : the aqua marcia , aqua appia , aqua alsietina , aqua tepula , anio vetus , anio novus , aqua virgo , aqua claudia and aqua augusta . frontinus describes the quality of water delivered by each , mainly depending on their source , be it river , lake , or spring . fraud and theft . one of the first jobs he undertook when he was appointed water commissioner was to prepare maps of the system so that he could assess their condition before undertaking their maintenance . he says that many had been neglected and were not working at their full capacity . he was especially concerned by diversion of the supply by unscrupulous farmers and tradesmen , among many others . they would insert pipes into the channel of the aqueducts to tap the supply . he , therefore , made a meticulous survey of the intake and the supply of each line , and then investigated the discrepancies . lead pipe stamps bearing the name of the owner were also used to prevent such water theft . he was well aware of the seminal work de architectura by vitruvius , which mentions aqueduct construction and maintenance published in the previous century ; frontinus refers to the possible influence of vitruvius on the plumbers . 25:1 . distribution system . distribution of the water depended in a complex way on its height entering the city , the quality of the water , and its rate of discharge . thus , poor-quality water would be sent for irrigation , gardens , or flushing , while only the best would be reserved for drinking water . intermediate-quality water would be used for the many baths and fountains . however , frontinus criticized the practice of mixing supplies from different sources , and one of his first decisions was to separate the waters from each system . maintenance . he was very concerned by leaks in the system , especially those in the underground conduits , which were difficult to locate and mend , a problem still faced by water engineers today . the aqueducts above ground needed care to ensure that the masonry was kept in good condition , especially those running on arched superstructures . it was , he said , essential to keep trees at a distance so that their roots would not damage the structures . he reviewed the existing law governing the state aqueducts , as well as the need for enforcement of those statutes . military tactics . frontinus also wrote a theoretical treatise on military science , which is lost . his extant work on military matters , the stratagems ( latin : strategemata ) , is a collection of examples of military stratagems from greek and roman history , for the use of generals . he draws on his own experience as a general in germania under domitian , but similarities between the anecdotes he records and versions of other roman authors like valerius maximus and livy suggest that he drew mainly on literary sources . the authenticity of the fourth book has been challenged . paper by rogier van der wal ( amsterdam ) to the 2010 classical association conference , cardiff one example he gives of control of river water during a siege reads : . selected editions and translations . de aquaeductu . the standard edition of the latin text of frontinus ' major work , with extensive commentary in english , is now r.h . rodgers , frontinus : de aquaeductu urbis romae ( cambridge university press , 2004 ) . rodgers has published his english translation online an english translation by charles e . bennet , edited by mary b . mcelwain , has been published in the loeb classical library . no . l174 , stratagems . de aquaeductu ( 1925 ) a translation by herschel is useful for his commentary on the engineering aspects of the de aquaeductu . other works . the latest edition of the stratagems is by r . i . ireland ( teubner , 1990 ;
