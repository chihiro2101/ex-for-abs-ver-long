Pax Britannica

history . after losing the thirteen colonies , a significant part of british america , in the american revolution , britain turned towards asia , the pacific and later africa with subsequent exploration leading to the rise of the second british empire ( 1783–1815 ) . the industrial revolution began in great britain in the late 1700s and new ideas emerged about free markets , such as adam smith 's the wealth of nations ( 1776 ) . free trade became a central principle that britain practiced by the 1840s . it played a key role in britain 's economic growth and financial dominance . darwin , p . & nbsp ; 391 . from the end of the napoleonic wars in 1815 until world war i in 1914 , the united kingdom played the role of global hegemon ( most powerful actor ) . imposition of a '' british peace '' on key maritime trade routes began in 1815 with the annexation of british ceylon ( now sri lanka ) . crawfurd , pp . & nbsp ; 191–192 : '' . for what purpose was it conquered and is it now retained ? ' we endeavoured to explain , that during the wars , in which we were lately engaged with our european enemies who occupied the coast of the island , they harassed our commerce from its ports , and therefore , in self-defence , there was a necessity for taking possession of it . '' under the british residency of the persian gulf , local arab rulers agreed to a number of treaties that formalised britain 's protection of the region . britain imposed an anti-piracy treaty , known as the general maritime treaty of 1820 , on all arab rulers in the region . by signing the perpetual maritime truce of 1853 , arab rulers gave up their right to wage war at sea in return for british protection against external threats . the global superiority of british military and commerce was aided by a divided and relatively weak continental europe , and the presence of the royal navy on all of the world 's oceans and seas . even outside its formal empire , britain controlled trade with many countries such as china , siam , and argentina . following the congress of vienna the british empire 's economic strength continued to develop through naval dominance pugh , p . & nbsp ; 83 . and diplomatic efforts to maintain a balance of power in continental europe . thackeray , p . & nbsp ; 57 . in this era , the royal navy provided services around the world that benefited other nations , such as the piracy history and blockade of africa . the slave trade act 1807 had banned the trade across the british empire , after which the royal navy established the west africa squadron and the government negotiated international treaties under which they could enforce the ban . falola , pp . & nbsp ; xxi , xxxiii-xxxiv . sea power , however , did not project on land . land wars fought between the major powers include the crimean war , the franco-austrian war , the austro-prussian war and the franco-prussian war , as well as numerous conflicts between lesser powers . the royal navy prosecuted the first opium war ( 18391842 ) and second opium war ( 18561860 ) against qing dynasty . the royal navy was superior to any other two navies in the world , combined . between 1815 and the passage of the german naval laws of 1890 and 1898 , only france was a potential naval threat . the most decisive event emerged from the anglo-egyptian war , which resulted in the british occupation of egypt for seven decades , even though the ottoman empire retained nominal ownership until 1914 . m.w . daly , ed . the cambridge history of egypt volume 2 modern egypt , from 1517 to the end of the twentieth century ( 1998 ) online historian a.j.p . taylor says that this '' was a great event ; indeed , the only real event in international relations between the battle of sedan and the defeat of russia in the russo-japanese war '' . he adds , '' all the rest were maneuvers which left the combatants at the close of the day exactly where they had started .
