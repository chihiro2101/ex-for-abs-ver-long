Battle of Copenhagen (1801)

aftermath . after fighting had ended , the danish flagship dannebrog exploded at 4:30 pm , killing 250 men . by the end of the afternoon , three more badly-damaged british ships ran aground , including elephant . the danish-norwegian ships had been partly manned by volunteers , many having little or no naval experience , and as they were not all listed after the battle , it is uncertain what the exact danish-norwegian losses were . estimates vary between 1,135 and 2,215 captured , killed or wounded . the official report by olfert fischer estimated the danish-norwegian casualties to be between 1,600 and 1,800 captured , killed or wounded . according to the official returns recorded by each british ship , and repeated in dispatches from nelson and forwarded by parker to the admiralty , british casualties were 963 killed and wounded . of the danish ships engaged in the battle , two had sunk , one had exploded , and twelve had been captured . the british could not spare men for manning prizes as they suspected that further battles were to come . they burned eleven of the captured ships , and only one , holsteen , was sailed to england with the wounded under surgeon william fergusson . clarke and mcarthur , p . 611 holsteen was then taken into service with the royal navy and renamed ( later . subsequent events . the next day , nelson landed in copenhagen to open negotiations . colonel stewart reported that '' the population showed an admixture of admiration , curiosity and displeasure '' . in a two-hour meeting with the crown prince ( who spoke english ) , nelson was able to secure an indefinite armistice . he then tried to convince first fischer ( whom he had known in the west indies ) , and then the prince , of british protection against the russians . negotiations continued by letter and on 8 april nelson returned in person with a formal agreement . the one sticking point out of the seven articles was a sixteen-week armistice to allow action against the russians . pocock , p . 239 at this point stewart claims that one of the danes turned to another and said in french that disagreement might lead to a renewal of hostilities . '' renew hostilities ! '' responded nelson , and turning to his interpreter said '' tell him that we are ready in a moment ; ready to bombard this very night ! '' hurried apologies followed ( the british fleet now occupied positions that would allow the bombardment of copenhagen ) and agreement was reached and signed the next day . pocock , pp . 239–240 the armistice was reduced to fourteen weeks , but during it armed neutrality would be suspended and the british were to have free access to copenhagen . danish prisoners were also paroled . in the final hour of negotiations , the danes found out ( but not the british ) that tsar paul had been assassinated . this made the end of the league of armed neutrality very likely and freed the danes from the fear of russian reprisals against them , allowing them to easily come to agreement . the final peace agreement was then signed on 23 october 1801 . on 12 april , parker sailed to karlskrona and on the british approach , the swedish fleet returned to the port where parker attempted to persuade them to also leave the league . pocock , p . 241 parker refused to sail into the eastern baltic and instead returned to copenhagen , where he found that news of his lack of vigour had reached london . on 5 may , he was recalled and ordered to hand his command over to nelson . nelson sailed eastwards again and , leaving six ships-of-the-line at karlskrona , he arrived at reval on 14 may to find that the ice had melted and the russian fleet had departed for kronstadt . he also found out that negotiations for ending the armed neutrality had started and so withdrew on 17 may . as a result of the battle , lord nelson was created viscount nelson of the nile . this was not to be the end of the danish-norwegian conflict with the british . in 1807 , similar circumstances led to another british attack , in the battle of copenhagen ( 1807 ) . ships involved . united kingdom . ;
