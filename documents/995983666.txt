Skåneland

etymology . the name skåneland is first recorded in print in the year 1719 . svenska akademiens ordbok : skåneland ( består ) uti af skillde och nog synlige delar af skog och slättmark . 2ra 1 : 4 ( 1719 ) . it is unclear what area is meant . later ( 1751 ) carl linnaeus uses it , meaning the province of scania . skåneland in svenska akademiens ordbok ( saob ) on the internet , and skåneland in nordisk familjebok . the modern use of the denomination as a short form for de skånska landskapen ( '' the scanian provinces '' ) , for the combined area of the provinces of blekinge , halland and scania , was launched by the swedish historian and scandinavism weibull ( 1835-1902 ) in samlingar till skånes historia ( föreningen för skånes fornminnen och historia . published1868-73 in six volumes ) in order to illuminate the common danish history of scania , blekinge , and halland . weibull used the term as a combined term for the four provinces where the scanian law had its jurisdiction , as well as the area of the archdiocese of lund until the reformation in 1536 , later the danish lutheran diocese of lund . this form of skåneland was then used in the regional historical periodical historisk tidskrift för skåneland , beginning in 1901 , published by martin 's son , lauritz weibull . swedish national encyclopedia article skånelandskapen . administration . an earlier administrative and political function of the area was to serve as a core area for one of the three provincial things that together elected the king of denmark . the first danish administrative sub-divisioning occurred as part of the centralization process , when the area became divided into administrative units called hundreds ( herreder in danish ) . the hundreds were possibly based on older , already existing units , helle , knut , ed . ( 2003 ) . the cambridge history of scandinavia . cambridge university press , 2003 . , p . 183 . but the establishment of the new form of hundreds was prompted by an increase in royal power during the high middle ages . these differed from the provincial thing areas in that they were not local communities joined under a governing assembly but top-down regional divisions established to ensure royal authority . these medieval danish hundreds were used to implement military obligations and to expedite the collection of renders due to the king in the provinces . they were first established in jutland , where they replaced previous administrative units called syssel . according to some scholars , they were introduced in skåneland possibly as early as the 11th century . sawyer , birgit and p . h . sawyer ( 1993 ) . scandinavia : from conversion to reformation , circa 800-1500 . u of minnesota press . , p . 85 . in the 13th century , a new fiscal system was introduced and the hundreds were gradually included into larger administrative units called len , with a castle serving as the administrative center . this new administrative development was a result of the increased power of the aristocracy . in each len , a noble man was put in charge , with the title lensmand . bonney , richard ( 1995 ) . economic systems and state finance . oxford university press . , p.110 . each of the four provinces of skåneland had representation in the scanian thing , which , along with the other two things of the danish state ( jutland and zealand ) , elected the danish king . the four scanian provinces were joined under the jurisdiction of the scanian law , dated 1200–1216 , damsholt , nanna .

years as a guarantee of the treaty provisions . during the second northern war ( 1655 & ndash ; 1658 ) , danish attempts to recover control of halland ended in a serious defeat administered by sweden . as a result , in the treaty of roskilde ( 1658 ) , which was largely confirmed by the treaty of copenhagen ( 1660 ) , denmark ceded the provinces of skåne , blekinge and halland ( i.e . , skåneland ) . vilhelm moberg ( 1898–1973 ) in min svenska historia ii ( norstedts . 1971 ) provides a thoughtful discussion of the atrocities which were committed by both sides in the struggle over the border provinces , and identified them as the source of propaganda to inflame people passions to continue the struggle . these lopsided representations were incorporated into history text books on the respective sides . as an example , moberg compares the history texts he grew up with in sweden which represented the swedish soldier as ever pure and honorable to a letter written by gustavus adolphus celebrating the 24 & nbsp ; scanian parishes he had helped level by fire , with the troops encouraged to rape and murder the population at will , behavior that may well have been mirrored equally on the danish side . skåneland was a rather unpleasant place to dwell for an extended period . . assimilation with sweden . following the treaty of roskilde in 1658 – but in direct contradiction of its terms – the swedish government in 1683 demanded that the leading social groups of skåneland accept swedish customs and laws . swedish became the only language permitted in church liturgy and in schools , religious literature in danish was banned , and all appointed politicians and priests were required to be swedish . however the last danish bishop , peder winstrup ( 1605–1679 ) remained in charge of the diocese of lund until his death in 1679 . to promote further swedish assimilation , the university of lund was inaugurated in 1666 ; the inhabitants of scania were not allowed to enroll in copenhagen university until the 19th century . skånelands historia , ved ambrius , j , 1997 the population initially opposed the swedish reforms , as can be ascertained from church records and court transcripts . the swedes did encounter civil revolts in many areas , including the göinge district , in dense forest regions of northern scania . the swedish authorities resorted to extreme measures against the 17th-century rebels who were described as snapphane , a term used for raiding enemy soldiers or bandits . the punishments included the use of impalement breaking wheel , as well as the nailing of bodies to church doors . in that way , it could take four to five days before the victim died . herman lindquist ( 1995 ) . historien om sverige – storhet och fall . norstedts förlag , 2006 ( in swedish ) , sixten svensson ( 2005 ) . sanningen om snapphanelögnen .
