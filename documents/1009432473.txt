Beatrice Webb

my creed and my craft '' . beatrice webb left unfinished a planned autobiography , under the general title my creed and my craft . at her death , aged 85 , the only autobiographical work she had published was my apprenticeship ( 1926 ) . the posthumously issued our partnership ( 1948 ) covered the first two decades of her marriage to sidney webb between 1892 and 1911 and their collaboration on a variety of public issues . in the preface to the second work , our partnership by beatrice webb , 1948 , longmans , green & co : london , new york , p . vi . its editors refer to webb 's desire to describe truthfully her lifelong pursuit of a living philosophy , her changes of outlook and ideas , her growing distrust of benevolent philanthropy as a means of redeeming 'poor suffering humanity ' and her leaving of the field of abstract economic theory for the then practically unexplored paths of scientific social research . in 1926 when webb had begun to prepare the second volume , our partnership , only to be repeatedly distracted by other more pressing commitments , the book 's editors report her finding it difficult to express '' her philosophy of life , her belief in the scientific method , but its purpose guided always by religious emotion .

'' muggeridge and adam , beatrice webb : a life , 1967 , p.225 . the frustrations and disappointments of the next few years — the election of a narrow labour majority of mps in may 1929 , the great depression which began later that year , the agreement of fellow fabian ramsay macdonald , after the october 1931 election , to form and head a national government , thereby splitting the labour party — partly explain why beatrice and sidney began to look on the ussr and its leader stalin with different eyes . historians have criticised the webbs for the naive supposition that the methods they had developed in analysing and formulating social policy in britain could be applied to the soviet union . their book promoted and encouraged an uncritical view of stalin 's conduct , during agrarian centralisation in the first five year plan ( 1928–1933 ) , the creation of the gulag system , and the extensive purges of the 1930s . see , e.g . , robert conquest , the great terror ( 1968 and subsequent editions ) . trotskyist historian al richardson later described their 1935 account of the ussr as '' pure soviet propaganda at its most mendacious '' . al richardson , '' introduction '' to c . l . r . james , world revolution 1917–1936 : the rise and fall of the communist international . humanities press , 1937 there also seemed to be a conscious element of deception . in the third edition of soviet communism : a new civilisation ( 1941 ) , for instance , the webbs voiced the opinion that in 1937 '' strenuous efforts had been made , both in the trade union organisation and in the communist party , to cut out the dead wood '' . archie brown , the rise and fall of communism ( 2009 ) , p . 122 . this phrase was used to reassure a wider public about the grotesque accusations against former leading bolsheviks . in her diaries beatrice did not hide her disquiet , at the opening of the moscow trials in the summer of 1936 , see diary entry - 28 august 1936 , pp . 330-336 of archived typescripts . and after the conviction of nikolai bukharin in march 1938 . diary entry - 8 march 1938 , pp . 36-37 of archived typescripts . soviet communism : a new civilization ? — in later editions the question mark was dropped , as was any public doubt the webbs might have about the nature of the ussr — has since been roundly condemned . in the preface to an anthology of left book club publications , paul laity , left book club anthology weidenfeld and nicolson , 2001 ( p . xvii ) for instance , british historian a . j . p . taylor is quoted as calling soviet communism : a new civilization '' the most preposterous book ever written about russia '' . in the early 1930s malcolm muggeridge , one of beatrice 's own family by marriage , and himself the son of a fabian , told her in no uncertain terms of his horrified disapproval of the soviet system . she was among those listed in the german-compiled '' black book '' . invasion , 1940 : the nazi invasion plan for britain , little brown book group by walter schellenberg , page 259 . racism . ivan maisky , the soviet union 's ambassador to the united kingdom during much of the second world war , was friendly with webb . in a conversation with webb on 10 october 1939 , maisky quoted her as stating '' churchill is not a true englishman , you know . he has negro blood . you can tell even from his appearance .

( his daughter peggy went on to marry nana joe appiah , an african statesman and tribal chieftain who served as something of a founding father of the republic of ghana . ) margaret , yet another potter sister , married the liberal politician henry hobhouse , making beatrice webb an aunt of peace activist stephen henry hobhouse and of liberal politician arthur hobhouse . hochschild , adam , to end all wars : a story of loyalty and rebellion , 1914-1918 , boston : houghton mifflin harcourt , 2011 , p . 277 , . a dissonant voice entered the family after katherine dobbs , the daughter of beatrice 's youngest sister rosalind , married the journalist malcolm muggeridge . in the early 1930s the young couple moved to moscow , full of enthusiasm for the new soviet system . muggeridge 's experience of reporting from the soviet union for the manchester guardian , however , made him highly critical of the webbs ' optimistic views of the soviet union . see malcolm muggeridge , chronicles of wasted time : pt 1 , the green stick , london : fontana ( pbk ) , 1981 . chapter 5 , 'who whom ? ' , pp . 285-299 . also his winter in moscow ( 1934 ) . on 29 march 1933 beatrice referred in her diary to '' malcolm 's curiously hysterical denunciation of the ussr and all its works in a letter to me . '' the diaries of beatrice web ( abridged , 2000 ) , p . 514 . the following day she noted that the guardian had printed '' another account of famine in russia , which certainly bears out malcolm 's reports '' . the diaries of beatrice webb ( abridged , 2000 ) , p . 514 . yet , wrote muggeridge , beatrice '' went on wanting to see kitty and me '' . on their last visit beatrice showed her niece 's husband a portrait of lenin : '' she had set the picture up as though it were a velazquez , with special lighting coming from below '' . malcolm muggeridge , chronicles of wasted time : pt 1 , the green stick , london : fontana ( pbk ) , 1981 . chapter 4 , 'the pursuit of righteousness ' , p . 165 . . death and legacy . when beatrice webb died in 1943 , she was cremated at woking crematorium . the casket containing her ashes was buried in the garden of their house in passfield corner , as she had requested . lord passfield 's ashes were also buried there when he died four years later . shortly afterwards , the nonagenarian george bernard shaw launched an ultimately successful petition to have the remains of both moved to westminster abbey . they now lie buried in the nave of the abbey , close to the ashes of their labour party colleagues clement attlee and ernest bevin . beatrice did not live to see the welfare state set up by the attlee ministry . it was an enduring monument to her research and campaigning , before and after she married sidney webb . first outlined in the minority report ( poor law ) of 1909 , it would remain substantially intact until the 1980s . it is not certain that beatrice webb would have approved of the manner of its implementation and future management . as her niece kitty commented : kitty muggeridge & ruth adams , beatrice webb : a life , 1858-1943 , london : secker & warburg , 1967 , p . 177 . . although it was beatrice herself who put the 20th-century zeitgeist into its most concrete form , in the welfare state , something in her remained sturdily victorian to the very end . '' what has to be aimed at is not this or that improvement in material circumstances or physical comfort but an improvement in personal character , '' she wrote . she believed that citizens who were given benefits by the community ought to make an effort to improve themselves , or at least submit themselves to those who would improve them . . archives . beatrice webb 's papers , including her diaries , form part of the passfield archive at the london school of economics . the webb diaries are now digitised and available online at the lse 's digital library . posts about beatrice webb regularly appear in the lse archives blog , out of the box . writings . for a comprehensive bibliography , see webbs on the web , hosted by the london school of economics . works by beatrice webb . the co-operative movement in great britain ( 1891 ) women and the factory acts ( 1896 ) the abolition of the poor law ( 1918 ) wages of men and women : should they be equal ?
