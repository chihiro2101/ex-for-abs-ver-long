Natural experiment

history . one of the best-known early natural experiments was the 1854 broad street cholera outbreak in london , england . on 31 august 1854 , a major outbreak of cholera struck soho . over the next three days , 127 people near broad street died . by the end of the outbreak 616 people died . the physician john snow identified the source of the outbreak as the nearest public water pump , using a map of deaths and illness that revealed a cluster of cases around the pump . in this example , snow discovered a strong association between the use of the water from the pump , and deaths and illnesses due to cholera . snow found that the southwark and vauxhall waterworks company , which supplied water to districts with high attack rates , obtained the water from the thames downstream from where raw sewage was discharged into the river . by contrast , districts that were supplied water by the lambeth waterworks company , which obtained water upstream from the points of sewage discharge , had low attack rates . given the near-haphazard patchwork development of the water supply in mid-nineteenth century london , snow viewed the developments as '' an experiment.on the grandest scale .

( 2013 ) . natural experiments in econometrics . youtube video angrist capitalized on the approximate random assignment of the draft lottery ( 1969 ) , and used it as an instrumental variable associated with eligibility ( or non-eligibility ) for military service . because many factors might predict whether someone serves in the military , the draft lottery frames a natural experiment whereby those drafted into the military can be compared against those not drafted because the two groups should not differ substantially prior to military service . angrist found that the earnings of veterans were , on average , about 15 percent less than the earnings of non-veterans . industrial melanism . with the industrial revolution in the nineteenth century , many species of moth , including the well-studied peppered moth , responded to the atmospheric pollution of sulphur dioxide and soot around cities with industrial melanism , a dramatic increase in the frequency of dark forms over the formerly abundant pale , speckled forms . in the twentieth century , as regulation improved and pollution fell , providing the conditions for a large-scale natural experiment , the trend towards industrial melanism was reversed , and melanic forms quickly became scarce . the effect led the evolutionary biologists l . m . cook and j . r . g . turner to conclude that '' natural selection is the only credible explanation for the overall decline '' . . see also . common garden experiment . references .
