in the secondary department of paeroa education for about 18 months , starting in february 1955 , but resigned in july 1956 to become a full-time writer . his first published novel was the big season ( 1962 ) , a novel about a rugby player who becomes interested in a burglar and the burglar 's girlfriend . it had themes of violence and tension , and was described by the new zealand herald as '' not always pleasant , but certainly forceful and sincere '' . gee himself was a keen rugby player and the games in the novel were inspired by his own experiences . in 1964 , gee was the sixth recipient of the robert burns fellowship at the university of otago , one of new zealand 's most prestigious literary awards . during this fellowship he wrote his second novel , a special flower ( 1965 ) . after the fellowship he trained as a librarian and in the 1960s and 1970s worked at the alexander turnbull library , the napier library and several libraries in auckland . his third novel , in my father 's den , a mystery novel , was published in 1972 . this novel was later adapted into the critically acclaimed film of the same name by director brad mcgann in 2004 . gee followed this novel with a collection of short stories , a glorious morning , comrade ( 1974 ) , which won the prize for fiction at the 1976 new zealand book awards , and a further novel games of choice ( 1976 ) . . plumb and children 's fiction . gee 's novel plumb , published in 1978 , is his best-known work for adults , and is considered one of the best novels ever written in new zealand . in 2018 , fifty new zealand literary experts voted it to be the best novel of the last fifty years . gee has described it as his '' grandfather novel '' , with the character george plumb closely based on his mother 's father james chapple , particularly his early life and his trials for heresy and sedition . it won the james tait black memorial prize in the uk , and the top prize for fiction at both the ockham new zealand book awards and the new zealand book awards in 1979 . the novel and its two sequels , meg ( 1981 ) and sole survivor ( 1983 ) , explore the impacts of history , politics and religion on one family from the perspectives of different members . at this time gee also published his first children 's novel , under the mountain ( 1979 ) , a science fiction story set in auckland , new zealand , about 11-year-old twins who discover aliens under volcanic lake pupuke . it has remained in print since it was published and is considered a new zealand classic . it has been adapted into a 1981 television miniseries , a 2009 film and a stage show . it was followed by other children 's books , most notably the science fiction trilogy beginning with the halfmen of o ( 1982 ) , which won the aim children 's book awards book of the year award in 1983 . in order to improve his income , gee began working in television writing , including writing for 11 episodes of soap opera close to home and episodes of police drama mortimer 's patch . two of his children 's books , the fire-raiser ( 1986 ) and the champion ( 1989 ) originated as television projects . he also wrote two adult novels set in nelson , new zealand : prowlers ( 1987 ) and the burning boy ( 1990 ) . . later career and legacy . the publication of gee 's tenth novel , going west ( 1992 ) , cemented his reputation as one of the best writers in new zealand . it is the most autobiographical of gee 's fictional novels , and the fictional setting is indistinguishable from henderson , auckland , where gee grew up . the novel was the inspiration for the going west writers ' festival , auckland 's first literary festival , which has been held since 1996 . gee was the 1992 recipient of the katherine mansfield menton fellowship , a literary fellowship that enables the recipient to work in menton , france , for part of the year , where katherine mansfield herself lived and worked in the early 20th century . during his time in menton , gee wrote the novel crime story , which was published in 1994 . a decade later it was adapted by larry parr into the 2004 film fracture . the film was praised by christchurch newspaper the press as '' competent , confident and complex '' . the fat man ( 1994 ) won the aim children 's book of the year award and the esther glen award . it was controversial for its content and portrayal of violence , with gee himself describing it as a '' psychological thriller for children '' . in 2018 gee published his memoir memory pieces . the memoir is in three parts : the first about his parents ' lives , the second about his own childhood and adolescent years , and the third about his wife . he said it is '' almost certainly '' going to be his last book . it was shortlisted for the royal society te apārangi award for general non-fiction at the 2019 ockham new zealand book awards . the oxford companion to new zealand literature ( 2006 ) said that each of gee 's novels '' bountifully gives us a rich vision of some region and aspect of new zealand life , and of human life in general . yet there is always an awareness of living at the edge of an abyss : one false move and we shall leave this abundance for nothingness . '' . personal life . gee had a seven-year relationship with hera smith , with whom he had a son , nigel , in september 1959 . they separated in the 1960s . gee married his wife margareta in 1970 , having met in 1966 at the alexander turnbull library where she worked . they have two adult daughters together , abigail and emily . abigail works as an animator , and emily is a writer who has published fantasy and historical novels . gee said in 2018 that meeting margareta changed his life : '' i was 38 when we got together and was drifting and wasting my time and only pretending to be a writer . she brought stability of every kind into my life – and as i point out in running on the stairs , two novels and a handful of stories before meeting her , more than 30 novels since .
