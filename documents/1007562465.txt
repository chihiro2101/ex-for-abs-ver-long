'' i hereby declare that on february 8th , 1916 , tristan tzara discovered the word dada . i was present with my twelve children , and i wore a brioche in my left nostril . i am convinced that this word has no importance and that only imbeciles and spanish professors can be interested in dates . what interests us is the dada spirit and we were all dada before the existence of dada . '' from arp 's 'declaration ' , october 1921 '' art is fruit growing out of man like the fruit out of a plant like the child out of the mother . reason tells man to stand above nature and to be the measure of all things . through reason man became a tragic and ugly figure . '' c . 1932 '' these paintings , these sculptures – these objects – should remain anonymous , in the great workshop of nature , like the clouds , the mountains , the seas , the animals , and man himself . yes ! man should go back to nature ! artists should work together like the artists of the middle ages . '' c . 1941–42 '' sculpture should walk on the tips of its toes , unostentatious , unpretentious , and light as the spoor of an animal in snow . art should melt into and even merge with nature itself . this is obviously contrary to painting and sculpture based on nature . by so doing , art will rid itself more and more of self-centredness , virtuosity and absurdity .
