Martin Carthy

early life . he was born in hatfield , hertfordshire , england , and grew up in hampstead , north london . his mother was an active socialist and his father , from a family of thames lightermen , went to grammar school and became a trade unionist and a councillor for stepney at the age of 21 . martin 's father had played fiddle and guitar as a young man but martin was unaware of this connection to his folk music heritage until much later in life . his vocal and musical training began when he became a chorister at the savoy chapel . he picked up his father 's old guitar for the first time after hearing '' rock island line '' by lonnie donegan . he has cited his first major folk music influences as big bill broonzy and the syncopated guitar style of elizabeth cotten . carthy performed his first professional engagement at the age of 16 at the loft , a coffee bar in primrose gardens . interview on bbc radio 4 's desert island discs broadcast 13 january 2013 although his father wanted him to go to university to study classics , carthy left school at 17 and worked behind the scenes as a prompter at the open-air theatre in regent 's park , then as an assistant stage manager ( asm ) on a tour of the merry widow , and then at theatre in the round in scarborough . martin carthy .

his style is marked by the use of alternative tunings ( notably cgcdga ) , and a strongly percussive picking style that emphasises the melody . in 1964 , carthy joined marian mackenzie , ralph trainer and leon rosselson in the group the three city four . the group concentrated on contemporary songs , including some of rosselson 's own , and made two albums – the first for decca and a second , '' smoke and dust ( where the heart should have been ) '' , for cbs . the 1965 eponymous debut the three city four featured carthy singing lead vocals on two tracks – sydney carter 's '' telephone song '' and rosselson 's own '' history lesson '' . roy bailey would replace carthy when he later left the group . carthy 's debut solo album , martin carthy , was released in 1965 , and also featured dave swarbrick playing fiddle on some tracks , although he was not mentioned in the album 's sleeve notes . carthy 's arrangement of the traditional ballad '' scarborough fair '' was adapted , without acknowledgement , by paul simon on the simon and garfunkel album recording parsley , sage , rosemary and thyme in 1966 . this caused a rift between the pair which was not resolved until simon invited carthy to sing the song with him on-stage at the hammersmith apollo in 2000 . . musical collaborations . he has also been involved with many musical collaborations . he has sung with the watersons since 1972 ; was twice a member of british folk rock group steeleye span ; was a member of the albion country band 1973 line-up , with members from the fairport convention family and john kirkpatrick , that recorded the battle of the field album ; and was part of the innovative brass monkey ensemble , which mixed a range of brass instruments with carthy 's guitar and mandolin and john kirkpatrick 's accordion , melodeon and concertina . carthy was also a member of the imagined village for all three of their albums 2007–2012 . for many years carthy enjoyed a creative partnership with fiddle player dave swarbrick ; more recently , waterson–carthy has provided the forum for his successful musical partnership with wife norma waterson and their daughter eliza carthy . awards . in june 1998 , he was appointed an mbe in the queen 's birthday honours . he was named folk singer of the year at the bbc radio 2 folk awards in 2002 , and again in 2005 when he also won the award for best traditional track for famous flower of serving-men . in the 2007 folk awards martin carthy and dave swarbrick won best duo . in 2008 he was made an honorary fellow of the university of central lancashire . in 2014 he was awarded the lifetime achievement award at the bbc radio 2 folk awards . discography . original / studio albums ( solo or with dave swarbrick ) . martin carthy ( 1965 ) with dave swarbrick second album ( 1966 ) with dave swarbrick byker hill ( 1967 ) with dave swarbrick but two came by ( 1968 ) with dave swarbrick prince heathen ( 1969 ) with dave swarbrick landfall ( 1971 ) shearwater ( 1972 . reissued in 2005 with three extra tracks ) sweet wivelsfield ( 1974 ) crown of horn ( 1976 ) because it 's there ( 1979 ) out of the cut ( 1982 ) right of passage ( 1988 ) life and limb ( 1990 ) with dave swarbrick skin and bone ( 1992 ) with dave swarbrick signs of life ( 1998 ) waiting for angels ( 2004 ) straws in the wind ( 2006 ) with dave swarbrick . compilations and live albums . this is . martin carthy : the bonny black hare and other songs ( 1971 ) with dave swarbrick six tracks from byker hill and six tracks from but two came by selections ( 1971 ) with dave swarbrick six tracks from byker hill ;
