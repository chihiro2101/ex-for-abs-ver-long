Privy Council of Sweden

middle ages . during the reign of magnus iii between 1275 and 1290 the meetings of the council became a permanent institution having the offices of steward , constable and chancellor . particularly from the reign of king gustav vasa , with his efforts of creating a centralised state , the members of the council gradually became more of courtiers and state officials rather than the semi-autonomous warlords they once were . early modern sweden . following the change of policies upon the death of gustav ii adolf in battle of lützen ( 1632 ) , the 1634 instrument of government written by chancellor axel oxenstierna laid the foundation for the administration of modern sweden . for instance , the roots of the present-day administrative subdivision into counties is a legacy from this time . from 1634 , the council was headed by the five great officers of the realm , each leading a branch of the state administration : lord high steward ( or lord high justiciar ) ( swedish : riksdrots ) lord high constable ( swedish : riksmarsk ) lord high admiral ( swedish : riksamiral ) lord high chancellor ( swedish : rikskansler ) lord high treasurer ( swedish : riksskattmästare ) . parliamentarism vs . absolute monarchy . the councillors had the highest position in the kingdom after the royal family and were styled '' the king 's cousins '' . from around 1672 , the year of the coming of age of charles xi , the council was assembled less and less frequently and eventually the king ruled autocracy , using an ad hoc group of trusted relations and advisors to discuss a particular matter or group of matters . the scanian war ( 1674–1679 ) gave the king the opportunity to establish – with the approval of the estates – an absolute monarchy along the lines of renaissance absolutism . council , parliament , local government , legal system , church of sweden , all were brought within the power of the king and his secretaries . this was the culmination of a long power-struggle between the kings and the aristocracy . the first of the riksdag acts ratifying the change of system was a declaration that the king was not bound by the 1634 constitution , which no king or queen had ever consented to freely . the councillors were now titles royal councillors , being appointed and dismissed at the king 's pleasure . in 1713 , the son and successor of charles xi , charles xii , issued a new working order for the chancellery to enable him to conduct government from the battle-field , but his sudden death at the siege of fredricshald in norway in 1718 provided the opportunity for the parliament ( riksdag of the estates ) to write a new constitution in 1719 and 1721 , that gave sweden half a century of first renewed conciliatory , and then parliamentary government . the first estate , the nobility , dominated both the parliament and the council . the council now had 16 members and was chaired by the king . each councillor had one vote , while the king , as chairman , had two . the council was the government of the country , but also the supreme judicial authority . from 1738 the estates could remove councillors to create a majority corresponding to that of the estates , the estates also appointing the president of the chancellery ( the prime minister ) , along party lines . the freedom of the press act ( 1766 ) was also passed during this period . this age of liberty lasted until the bloodless coup d'état of king gustav iii in 1772 , which restored royal sovereignty under the guise of the 1634 instrument of government . in 1789 , by the act of union and security , an amendment charter to the constitution , the exclusive right of the nobility to high offices was abolished and the estates of the burghers and the peasants also received these privileges - a step towards modern democracy . aristocratic control of state organs ceased , as among other things the privy council was able to be abolished altogether by the act , although the then councillors retained their titles for life . the council 's judicial function devolved on the king 's supreme court composed of an equal number of noble and non-noble members . in the 1789 constitutional amendment gustav iii , having desired to abolish the constitutional power of the council ( a pesky limitation to royal rule of the executive branch , in his view ) , had instead received the right to determine the number of councillors . he decided to have zero of them , instead he created the office of rikets allmänna ärendens beredning , which was a predecessor to the council of state . the loss of the finnish war in 1809 prompted a military coup which removed gustav iv adolf , replacing the gustavian era with a new dynasty and a new constitution restoring initiative to the estates . developments in 1809 and beyond . on 6 june 1809 , a new constitution was adopted , and while the king still appointed the members of the council , once again called the council of state , the legislative powers were once again shared with the riksdag of the estates . the new council had nine members ; the leading members being the minister of state for justice and the minister of state for foreign affairs . the departmental reform of 1840 created seven ministries headed by a minister , and in 1866 the four estates were abolished and the new bicameral riksdag was constituted . in 1917 , as the outcome of the courtyard crisis , the parliamentary system was firmly established in sweden , and the king could no longer independently appoint cabinet members without taking the will of the riksdag into account . list of lords high chancellor and presidents of the chancellery from the advent of absolutism in 1680 to 1809 . count bengt oxenstierna ( june 1680 – 1685 ; acting ) ( 1685 – 12 july 1702 ) count nils gyldenstolpe ( 12 july 1702 – december 1705 ; acting ) ( december 1705 – 4 may 1709 ) count arvid horn ( 21 march 1710 – 10 april 1719 ) count gustaf cronhielm ( 15 may 1719 – 12 december 1719 ) count johan august meijerfeldt ( 12 december 1719 – 22 april 1720 ; acting ) count arvid horn ( 22 april 1720 – 18 december 1738 ) count gustaf bonde ( 18 december 1738 – 16 april 1739 ; acting ) count carl gyllenborg ( 16 april 1739 – 9 december 1746 ) count carl gustaf tessin ( 9 december 1746 – 5 december 1747 ; acting ) ( 5 december 1747 – march 1752 ) count andreas johan von höpken ( 17 march 1752 – 5 february 1761 ) count claes ekeblad ( 10 april 1761 – 12 august 1765 ) count carl gustaf löwenhielm ( 9 september 1765 – 7 march 1768 ) baron fredrik von friesendorff ( 7 march 1768 – 30 may 1769 ; acting ) count claes ekeblad ( 30 may 1769 – 9 october 1771 ) count ulrik scheffer ( 9 october 1771 – 22 april 1772 ; acting ) count joachim von düben ( 22 april 1772 – 22 august 1772 ) count ulrik scheffer ( 23 august 1772 – 5 june 1783 ) count gustaf philip creutz ( 5 june 1783 – 30 october 1785 ) baron malte ramel ( 30 october 1785 – may 1786 ) baron emanuel de geer ( may 1786 – 13 june 1787 ) count johan gabriel oxenstierna ( may 1786 – 14 november 1789 ) count karl wilhelm von düben ( 1788 – 8 november 1790 ) baron evert wilhelm taube ( 29 march 1792 – 1792 ) baron fredrik wilhelm von ehrenheim ( 28 may 1801 – 28 march 1809 ) count lars von engeström ( may 1809 – june 1809 ) . see also . history of sweden monarchy of sweden riksdag of the estates government of sweden . references .
