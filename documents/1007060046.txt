' like a battered wife , they never think to ask the really relevant questions : who said we needed a husband , or a husband-state , at all ? '' during this time johnson also declared herself a lesbian and began a relationship with a woman . after ending that relationship , she wrote in the ship that sailed into the living room that even relationships between female couples are a dangerous patriarchal trap , because '' two is the ideal number for inequality , for sadism , for the reproduction of patriarchy '' , and that relationships are '' slave ships '' ( a concept from which she derived the title of the book ) . '' nearly four years after i began my rebellion against relation/sex/slave ships , '' she wrote , '' experience and my wise old woman are telling me that sex as we know it is a patriarchal construct and has no rightful , natural place in our lives , no authentic function or ways . synonymous with hierarchy/control , sex is engineered as part of the siege against our wholeness and power . '' johnson , sonia . the ship that sailed into the living room : sex and intimacy reconsidered . wildfire books , september 1991 . in the sisterwitch conspiracy , johnson imagines a world in which men do not exist at all , inspired by her belief that '' as long as men were on the planet , neither peace nor justice would ever be possible .
