early life . brown was born in texas city , texas . as a child he loved music and received classical music training on the piano . dahl , bill . '' biography '' . allmusic.com . retrieved 10 november 2015 he graduated from central high school in galveston , texas , in 1939 and prairie view a & m college in 1942 with a degree in chemistry . he then became a chemistry teacher at george washington carver high school in baytown , texas , a mustard gas worker at the pine bluff arsenal at pine bluff , arkansas , and an apprentice electrician at a shipyard in richmond , california , before settling in los angeles in 1943 . . career . early success with johnny moore . in los angeles , an influx of african americans from the south during world war ii created an integrated nightclub scene in which black performers tended to minimize the rougher blues elements of their style . the blues-club style of a light rhythm bass and right-hand tinkling of the piano and smooth vocals became popular , epitomized by the jazz piano of nat king cole . when cole left los angeles to perform nationally , his place was taken by johnny moore 's three blazers , featuring brown 's gentle piano and vocals . the three blazers signed with exclusive records , and their 1945 recording of '' drifting blues '' , with brown on piano and vocals , stayed on the u.s . billboard r & b chart for six months , putting brown at the forefront of a musical evolution that changed american musical performance . brown led the group in a series of further hits for aladdin over the next three years , including '' new orleans blues '' and the original version of '' merry christmas baby '' ( both in 1947 ) and '' more than you know '' ( 1948 ) . brown 's style dominated the influential southern california club scene on central avenue , in los angeles , during that period . he influenced such performers as floyd dixon , cecil gant , ivory joe hunter , percy mayfield , johnny ace and ray charles . . solo success . in the late 1940s , a rising demand for blues was driven by a growing audience among white teenagers in the south , which quickly spread north and west . blues singers such as louis jordan , wynonie harris and roy brown were getting much of the attention , but what writer charles keil dubs '' the postwar texas clean-up movement in blues '' was also beginning to have an influence , driven by blues artists such as t-bone walker , amos milburn and brown . their singing was lighter and more relaxed , and they worked with bands and combos that had saxophone sections and played from arrangements . brown left the three blazers in 1948 and formed his own trio with eddie williams ( bass ) and charles norris ( guitar ) . he signed with aladdin records and had immediate success with '' get yourself another fool '' and then had one of his biggest hits , '' trouble blues '' , in 1949 , which stayed at number one on the billboard r & b chart for 15 weeks in the summer of that year . he followed with '' in the evening when the sun goes down '' , '' homesick blues '' , and '' my baby 's gone '' , before having another r & b chart-topping hit with '' black night '' , which stayed at number one for 14 weeks from march to june 1951 . his final hit for several years was '' hard times '' in 1951 . brown 's approach was too mellow to survive the transition to the harsher rhythms of rock and roll , despite his recording in cosimo matassa 's new orleans studio in 1956 , and he faded from national attention . though he was unable to compete with the more aggressive sound that was increasing in popularity , he had a small , devoted audience , and his songs were covered by the likes of john lee hooker and lowell fulson . his '' please come home for christmas '' , a hit for king records in 1960 , remained seasonally popular . '' please come home for christmas '' had sold over one million copies by 1968 and was awarded a gold disc in that year . in the 1960s brown recorded two albums for mainstream records . later career . in the 1980s brown made a series of appearances at the new york city nightclub tramps . as a result of these appearances he signed a recording contract with blue side records and recorded one more for the road in three days . blue side records closed soon after , but distribution of its records was picked up by alligator records . soon after the success of one more for the road , bonnie raitt helped usher in a comeback tour for brown . he began a recording and performing career again , under the musical direction of the guitarist danny caron , to greater success than he had achieved since the 1950s . other members of charles 's touring ensemble included clifford solomon on tenor saxophone , ruth davies on bass and gaylord birch on drums . several records received grammy award nominations . in the 1980s brown toured widely as the opening act for raitt . tributes and awards . brown was inducted into the blues hall of fame in 1996 and was inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 1999 . he was a recipient of a 1997 national heritage fellowship awarded by the national endowment for the arts , which is the highest honor in the folk and traditional arts in the united states . brown was nominated for the grammy award for best traditional blues album three times : in 1991 for all my life , 1992 for someone to love and 1995 for charles brown 's cool christmas blues . between 1987 and 2005 , he was nominated for seventeen blues music awards ( formerly known as the w . c . handy awards ) in multiple categories , with a win in the blues instrumentalist : piano/keyboard category in 1991 , and wins in the male blues vocalist category in 1993 and 1995 . . death . brown died of heart failure in 1999 in oakland , california , and was interred at inglewood park cemetery , in inglewood , california . . discography . releases by brown with johnny moore 's three blazers are located in that discography . as leader . drifting blues ( score , 1957 ) sings christmas songs ( king , 1961 ) the great charles brown that will grip your heart ( king , 1963 ) boss of the blues ( mainstream , 1964 ) ballads my way ( mainstream , 1965 ) legend !
