United States Air Force Thunderbirds

overview . the thunderbirds squadron is a named usaf squadron , meaning it does not carry a numerical designation . it is also one of the oldest squadrons in the air force , its origins dating to the organization of the 30th aero squadron , formed at kelly field , texas , on 13 june 1917 . officers serve a two-year assignment with the squadron , while enlisted personnel serve three to four years . as the squadron performs no more than 88 air demonstrations each year , replacements must be trained for about half of the team each year , in order to provide a constant mix of experience . in addition to their air demonstration responsibilities , the thunderbirds are part of the usaf combat force and if required , can be rapidly integrated into an operational fighter unit . ^ '' gao : april 2007 : tactical aircraft : dod needs a joint and integrated investment strategy '' . gao.gov . retrieved 30 august 2010 . since 15 february 1974 the thunderbirds have been a component of the 57th wing at nellis afb . since 1953 , they have flown in front of more than 300 million people . . f-16 fighting falcon . the thunderbirds perform aerial demonstrations in the f-16c fighting falcon , and they also fly two f-16d twin-seat trainers . the f-16 has been the demonstration aircraft for the thunderbirds since the 1983 season . in january 1982 , four members of the squadron were killed in what became known as the '' diamond crash '' of t-38 talon aircraft which the squadron had flown since 1974 . partially as a result of that accident , the squadron switched to the f-16a , and sat out the 1982 airshow season and spent that year retraining and transitioning over to the new aircraft to ready themselves for the 1983 season . the f-16 , however , had been considered for transition prior to the accident . in rebuilding the thunderbird team , the air force recruited previous thunderbird pilots , qualified each in the f-16a , and had them begin by flying '' two-ship '' maneuvers , then expanded the program one airplane at a time up to the full six airplanes . beginning in june 1982 , the f-16 thunderbirds were led by major jim latham . the team continues to fly the f-16 , having switched from the f-16a to the f-16c in 1992 . only a few minor modifications differentiate a thunderbird from an operational f-16c . these include the replacement of the cannon and ammunition drum with a smoke-generating system , including its plumbing and control switches , the removal of the jet fuel starter exhaust door , and the application of the thunderbirds ' glossy red , white , and blue polyurethane paint scheme . all the modification work is performed at the maintenance depot at hill afb near ogden , utah . other than those modifications , the aircraft are taken from the standard usaf inventory as production fighters , and can be returned to an operational squadron in short order without any major modification . ; general dynamics f-16a/b fighting falcon : during the switch to the f-16a the thunderbirds acquired new block 15 aircraft which they operated from 1983 to 1991 , making the team one of the last usaf units flying the older f-16a 's before transitioning into new c 's . they also operated the two-seat f-16b during this time for training new pilots and for vip flights , these being replaced by the f-16d when the rest of the squadron transitioned to the f-16c . ; lockheed martin f-16c/d fighting falcon ( block 32 ) : the block 32h/j aircraft currently assigned to the thunderbirds were built in 1986 and 1987 , and operated by the thunderbirds from 1992 to 2008 . at their retirement , they were some of the oldest operational f-16s in the air force . ; lockheed martin f-16c/d fighting falcon ( block 52 ) : in the 2009 show season the thunderbirds transitioned to an updated version of the f-16 fighter . the block 52s have an upgraded avionics package that brings the thunderbird fleet into alignment with the rest of the worldwide f-16 fleet . additionally , the more powerful pratt & whitney f100 engine adds an additional of thrust . this in turn increases the maximum allowable gross weight for ground handling , taxi , takeoff and in-flight maneuvers by nearly 5,000 lb . support aircraft . boeing c-17 globemaster iii . demonstration routine . from the end of the runway the four-ship thunderbird team get ready to begin their takeoff roll with the words '' thunderbirds , let 's run em up ! '' being retransmitted from the team leader 's mic through the pa system for the crowd to hear . diamond : historically , as thunderbirds 1 through 4 lift off , the slot aircraft slips immediately into position behind 1 to create the signature diamond formation . thanks to the 2009 upgrade to the block 52 , the diamond now has more than enough thrust to continue to climb straight up into their first maneuver , the diamond loop . solos : thunderbird 5 takes to the air next , performing a clean low altitude aileron roll , followed by 6 who performs a split s , climbing in a near vertical maneuver , rolling over and diving back toward show center and pulling up just above the runway to exit in the opposite direction . much of the thunderbirds ' display alternates between maneuvers performed by the diamond , and those performed by the solos . they have a total of eight different formations : the diamond , delta , stinger , arrowhead , line-abreast , trail , echelon and the five card . the arrowhead involves maneuvers in tight formation with as little as fuselage to canopy separation . they perform formation loops and rolls or transitions from one formation to another . all maneuvers are performed at speeds of . the opposing solos usually perform their maneuvers just under the speed of sound , and show off the capabilities of their individual aircraft by doing maneuvers such as fast passes , slow passes , fast rolls , slow rolls , and very tight turns . some of their maneuvers include both solo aircraft at once , such as opposing passes ( passing in close proximity to each other ) and mirror formations ( two aircraft being flown back-to-back in the calypso pass or belly-to-belly ) . in mirror formations , one thunderbird must be inverted , and it is always number 5 . in fact , the number 5 on this aircraft is painted upside-down , and thus appears right-side-up for much of the routine . there is also an extra amount of humor regarding the inverted performance of thunderbird 5 : the pilots all wear tailored flight suits with their name and jet number embroidered on the left breast . the suit for the pilot of the number 5 airplane has the number sewn upside-down . nearing the end the diamond pulls straight up into the vertical to perform the signature '' bomb burst , '' where all four aircraft break off in separate directions while a solo goes straight up through the maneuver and performs aileron rolls until three miles above the ground . at the end of the routine , all six aircraft join in formation , forming the delta . one of the thunderbirds ' standing engagements is the annual commencement ceremony at the united states air force academy in colorado springs . the jets fly over falcon stadium at the precise moment the cadets throw their hats into the air at ceremony 's end . history . on 19 september 1985 , the usaf air demonstration squadron was consolidated by air force historical research agency ( afhra ) with the 30th bombardment squadron , a unit which was organized on 13 june 1917 . during its operational history , the 30th served in world war i as a training unit in france , its mission to train fighter pilots to go into combat on the western front . the squadron was almost torpedoed on its troop ship crossing the atlantic ocean . stationed at clark field in the philippines on 7 december 1941 , it was almost wiped out in the 1941 battle of the philippines . some members of the squadron fought as an infantry unit and were captured by the japanese , being subjected to the bataan death march . the squadron was withdrawn to australia , being reformed and later attacked japan as a b-29 superfortress squadron in 1945 . it was awarded nine presidential unit citations in world war ii . during the korean war , the 30th attacked north korean targets with b-29 superfortresses . present-day usaf thunderbirds carry the lineage , history , and honors of the 30th on active duty . . usaf thunderbirds history . . f-84 thunderjet/thunderstreak era . after six months training in an unofficial status , the thunderbirds were activated on 25 may 1953 as the 3600th air demonstration team at luke afb , just west of phoenix . the team had flown 26 shows by that august . the first team leader was major dick catledge ( 1953–1954 ) , and the first plane used by the unit was the straight-wing f-84 thunderjet . because the thunderjet was a single-seat fighter , a two-seat t-33 shooting star served as the narrator 's aircraft and was used as the vip/press ride aircraft . the t-33 served with the thunderbirds in this capacity in the 1950s and 1960s . the next year the thunderbirds performed their first overseas air shows , in a tour of south and central america , and added a permanent solo routine to the demonstration . broughton , jack ( 2007 ) . rupert red two : a fighter pilot 's life from thunderbolts to thunderchiefs , zenith press , , p . 196 . the first official solo pilot was lt . edwin '' lucky '' palmgren , who also served a tour in 1963–1964 as team commander/leader . in the spring of 1955 , under their second commander/leader ( september 1954 – february 1957 ) , captain jacksel m . broughton , broughton was hand-selected by catledge to replace him , and is the only captain to serve as commander/leader of the team . they moved to the swept-wing f-84f thunderstreak aircraft , in which they performed 91 air shows , and received their first assigned support aircraft , a c-119 flying boxcar . . f-100 super sabre era . the thunderbirds ' aircraft were again changed in june 1956 , to the f-100 super sabre , which gave the team supersonic capability . this switch was accompanied by a relocation of their headquarters to nellis afb , nevada on 1 june because of maintenance and logistical difficulties of basing the f-100s at luke , with their first show after the move being held on 23 june . it also signaled a shift in their performance routine—for example , the cuban eight opening routine was dropped , and emphasis was placed on low , screaming flyovers and demonstrations of takeoff performance . for a time , if the show 's sponsor permitted it , the pilots would create a sonic boom ; this ended when the faa banned supersonic flight over the continental united states . the move to nellis also resulted in the first assignment of buildings and hangar space to the team . broughton ( 2007 ) , p . 220 . this practice remained in force through the 1973 season . in 1961 , the team was compelled to discontinue the vertical bank maneuver due to an faa regulation prohibiting aerobatics that pointed the nose of the aircraft toward the crowd . the year 1962 saw the introduction of dual solo routines , and the thunderbirds went on their first european deployment in 1963 , the year after the disbanding of the '' skyblazers '' ( see below ) . the team switched to the f-105 thunderchief for the 1964 season , but were forced to re-equip with the f-100d after only six airshows due to a catastrophic structural failure of the no . 2 aircraft during a pitch-up maneuver that resulted in the death of capt gene devlin at hamilton air force base on 9 & nbsp ; may . the f-100d super sabre was retained through the 1968 season . f-4 phantom ii era . by 1967 , the thunderbirds had flown 1,000 shows . in 1969 , the squadron re-equipped with the front-line f-4e phantom , which it flew until 1973 , the only time the thunderbirds would fly jets similar to those of the blue angels as it was the standard fighter for both services in the 1960s and 1970s . t-38 talon era . due to the 1973 oil crisis , the team flew only six air shows and was grounded for some time . however , in 1974 they switched to the more economical t-38 talon . five t-38s used the same amount of fuel needed for one f-4 phantom . the switch ended the era of the black tail on the no . 4 slot plane , now regularly cleaned and shined like the others . in 1982 , the thunderbirds suffered a catastrophic loss during pre-season training on while practicing the four-plane diamond loop , the formation impacted the ground at high speed , instantly killing all four pilots : major norman l . lowry ( commander/leader ) , captain willie mays , captain joseph n . '' pete '' peterson , and captain mark melancon . the cause of the crash was determined by the usaf to be the result of a mechanical problem with the no . 1 aircraft 's control stick actuator . this resulted in insufficient back pressure by the formation leader on the t-38 control stick during the loop . visually cueing off of the lead aircraft during formation maneuvering , the wing and slot pilots disregarded their positions relative to the ground . . f-16 fighting falcon era . the team 's activities were suspended for six months pending investigation of the crashes and review of the program , then reinstituted using the general dynamics f-16 fighting falcon in 1983 , , and were upgraded to the f-16c ( now produced by lockheed martin ) in 1992 . in 1986 , the thunderbirds did a fly-by for the re-dedication of the statue of liberty in new york city . they also performed the first american military demonstration in a communist country when the team visited beijing , china , in 1987 . their 3,000th air show was performed in 1990 , and in 1991 the team went overseas to perform air shows in switzerland , poland , and hungary . the team traveled abroad again in 1996 , visiting romania , bulgaria , and slovenia . also in 1996 , the team participated in the atlanta olympics ' opening ceremonies . the united states postal service honored the air force 's 50th anniversary as a separate branch of the military in 1997 with a limited edition stamp featuring the thunderbirds . left thumb in june 2005 , the thunderbirds selected major nicole malachowski for the no . 3 position , making her the first female to hold a pilot position in the team 's 53-year history . in 2007 , during maj . malachowski 's final season as a thunderbird , the team selected its second female pilot ,

major samantha weeks . womanpilot magazine . retrieved on 7 april 2012 . thumb the 2007 european goodwill tour was the thunderbirds 's first visit to europe after the 11 september attacks . during this tour , the thunderbirds performed at their first-ever air show in ireland . despite inclement weather , more than 100,000 people attended the air show , garnering nationwide exposure by irish media . additional stops along the way included aerial demonstrations in poland , romania , bulgaria 's graf ignatievo air base , italy , france and england , where the thunderbirds participated in the royal international air tattoo , the world 's largest air show . outside of aerial demonstrations , the team participated in eight official public relations events attended by heads of state and local civic leaders . the team also conducted community outreach by meeting with needy children throughout europe . on 10–11 november 2007 , the city of las vegas and nellis afb saluted the u.s . air force , hosting the capstone event of the usaf 's 60th anniversary celebration . in 2008 , the thunderbirds remained in north america , performing both in the united states and in canada . when quebec city celebrated its 400th anniversary , the thunderbirds joined the canadian forces 's snowbirds , the british royal air force 's red arrows , and the united states navy 's blue angels in a ceremonial flight over quebec city . later in the year , the team returned to canada for two shows in abbotsford , british columbia . in 2009 the thunderbirds hired their first-ever air national guard pilot , lt . col . derek routt as thunderbird no . 7 ( operations officer ) , and the first-ever reserve pilot , maj . sean gustafson , also joined the team as thunderbird no . 4 ( slot ) . the 2009 far east tour took the team to multiple locations on the western border of the pacific rim and included performances in hawaii , australia , malaysia , guam , thailand , japan , and south korea . more than 1.2 million people saw the shows in person and more than 120 million were exposed to the shows through their national media . these are conservative estimates as one korean prime-time television show alone reached eight million . the top-rated show '' qualifications of man '' did a one-hour feature on the thunderbirds and resulted from a coordinated media pitch to the network and the republic of korea air force . in addition to the air shows , the thunderbirds personally met and spent time with more than five hundred special needs children and orphans . the entire 2013 flying season was canceled due to budget cuts resulting from the united states fiscal cliff . sequestration measures cancel thunderbirds ' appearances past april 1 1 march 2013 usaf thunderbirds team members made

) , p . 207 . ; north american f-100 super sabre : with the change to the f-100 super sabre in 1956 , the thunderbirds became the world 's first supersonic aerial demonstration team . that same year , the thunderbirds moved to nellis air force base , nevada , simplifying logistics and maintenance for the aircraft . the thunderbirds used the c-model super sabre from 1956–1963 . ; republic f-105 thunderchief : only six shows were flown in 1964 using the f-105 before safety concerns resulted in the team 's adoption of the f-100d . ; north american f-100 super sabre : the d-model super sabres were used from 1964–1968 . ; mcdonnell f-4 phantom ii : the 1969 conversion to the f-4 was the most extensive in the team 's history . among other modifications , paints that had worked on the f-100 appeared blotchy on the f-4 because of multicolored alloys used to resist heat and friction at mach 2 speeds . a polyurethane paint base was developed to resolve the problem . the white paint base remains a part of today 's thunderbird aircraft . a popular myth is , given the exhaust emissions of the f-4 's engines , the vertical stabilizer of the no . 4 slot aircraft was painted flat black . however , this is false ; the vertical stabilizer of the no . 4 slot aircraft was allowed to be blackened by jet exhaust starting in 1960 . phantoms were used from 1969 to 1973 . ; northrop t-38 talon : the fuel crisis of the early 1970s resulted in the selection of the t-38 talon , a supersonic trainer . five t-38s used the same amount of fuel needed for one f-4 phantom , and fewer people and equipment were required to maintain the aircraft . although it met the criteria of demonstrating the capabilities of a prominent air force aircraft , the talon failed to fulfill the thunderbird tradition of flying front-line jet fighters . the team flew the talon from 1974–1981 . accidents . the thunderbirds have performed at over 4,000 airshows worldwide , accumulating millions of miles in hundreds of different airframes over the course of their more than fifty-four years of service . flying high-performance fighter jets is inherently dangerous ; when flying in extremely close formation , the danger is compounded . in total , twenty-one thunderbirds pilots have been killed in the team 's history . only three fatal crashes have occurred during air shows , two of them in jets : the first was the death of major joe howard , flying thunderbird no . 3 ( f-4e s/n 66-0321 ) on 4 june 1972 at dulles airport , during transpo 72 . his phantom experienced a structural failure of the horizontal stabilizer , and major howard ejected as the aircraft fell back to earth tail first from about 1,500 feet and descended under a good canopy , but he landed in the aircraft fireball and did not survive . usaf aircraft accidents – life sciences aspects , april–june 1972 , directorate of aerospace safety , air force inspection and safety center , norton afb , california , pp . 59–60 . the second death occurred 9 may 1981 at hill afb , utah , when captain david '' nick '' hauck flying thunderbird no . 6 ( t-38a ) crashed while performing the hi-lo maneuver . capt hauck crashed while attempting to land his ailing t-38 after an engine malfunctioned and caught fire . with black smoke billowing from the exhaust and the aircraft losing altitude in a high nose-up attitude , the safety officer on the ground radioed capt hauck : '' you 're on fire , punch out ! '' to that , he responded : '' hang on . we have a bunch of people down there '' . the aircraft continued to stay airborne for about half a mile before hitting a large oak tree and a barn , then sliding across a field and flipping as it traversed an irrigation canal—ultimately erupting into a fireball just a few hundred feet from the runway 's end . no one on the ground was injured , even though the accident occurred adjacent to a roadway packed with onlookers . list of air show accidents and incidents 1981 . air shows . thumb 24 september 1961 : tsgt john lesso of the thunderbirds c-123 crew was killed when an air force c-123 carrying the army golden knights , on which he was flight engineer , crashed during takeoff at an airshow in wilmington , north carolina . 4 june 1972 : major joe howard , flying thunderbird no . 3 ( f-4 s/n 66-0321 ) , was killed during the transpo '72 airshow at dulles international airport in northern virginia . 9 may 1981 : capt nick hauck was killed in the crash of thunderbird no . 6 ( northrop t-38 ) during a low approach during an air show at hill air force base , near ogden , utah . 14 september 2003 : captain chris stricklin , flying thunderbird no . 6 ( f-16 ) , crashed during an airshow at mountain home afb , idaho . immediately after takeoff , stricklin attempted a '' split s '' maneuver ( which he had successfully performed over 200 times ) based on an incorrect mean-sea-level elevation of the airfield , higher than the home base at nellis . climbing to only above ground level instead of , stricklin had insufficient altitude to complete the maneuver , but guided the f-16c aircraft down the runway away from the spectators and ejected less than one second before impact . he survived with only minor injuries and no one on the ground was injured , but the 20 million aircraft was completely destroyed . official procedure for demonstration '' split s '' maneuvers was changed , and the usaf now requires thunderbird pilots and airshow ground controllers to both work in above-msl ( mean-sea-level ) altitudes , as opposed to ground control working in agl ( above-ground-level ) and pilots in msl , which led to two sets of numbers that had to be reconciled by the pilot . thunderbird pilots now also climb an extra before performing the split s maneuver . 20 august 2005 : the thunderbirds temporarily grounded themselves pending an investigation into a minor mid-air incident during the chicago air & water show . during the diamond pass in review , the tip of the missile rail on the right wing of the slot ( 4 ) aircraft contacted the left stabilator of the right ( 3 ) aircraft . a four-foot section of the missile rail snapped off , while the no . 3 aircraft sustained damage described by one of the thunderbirds pilots as a '' medium deep scratch '' to the red paint of the stabilator . this is why the usaf thunderbirds have taken extra precaution when flying their diamond , changing from about one and a half feet wingtip to canopy separation to around three feet . amateur video showed the missile rail falling into the '' safety box '' on lake michigan away from boaters . while there were no injuries and the aircraft remained flight worthy , the demonstration was immediately terminated , all aircraft returned to gary international airport , and the thunderbirds did not perform on the second day of the chicago show . the right wing pilot ( 3 ) was major d . chris callahan , and the slot position ( 4 ) was flown by major steve horton . 2 june 2016 : major alex turner , flying thunderbird no . 6 , crashed in a field near colorado springs , colorado after performing a flyover at the united states air force academy graduation ceremony . the f-16 pilot ejected and was unhurt . investigation revealed that the aircraft 's engine was inadvertently shut down at the start of landing procedures when a faulty throttle trigger permitted the throttle to be rotated into an engine cut-off position . in a strange twist later that day , the thunderbirds ' naval counterparts in the blue angels suffered a fatal crash of their own . 23 june 2017 : capt . erik gonsalves was injured when , during landing , thunderbird no . 8 ran off the runway and overturned prior to the vectren dayton air show . the pilot and a passenger , technical sgt . kenneth cordova , were trapped in the aircraft for over an hour . cordova was uninjured . the investigation revealed excessive air speed coupled with landing too far down a wet runway caused the jet to leave the airstrip and flip over . rain on the canopy windscreen and failure to follow proper braking procedures during the landing contributed to the accident . . other fatalities . 11 december 1954 : capt george kevil was killed during solo training at luke in an f-84g . 26 september 1957 : 1st lt bob rutte was killed in solo training at nellis . 9 october 1958 : nineteen men aboard the thunderbirds ' support c-123 were killed in a crash about northwest of boise , idaho , while en route to mcchord afb , washington , reportedly when the transport struck a flock of geese . 12 march 1959 : capt c . d .
