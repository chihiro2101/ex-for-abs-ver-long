Sympathetic nervous system

structure . there are two kinds of neurons involved in the transmission of any signal through the sympathetic system : pre-ganglionic and post-ganglionic . the shorter preganglionic neurons originate in the thoracolumbar division of the spinal cord specifically at t1 to l2~l3 , and travel to a ganglion , often one of the paravertebral ganglia , where they synapse with a postganglionic neuron . from there , the long postganglionic fibers extend across most of the body . at the synapses within the ganglia , preganglionic neurons release acetylcholine , a neurotransmitter that activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on postganglionic neurons . in response to this stimulus , the postganglionic neurons release norepinephrine , which activates adrenergic receptors that are present on the peripheral target tissues . the activation of target tissue receptors causes the effects associated with the sympathetic system . however , there are three important exceptions : postganglionic neurons of sweat glands release acetylcholine for the activation of muscarinic receptors , except for areas of thick skin , the palms and the plantar surfaces of the feet , where norepinephrine is released and acts on adrenergic receptors . chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla are analogous to post-ganglionic neurons ; the adrenal medulla develops in tandem with the sympathetic nervous system and acts as a modified sympathetic ganglion . within this endocrine gland , pre-ganglionic neurons synapse with chromaffin cells , triggering the release of two transmitters : a small proportion of norepinephrine , and more substantially , epinephrine . the synthesis and release of epinephrine as opposed to norepinephrine is another distinguishing feature of chromaffin cells compared to postganglionic sympathetic neurons . postganglionic sympathetic nerves terminating in the kidney release dopamine , which acts on dopamine d1 receptors of blood vessels to control how much blood the kidney filters . dopamine is the immediate metabolic precursor to norepinephrine , but is nonetheless a distinct signaling molecule . . organization . sympathetic nerves arise from near the middle of the spinal cord in the intermediolateral nucleus of the lateral grey column , beginning at the first thoracic vertebra of the vertebral column and are thought to extend to the second or third lumbar vertebra . because its cells begin in the thoracolumbar division – the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord - the sympathetic nervous system is said to have a thoracolumbar outflow . axons of these nerves leave the spinal cord through the anterior root . they pass near the spinal ( sensory ) ganglion , where they enter the anterior rami of the spinal nerves . however , unlike somatic innervation , they quickly separate out through white rami connectors ( so called from the shiny white sheaths of myelin around each axon ) that connect to either the paravertebral ( which lie near the vertebral column ) or prevertebral ( which lie near the aortic bifurcation ) ganglia extending alongside the spinal column . to reach target organs and glands , the axons must travel long distances in the body , and , to accomplish this , many axons relay their message to a second cell through synaptic transmission . the ends of the axons link across a space , the synapse , to the dendrites of the second cell . the first cell ( the presynaptic cell ) sends a neurotransmitter across the synaptic cleft where it activates the second cell ( the postsynaptic cell ) . the message is then carried to the final destination . presynaptic nerves ' axons terminate in either the paravertebral ganglia or prevertebral ganglia . there are four different paths an axon can take before reaching its terminal . in all cases , the axon enters the paravertebral ganglion at the level of its originating spinal nerve . after this , it can then either synapse in this ganglion , ascend to a more superior or descend to a more inferior paravertebral ganglion and synapse there , or it can descend to a prevertebral ganglion and synapse there with the postsynaptic cell . the postsynaptic cell then goes on to innervate the targeted end effector ( i.e . gland , smooth muscle , etc . ) . because paravertebral and prevertebral ganglia are relatively close to the spinal cord , presynaptic neurons are generally much shorter than their postsynaptic counterparts , which must extend throughout the body to reach their destinations . a notable exception to the routes mentioned above is the sympathetic innervation of the suprarenal ( adrenal ) medulla . in this case , presynaptic neurons pass through paravertebral ganglia , on through prevertebral ganglia and then synapse directly with suprarenal tissue . this tissue consists of cells that have pseudo-neuron like qualities in that when activated by the presynaptic neuron , they will release their neurotransmitter ( epinephrine ) directly into the bloodstream . in the sympathetic nervous system and other components of the peripheral nervous system , these synapses are made at sites called ganglia . the cell that sends its fiber is called a preganglionic cell , while the cell whose fiber leaves the ganglion is called a postganglionic cell . as mentioned previously , the preganglionic cells of the sympathetic nervous system are located between the first thoracic segment and third lumbar segments of the spinal cord . postganglionic cells have their cell bodies in the ganglia and send their axons to target organs or glands . the ganglia include not just the sympathetic trunks but also the cervical ganglia ( superior , middle and inferior ) , which send sympathetic nerve fibers to the head and thorax organs , and the celiac and mesenteric ganglia , which send sympathetic fibers to the gut . information transmission . messages travel through the sympathetic nervous system in a bi-directional flow . efferent messages can trigger changes in different parts of the body simultaneously . for example , the sympathetic nervous system can accelerate heart rate ; widen bronchial passages ; decrease motility ( movement ) of the large intestine ; constrict blood vessels ; increase peristalsis in the oesophagus ; cause pupillary dilation , piloerection ( goose bumps ) and perspiration ( sweating ) ; and raise blood pressure . one exception is with certain blood vessels such as those in the cerebral and coronary arteries , which dilate ( rather than constrict ) with an increase in sympathetic tone . this is because of a proportional increase in the presence of β 2 adrenergic receptors rather than α 1 receptors . β 2 receptors promote vessel dilation instead of constriction like α1 receptors . an alternative explanation is that the primary ( and direct ) effect of sympathetic stimulation on coronary arteries is vasoconstriction followed by a secondary vasodilation caused by the release of vasodilatory metabolites due to the sympathetically increased cardiac inotropy and heart rate . this secondary vasodilation caused by the primary vasoconstriction is termed functional sympatholysis , the overall effect of which on coronary arteries is dilation . the target synapse of the postganglionic neuron is mediated by adrenergic receptors and is activated by either norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) or epinephrine ( adrenaline ) . function . the sympathetic nervous system is responsible for up- and down-regulating many homeostatic mechanisms in living organisms . fibers from the sns innervate tissues in almost every organ system , providing at least some regulation of functions as diverse as pupil diameter , gut motility , and urinary system output and function . it is perhaps best known for mediating the neuronal and hormonal stress response commonly known as the fight-or-flight response . this response is also known as sympatho-adrenal response of the body , as the preganglionic sympathetic fibers that end in the adrenal medulla ( but also all other sympathetic fibers ) secrete acetylcholine , which activates the great secretion of adrenaline ( epinephrine ) and to a lesser extent noradrenaline ( norepinephrine ) from it . therefore , this response that acts primarily on the cardiovascular system is mediated directly via impulses transmitted through the sympathetic nervous system and indirectly via catecholamines secreted from the adrenal medulla . the sympathetic nervous system is responsible for priming the body for action , particularly in situations threatening survival . one example of this priming is in the moments before waking , in which sympathetic outflow spontaneously increases in preparation for action . sympathetic nervous system stimulation causes vasoconstriction of most blood vessels , including many of those in the skin , the digestive tract , and the kidneys . this occurs as a result of activation of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors by norepinephrine released by post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons . these receptors exist throughout the vasculature of the body but are inhibited and counterbalanced by beta-2 adrenergic receptors ( stimulated by epinephrine release from the adrenal glands ) in the skeletal muscles , the heart , the lungs , and the brain during a sympathoadrenal response . the net effect of this is a shunting of blood away from the organs not necessary to the immediate survival of the organism and an increase in blood flow to those organs involved in intense physical activity . sensation . the afferent fibers of the autonomic nervous system , which transmit sensory information from the internal organs of the body back to the central nervous system ( or cns ) , are not divided into parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers as the efferent fibers are . moore , k.l . , & agur , a.m .
