Newark-on-Trent

history . early history . the place-name newark is first attested in the cartulary of eynsham abbey in oxfordshire , where it appears as newercha in about 1054–1057 and niweweorche in about 1075–1092 . it appears as newerche in the 1086 domesday book . the name means 'new work ' , with the apparent meaning of '' new fort '' . eilert ekwall , the concise oxford dictionary of english place-names , p . 339 . the origins of the town are possibly roman , due to its position on an important roman road , the fosse way . in a document which purports to be a charter of ad 664 , newark is mentioned as having been granted to the abbey of peterborough by king wulfhere of mercia . an anglo-saxon pagan cemetery , used from the early 5th to early 7th centuries , has been found in millgate , newark , close to the fosse way and the river trent . there cremated remains were buried in pottery urns . in the reign of edward the confessor , newark belonged to godiva and her husband leofric , earl of mercia , who granted it to stow minster in 1055 . after the norman conquest , stow minster retained the revenues of newark , but it came under the control of the norman bishop remigius de fécamp , after whose death control passed to the bishops of lincoln from 1092 until the reign of edward vi . there were burgesses in newark at the time of the domesday survey . the reign of edward iii shows evidence that it had long been a borough by prescription . the newark wapentake ( hundred ) in the east of nottinghamshire was established in the period of anglo-saxon rule ( 10th–11th centuries ) . medieval to stuart period . newark castle was originally a saxon fortified manor house founded by king edward the elder . in 1073 , remigius de fécamp , bishop of lincoln , founded an earthwork motte and bailey fortress on the site . the river bridge was built about this time under a charter from henry i , as was st leonard 's hospital . the bishop also gained from the king a charter to hold a five-day fair at the castle each year , and under king stephen to establish a mint . king john died of dysentery in newark castle in 1216 . the town became a local centre for the wool and cloth trade – by the time of henry ii a major market was established . wednesday and saturday markets in the town were founded in the period 1156–1329 , under a series of charters from the bishop of lincoln . after his death , henry iii tried to bring order to the country , but the mercenary robert de gaugy refused to yield newark castle to the bishop of lincoln , its rightful owner . this led to the dauphin of france ( later king louis viii of france ) laying an eight-day siege on behalf of the king , ended by an agreement to pay the mercenary to leave . around the time of edward iii 's death in '' 1377 poll tax records show an adult population of 1,178 , excluding beggars and clergy , making newark one of the biggest 25 or so towns in england '' . newark future , 2008 . in 1457 a flood swept away the bridge over the trent . although there was no legal requirement to do so , the bishop of lincoln , john chaworth , funded a new bridge of oak with stone defensive towers at either end . in january 1571 or 1572 , the composer robert parsons fell into the swollen river trent at newark and drowned . after the break with rome in the 16th century , the establishment of the church of england , and the dissolution of the monasteries , henry viii had the vicar of newark , henry lytherland , executed for refusing to acknowledge the king as head of the church . the dissolution affected newark 's political landscape , and even more radical changes came in 1547 , when the bishop of lincoln exchanged ownership of the town with the crown . newark was incorporated under an alderman and twelve assistants in 1549 , and the charter was confirmed and extended by elizabeth i . charles i reincorporated the town under a mayor and aldermen , owing to its increasing commercial prosperity . this charter , except for a temporary surrender under james ii , continued to govern the corporation until the municipal corporations act 1835 . the civil war . during the english civil war , newark was a mainstay of the royalist cause , charles i having raised his standard in nearby nottingham . '' newark was besieged on three occasions and finally surrendered only when ordered to do so by the king after his own surrender . '' newark civil war trail . it was attacked in february 1643 by two troops of horsemen , but beat them back . the town fielded at times as many as 600 soldiers , and raided nottingham , grantham , northampton , gainsborough and other places with mixed success , but enough to cause it to rise to national notice . in 1644 newark was besieged by forces from nottingham , lincoln and derby , until relieved in march by prince rupert . parliament commenced a new siege towards the end of january 1645 after more raiding , but this was relieved about a month later by sir marmaduke langdale . newark cavalry fought with the king 's forces , which were decisively defeated in the battle of naseby , near leicester in june 1645 . the final siege began in november 1645 , by which time the town 's defences had been greatly strengthened . two major forts had been constructed just outside the town , one called the queen 's sconce to the south-west , and another , the king 's sconce , to the north-east , both close to the river , with defensive walls and a water-filled ditch of 2¼ miles around the town . the king 's may 1646 order to surrender was only accepted under protest by the town 's garrison . after that , much of the defences was destroyed , including the castle , which was left in essentially the state it can be seen today . the queen 's sconce was left largely untouched and its remains are in sconce and devon park . georgian era and early 19th century . around 1770 the great north road around newark ( now the a1 ) was raised on a long series of arches to ensure it remained clear of the regular floods . a special act of parliament in 1773 allowed the creation of a town hall next to the market place . designed by john carr of york and completed in 1776 , newark town hall is now a grade i listed building , housing a museum and art gallery . in 1775 the duke of newcastle , at the time the lord of the manor and a major landowner in the area , built a new brick bridge with stone facing to replace a dilapidated one next to the castle . this is still one of the town 's major thoroughfares today . a noted 18th-century advocate of reform in newark was the local printer and newspaper owner daniel holt ( 1766–1799 ) . he was imprisoned for printing a leaflet advocating parliamentary reform , and for selling a pamphlet by thomas paine . an account of holt 's life by alan dorling appears in the nottinghamshire historian journal , spring/summer 2000 , pp . 9–15 , with further detail in autumn/winter 2003 , pp . 8–12 . in a milieu of parliamentary reform , the duke of newcastle evicted over a hundred tenants at newark whom he believed to support directly or indirectly at the 1829 elections the liberal/radical candidate ( wilde ) , rather than his candidate , ( michael sadler , a progressive conservative ) . see the report in cornelius brown 1907 , ii , 243 following ; and the report in the times for 7 october 1829 . a report in the times of 10 september 1832 lists ten of the evicted people by name and address . j . s . baxter , a schoolboy in newark in 1830–1840 , contributed to the hungry forties : life under the bread tax ( london , 1904 ) , a book about the corn laws : '' chartists and rioters came from nottingham into newark , parading the streets with penny loaves dripped in blood carried on pikes , crying 'bread or blood ' .
