London Philharmonic Orchestra

1960s and 70s . in 1962 the orchestra undertook its first tour of india , australia , and the far east . the conductors were sargent and john pritchard . the latter was appointed the lpo 's chief conductor in 1962 , presiding over what one player described as '' an era of supremely good taste '' . from its outset in 1932 , harpists ( traditionally female ) excepted , the orchestra had maintained beecham 's '' men only '' regime ; in 1963 the rule was dropped , the first woman violinist was recruited , and within two years female players achieved equal conditions of membership with their male colleagues . pirouet , p . & nbsp ; 132 . pritchard was also music director of glyndebourne festival opera in sussex , and it was partly due to his influence that in 1964 the lpo replaced the rpo as glyndebourne 's resident orchestra , providing the players with stable guaranteed work in the slack summer months . pirouet , pp . & nbsp ; 132 & nbsp ; and & nbsp ; 134 . the number of lpo concerts in the provinces fell during the 1960s , and ceased to be a major factor in the orchestra 's finances . pirouet , p . & nbsp ; 139 . during the 1960s the orchestra gave fund-raising concerts in which guests from outside the world of classical music appeared , including danny kaye , duke ellington and tony bennett . its regular complement at the end of the decade was 88 players . peacock , p . & nbsp ; 8 . in 1967 the lpo appointed bernard haitink as its principal conductor . he remained with the orchestra for twelve years , to date ( 2018 ) the longest tenure of the post . his concerts made a strong impression with the public , and within months the lpo was playing to ninety per cent capacity audiences at the festival hall , far outstripping the other london orchestras . pirouet , p . & nbsp ; 138 . among the composers with whom haitink was associated were bruckner and mahler , whose symphonies featured frequently in the lpo 's concerts during the haitink period , as did those of shostakovich , particularly the tenth , which pirouet describes as the calling card of the orchestra and conductor . pirouet , p . & nbsp ; 149 . with vladimir ashkenazy , haitink and the lpo gave a six-concert cycle of the beethoven symphonies and piano concertos , for which the festival hall was full to capacity . in the times , joan chissell described the orchestra 's playing as '' worthy of any festival '' . chissell , joan . '' lpo/haitink '' , the times , 18 march 1974 , p . & nbsp ; 9 . there was some discontent within the lpo that haitink 's prolific recordings were almost always with the other orchestra of which he was the chief conductor , the amsterdam concertgebouw . pirouet comments that as haitink recorded exclusively for the dutch firm philips it was to be expected that the amsterdam orchestra would be preferred , and in any case the lpo was recording extensively with boult , solti , daniel barenboim and many others . pirouet , p . & nbsp ; 153 . in the 1970s international tours continued , with itineraries taking in the us , western europe , the soviet union , and , in 1972 , china , long inaccessible to western musicians , where the orchestra met an enthusiastic welcome . pirouet , p . & nbsp ; 150 . in 1973 the lpo was caught up in a recurring phenomenon of london orchestral life : the conviction in official circles that having four independent orchestras is too much for one city , and that two or more of the existing ensembles should merge . on this occasion the targets were the lpo and the new philharmonia ; the latter , a self-governing body formed under its new name when the philharmonia was disbanded in 1964 , was going through a bad patch , professionally and financially . the proposed merger would inevitably have led to redundancies , and the player-owners of both orchestras rejected the plan . pirouet , p . & nbsp ; 155 . one of the constant difficulties of london orchestras was the lack of good rehearsal space and facilities . in 1973 , acting jointly with the lso , the lpo acquired and began restoring a disused church in southwark , converting it into the henry wood hall , a convenient and acoustically excellent rehearsal space and recording studio , opened in 1975 . mann , william . '' the making of a rehearsal hall '' , the times , 17 june 1975 , p . & nbsp ; 11 . guest conductors in the 1970s included erich leinsdorf , carlo maria giulini , eugen jochum , riccardo chailly , klaus tennstedt and solti . when haitink announced in 1977 that he would step down as principal conductor at the end of the 1978–79 season , solti , who had been principal guest conductor since 1971 , agreed to succeed him . pirouet , p . & nbsp ; 147 . . 1980s and 90s . in 1982 the orchestra celebrated its golden jubilee . at the anniversary concert solti conducted the programme with which beecham had inaugurated the lpo . pirouet comments that with the exception of delius 's brigg fair , the music was as ideally suited to solti 's musical persona as to beecham's . pirouet , p . & nbsp ; 174 . in the guardian , edward greenfield wrote , '' i doubt if the lpo has ever played so beautifully , even in the days of beecham '' . greenfield , edward . '' lpo/solti – 50th anniversary '' , the guardian , 8 october 1982 , p . & nbsp ; 10 . solti stepped down at the end of the jubilee season , and was succeeded by klaus tennstedt , of whom the times commented , '' tennstedt found the orchestra sensitive and flexible , and his players regarded him with a warmth that is by no means universally extended by musicians to their conductors '' . '' klaus tennstedt '' , the times , 13 january 1998 , p . & nbsp ; 21 . his time as chief conductor ( 1983–87 ) was celebrated for its musical achievements , but was marked by his failing health and frequent cancellations . as with haitink and solti , bruckner and mahler were prominent in the lpo 's concerts with tennstedt . unlike his two predecessors tennstedt preferred to record with the lpo rather than major continental or american orchestras ; among the many sets they made together was a complete cycle of mahler 's symphonies for emi . greenfield , edward . '' a german vision for london music '' , the guardian , 13 january 1998 , p . & nbsp ; 16 . in 1984 the lpo and the philharmonia began negotiations that went on for years following an arts council proposal to name one london orchestra as the principal resident orchestra of the festival hall , with concomitant extra funding . the two orchestras were interested in making a counter-proposal for a joint residency , but the matter was not resolved until 1995 when their plan was finally implemented . pirouet , pp . & nbsp ; 183 & nbsp ; and & nbsp ; 223 . from the outset of the lpo 's existence as a self-governing co-operative in 1939 , its chief executive had always been appointed from within the orchestra 's ranks . in 1985 this tradition was broken with the recruitment of john willan , a qualified accountant as well as an alumnus of the royal academy of music and a successful recording producer for emi . pirouet , p . & nbsp ; 187 . in august 1987 tennstedt , taken ill at a rehearsal , felt so unequal to continuing in his post that he resigned on the spot . he continued to appear with the lpo as a guest , with the title of '' conductor laureate '' ; in 1989 richard morrison of the times wrote that the lpo still played better for tennstedt than for anyone else . morrison , richard . '' mahler 's quiet hero '' , the times , 17 february 1989 , p . & nbsp ; 18 . tennstedt 's resignation was a severe blow to the orchestra , and there was no obvious successor : morrison observed that the best-known conductors – barenboim , riccardo muti and simon rattle – with whom the orchestra was then associated were committed to other projects until the 1990s , and those possible contenders such as semyon bychkov and franz welser-möst were largely unknown in london . morrison , richard . '' tennstedt hard to replace '' , the times , 26 august 1987 , p . & nbsp ; 14 . no successor was appointed until 1990 when welser-möst was named as the new principal conductor . his tenure was controversial ; he received the nickname '' frankly worse than most '' and many harshly critical reviews . hewett , ivan . '' why all those insults made me stronger '' , the daily telegraph , 18 august 2005 he brought with him a recording contract with emi , but management turnover , financial stresses , and political disputes at the southbank centre at the time contributed to the difficulty of the working atmosphere in the orchestra . kenyon , nicholas '' a young conductor starts at the top '' , the new york times , 15 march 1992 ; and oestreich , james r . '' battered but unbowed , a maestro rebounds '' , the new york times , 13 november 1994 there were complaints that the orchestra 's high standards of playing were not consistently maintained . milnes , rodney . '' and lost at sea '' , the times , 22 may 1996 , p . & nbsp ; 33 . welser-möst 's period as principal conductor coincided with the installation of the lpo as the sole resident orchestra of the festival hall . this proved a mixed blessing : the southbank centre management now had a say over concert programming , and insisted on the inclusion of works by obscure composers which did severe damage to box-office receipts . pirouet , p . & nbsp ; 208 . in 1993 another official attempt to create a '' super-orchestra '' at the expense of one or more of the existing london ensembles briefly damaged relations between the lpo and the philharmonia , but the idea was quickly abandoned , and in 1995 , with the consent of the arts council , the two orchestras agreed to share the residency at the festival hall . pirouet , pp . & nbsp ; 217–220 , & nbsp ; and & nbsp ; 223 . in the mid-1990s , the lpo released albums as a tribute to rock bands , such as led zeppelin , mike oldfield and pink floyd , with cover versions of songs by them . in 1993 , with the government of south africa now moving towards majority rule , the orchestra accepted an invitation to tour there . pirouet , p . & nbsp ; 213 . welser-möst concluded his lpo tenure in 1996 , after what the guardian called '' a fraught few years in which the high hopes placed in him were somehow not fulfilled .
