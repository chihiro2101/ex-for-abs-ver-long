British Free Corps

formation . the idea for the british free corps came from john amery , a british fascist , son of the serving british secretary of state for india , leo amery . john amery travelled to berlin in october 1942 , and proposed to the germans the formation of a british volunteer force to help fight the bolsheviks . the british volunteer force was to be modelled after the légion des volontaires français contre le bolchévisme ( legion of french volunteers against bolshevism ) , a french collaborationist force fighting with the german wehrmacht . in addition to touting the idea of a british volunteer force , amery actively tried to recruit britons . he made a series of pro-german propaganda radio broadcasts , appealing to his fellow countrymen to join the war on communism . the first recruits to the corps came from a group of prisoner of war ( pows ) at a 'holiday camp ' set up by the germans in genshagen , a suburb of berlin , in august 1943 . weale , adrian ( 12 november 2014 ) . renegades ( kindle location 1948 ) . random house . kindle edition . in november 1943 , they were moved to a requisitioned café in the pankow district of berlin . weale , adrian ( 12 november 2014 ) . renegades ( kindle location 2002 ) . random house . kindle edition . recruits also came from an interrogation camp at luckenwalde in late 1943 . weale , adrian ( 12 november 2014 ) . renegades ( kindle location 2083 ) . random house . kindle edition . the corps became a military unit on 1 january 1944 , under the name ‘ the british free corps ’ . weale , adrian ( 12 november 2014 ) . renegades ( kindle locations 2172-2173 ) . random house . kindle edition . in the first week of february 1944 , the bfc moved to the st michaeli kloster in hildesheim , a small town near hanover . weale , adrian ( 12 november 2014 ) . renegades ( kindle location 2264 ) . random house . kindle edition . uniforms were issued on 20 april 1944 ( hitler 's 55th birthday ) . weale , adrian ( 12 november 2014 ) . renegades ( kindle location 2331 ) . random house . kindle edition . on 11 october 1944 , the corps was moved to the waffen-ss pioneer school in dresden , to start military training for service on the eastern front . weale , adrian ( 12 november 2014 ) . renegades ( kindle locations 2529-2530 , 2793 ) . random house . kindle edition . on 24 february 1945 , they travelled from dresden to berlin , where they stayed in a requisitioned school on the schönhauser allee . weale , adrian ( 12 november 2014 ) . renegades ( kindle locations 2979-2980 ) . random house . kindle edition . on 8 march 1945 , they were moved to the village of niemegk , a few miles to the south-west of berlin . weale , adrian ( 12 november 2014 ) . renegades ( kindle location 3007 ) . random house . kindle edition . recruiting for the free corps was done in german pow camps . in 1944 , leaflets were distributed to the pows , and the unit was mentioned in camp , the official pow newspaper published in berlin . the unit was promoted '' as a thoroughly volunteer unit , conceived and created by british subjects from all parts of the empire who have taken up arms and pledged their lives in the common european struggle against soviet russia '' . the attempted recruitment of pows was done amid german fear of the soviets ; the germans were '' victims of their own propaganda '' and thought that their enemies were as worried about the soviets as they were . in one dutch camp , cigarettes , fruit , and other items were lavished on the pows while they listened to nazi propaganda officers who described the good that the germans were doing in europe , then asked the men to join in fighting the real enemy , the soviets . . commanders . the bfc did not have a '' commander '' per se as it was the intention of the ss to appoint a british commander when a suitable british officer came forward . however , three german waffen-ss officers acted as the verbindungsoffizier ( '' liaison officer '' ) between the ss-hauptamt amtsgruppe d/3 , which was responsible for the unit and the british volunteers , and in practice they acted as the unit commander for disciplinary purposes at least . these were : ss-hauptsturmführer hans werner roepke : september 1943 – november 1944 weale , renegades , p . 114 ss-obersturmführer dr walter kühlich : november 1944 – april 1945 weale , renegades , p . 149 ss-hauptsturmführer dr alexander dolezalek : april 1945 weale , renegades , p . 160 a number of sources mention the involvement of brigadier leonard parrington , a british army officer captured by the germans in greece in 1941 . see , for example , waffen-ss : hitler 's elite guard at war by george h stein , cornell university press , 1966 , p . 190 this was based on a misunderstanding by some of the british volunteers after parrington in the summer of 1943 had visited the pow '' holiday camp '' at genshagen , in the southern suburbs of berlin , as representative of the senior british pow , major general victor fortune . parrington had told the assembled prisoners that he '' knew the purpose of the camp '' weale , adrian ( 12 november 2014 ) . renegades ( kindle location 1961 ) . random house . kindle edition and the bfc volunteers who were there took this to mean that he approved of the unit . in reality , parrington had accepted genshagen at face value as a rest centre for pows . members . leading members of the corps included thomas haller cooper ( although he was actually an unterscharführer in the waffen-ss proper ' weale , adrian ( 12 november 2014 ) . renegades ( kindle location 2297 ) . random house . kindle edition ) , roy courlander , edwin barnard martin , frank mclardy , alfred minchin and john wilson – these men '' later became known among the renegades as the ‘ big six ’ , although this was a notional elite whose membership shifted periodically as members fell into , and out of , favour .
