Roy Harris

life . harris was born in chandler , oklahoma on february 12 , 1898 . his ancestry consisted of scottish , irish and welsh . in 1903 , his father was able to combine the proceeds of the auction of his oklahoma homestead with his winnings from a lucky gambling streak to purchase some land near covina in the san gabriel valley of southern california and move the family there . stehman 1984 , 8 . roy harris grew up as a farmer in this rural , isolated environment . he studied piano with his mother , and later clarinet . though he studied at the university of california , berkeley , he was still virtually self-taught when he began writing music of his own . in the early 1920s , he had lessons from arthur bliss ( then in santa barbara ) and the senior american composer and researcher of american indian music , arthur farwell . harris sold his farmland and supported himself as a truck-driver and delivery man for a dairy farm . gradually , he made contacts in the east with other young composers , and , partly through aaron copland 's recommendation , he was able to spend 1926–29 in paris , as one of the many young americans who received their final musical grooming in the masterclasses of nadia boulanger . harris had no time for boulanger 's neoclassical , stravinsky-derived aesthetic , but under her tutelage he began his lifelong study of renaissance music , and wrote his first significant work : the concerto for piano , clarinet and string quartet . stehman 1984 , 20 . after suffering a serious back injury , harris was obliged to return for treatment to the united states , where he formed associations with howard hanson at the eastman school of music in rochester and , more importantly , with serge koussevitsky at the boston symphony orchestra . these associations secured performance outlets for the large-scale works he was writing . in 1934 , a week after its first performance under koussevitsky , his symphony '1933 became the first american symphony to be commercially recorded . it was his symphony no . & nbsp ; 3 , however , first performed by koussevitsky in 1939 , which proved to be the composer 's biggest breakthrough and made him practically a household name . oliver 1987 ; lamkin 2016 . during the 1930s harris taught at mills college , westminster choir college ( 1934–1938 ) and the juilliard school of music . he spent most of the rest of his professional career restlessly moving through teaching posts and residences at american colleges and universities . his final posts were in california , first at ucla and then at california state university , los angeles . among his pupils were william schuman , h . owen reed , john donald robb , robert turner , lorne betts , george lynn , john verrall , florence price , regina hansen willman , and peter schickele ( best known as the creator of p.d.q . bach ) . he received many of america 's most prestigious cultural awards , and at the end of his life was proclaimed honorary composer laureate of the state of california . lamkin 2016 his work was also part of the music event in the art competition at the 1936 summer olympics . in 1936 harris married the young pianist johana harris ( née duffey ) who went on to a highly successful career , making numerous recordings and appearing as a soloist with almost every major american symphony orchestra . she also had a long career teaching on the piano faculty at the juilliard school . her name prior to their marriage was beula duffey , but harris convinced her to change it to johana after j.s . bach . the canadian encyclopedia states , '' johana and roy harris were a tour de force in american music . their collaboration has been compared to that of robert and clara schumann . the harrises organized concerts , adjudicated at festivals , and in 1959 founded the international string congress . they promoted american folksong by including folksongs in their concerts and broadcasts . '' gillard 2013 . the couple had 5 children : patricia , shaun , daniel , maureen and lane . their two sons performed with the west coast pop art experimental band , a los angeles-based psychedelic rock band of the late 1960s , deming n.d . and roy harris provided string arrangements on shaun 's self-titled solo album in 1973 . ankeny n.d . harris was among he founders of the music academy of the west summer conservatory in 1947 . . character , reputation , and style characteristics . harris was a champion of many causes . he founded the international string congress to combat what was perceived as a shortage of string players in the u.s . , and co-founded the american composers alliance . in 1958 the u.s . state department sent him , along with some fellow composers including peter mennin and roger sessions , to the soviet union as a '' cultural ambassador '' ; he was impressed by the support for composers that the soviet state provided , not aware at the time of how carefully his visit was managed . stehman 1984 , 103 and n4 . he was a tireless organizer of conferences and contemporary music festivals and a frequent radio broadcaster . his last symphony , a commission for the american bicentennial in 1976 , was mauled by the critics at its first performance . this may have been due to its themes of slavery and the civil war , which were in contrast to the celebratory mood of the country . stehman 1984 , 145–146 . although the rugged american patriotism of his works of the 1930s and 1940s is reflected in his research into and use of folk music ( and to a lesser extent of jazz rhythms ) , harris was paradoxically obsessed with the great european pre-classical forms , especially the fugue ( which we hear in the third symphony ) and passacaglia ( as featured in the seventh ) . his customary mode of musical discourse , with long singing lines and resonant modal harmonies , is ultimately based on his admiration for and development of renaissance polyphony . he also used antiphonal effects , which he exploited brilliantly with a large orchestra . like many american composers of his time , he was deeply impressed by the symphonic achievement of sibelius . in harris 's best works the music grows organically from the opening bars , as if a tiny seed gives birth to an entire tree . this is certainly the case with the third symphony , which joined the american repertoire during the same era as works by aaron copland and virgil thomson . the first edition of kent kennan 's the technique of orchestration ( 1952 ) quotes three passages from this symphony to illustrate good orchestral writing for cello , timpani , and vibraphone , respectively . the book quotes no other harris symphonies . few other american symphonies have acquired such a position in the standard performance repertory as has this one , due in large part to the championing of the piece by leonard bernstein , who recorded it . though harris 's symphonies are his greatest contribution to american music , he composed over 170 works , including many works for amateurs . his output includes works for band , orchestra , voice , chorus and chamber ensembles . the symphonies . harris composed at least 18 symphonies , though not all of them are numbered and not all are for orchestra . a full list is as follows : symphony – our heritage ( 1925 rev . 1926 , abandoned ) , sometimes referred to as symphony no . 1 for orchestra – only an andante survives symphony – american portrait ( 1928–29 ) for orchestra symphony 1933 ( 1933 ) , sometimes referred to as symphony no . 1 for orchestra symphony no . 2 ( 1934 ) for orchestra symphony for voices ( 1935 ) after walt whitman for unaccompanied satb chorus symphony no . 3 ( 1937–38 , rev . 1939 ) for orchestra folksong symphony ( symphony no . 4 ) ( 1939 rev . 1942 ) for chorus and orchestra symphony no . 5 ( 1940–42 rev . 1945 ) for orchestra — dedicated '' to the heroic and freedom-loving people of our great ally , the union of soviet republics '' symphony no . 6 'gettysburg address ' after lincoln ( 1943–44 ) for orchestra symphony for band 'west point ' ( 1952 ) for us military band symphony no . 7 ( 1951–52 , rev . 1955 ) for orchestra symphony no . 8 'san francisco ' ( 1961–62 ) for orchestra with concertante piano symphony no . 9 ( 1962 ) for philadelphia for orchestra symphony no . 10 'abraham lincoln ' ( 1965 ) for speaker , chorus , brass , 2 pianos and percussion ;
