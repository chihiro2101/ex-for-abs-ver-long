Automotive industry

history . the automotive industry began in the 1860s with hundreds of manufacturers that pioneered the brass era car . for many decades , the united states led the world in total automobile production . in 1929 , before the great depression , the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use , and the u.s . automobile industry produced over 90 % of them . at that time , the u.s . had one car per 4.87 persons . after 1945 , the u.s . produced about 75 percent of world 's auto production . in 1980 , the u.s . was overtaken by japan and then became world 's leader again in 1994 . in 2006 , japan narrowly passed the u.s . in production and held this rank until 2009 , when china took the top spot with 13.8 million units . with 19.3 million units manufactured in 2012 , china almost doubled the u.s . production of 10.3 million units , while japan was in third place with 9.9 million units . from 1970 ( 140 models ) over 1998 ( 260 models ) to 2012 ( 684 models ) , the number of automobile models in the u.s . has grown exponentially . . safety . safety is a state that implies to be protected from any risk , danger , damage or cause of injury . in the automotive industry , safety means that users , operators or manufacturers do not face any risk or danger coming from the motor vehicle or its spare parts . safety for the automobiles themselves , implies that there is no risk of damage . safety in the automotive industry is particularly important and therefore highly regulated . automobiles and other motor vehicles have to comply with a certain number of regulations , whether local or international , in order to be accepted on the market . the standard iso 26262 , is considered as one of the best practice framework for achieving automotive functional safety . in case of safety issues , danger , product defect or faulty procedure during the manufacturing of the motor vehicle , the maker can request to return either a batch or the entire production run . this procedure is called product recall . product recalls happen in every industry and can be production-related or stem from the raw material . product and operation tests and inspections at different stages of the value chain are made to avoid these product recalls by ensuring end-user security and safety and compliance with the automotive industry requirements . however , the automotive industry is still particularly concerned about product recalls , which cause considerable financial consequences . economy . in 2007 , there were about 806 million cars and light trucks on the road , consuming over of gasoline and diesel fuel yearly . the automobile is a primary mode of transport for many developed economies . the detroit branch of boston consulting group predicted that , by 2014 , one-third of world demand would be in the four bric markets ( brazil , russia , india and china ) . meanwhile , in the developed countries , the automotive industry has slowed . it is also expected that this trend will continue , especially as the younger generations of people ( in highly urbanized countries ) no longer want to own a car anymore , and prefer other modes of transport . other potentially powerful automotive markets are iran and indonesia . emerging automobile markets already buy more cars than established markets . according to a j.d . power study , emerging markets accounted for 51 percent of the global light-vehicle sales in 2010 . the study , performed in 2010 expected this trend to accelerate . however , more recent reports ( 2012 ) confirmed the opposite ; namely that the automotive industry was slowing down even in bric countries . in the united states , vehicle sales peaked in 2000 , at 17.8 million units . . world motor vehicle production . notable company relationships .
