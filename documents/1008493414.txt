Kent Hovind

anti-evolution claims . hovind contends that darwinism produced '' communism , socialism , nazism , abortion , liberalism and the new age movement '' . he blamed the forced cherokee resettlement on a belief in evolution , although the trail of tears preceded origin of species by roughly two decades . hovind maintains that biology textbooks are lying in order to brainwash youth . he said , '' satan is using evolution theory to make kids go to hell . '' hovind claims he is not trying to eliminate evolution from schools , but says '' schools should teach both viewpoints . '' hovind said that in order to forge '' missing link '' transitional fossils to support human evolution , the smithsonian institution has 33,000 sets of human remains in its basement , some taken alive ( murder ) . in an interview prior to speaking at kent state university , hovind said '' you should have another rebellion here at kent state and do it for the right reason , '' the reason being protesting evolution and referred to the kent state shootings when he added , '' this time , do n't get shot . '' in the pseudoscience of cryptozoology , hovind published and co-authored claws , jaws , and dinosaurs with william gibbons , another creationist who has searched for mokele-mbembe under the belief that discovering a cryptid would somehow undermine evolutionary theory and that dinosaurs were dragons . dinosaur adventure land had displays about the existence of the loch ness monster and beowulf as history rather than legend . . debates . prior to his convictions , hovind was a prolific debater . while hovind campaigns against evolution , the level of support for evolution is essentially universal within the scientific community and academia ; available at wikisource : ruling , kitzmiller v . dover page 83 sample organizational statements : aaas : interacademy partnership : nsta : ncse maintains an extensive list of statements support for creationism is minimal among scientists in general , and virtually nonexistent among those in the relevant fields : biology , paleontology , geology , etc . c . a . chinn and l . a . buckland classify his debate style , common among young earth creationists , as eristic : focused on winning by rhetoric rather than illuminating by careful examination of evidence . in 1993 , hovind announced that he would be debating the renowned evolutionary biologist , stephen jay gould , who had a longstanding opposition to debating creationists and had turned down numerous challenges . when contacted about the announcement , gould said he had never heard of hovind , much less agreed to debate . in may 2004 , michael shermer debated hovind in front of a predominantly creationist audience . shermer claimed the exchange was '' not an intellectual exercise '' , but rather '' an emotional drama , '' and concluded , '' unless there is a subject that is truly debatable with a format that is fair , in a forum that is balanced , it only serves to belittle both the magisterium of science and the magisterium of religion . '' massimo pigliucci also debated hovind , and expressed surprise at hovind 's ignorance of evolutionary theory . pigliucci recalled hovind tried '' to convince the audience that evolutionists believe humans came from rocks '' and subsequently '' evolved from bananas . '' william reville , director of microscopy at university college cork , wrote that hovind 's ideas are not rational or scientific because they are not testable . hovind has repeatedly declined offers for written debates where his claims would be scrutinized by scientists , including his decline of a debate offer from dave thomas . during a debate with farrell till , hovind said that donald johanson had uncovered the leg bones of lucy at a different site over a mile away from the reported site , in a deeper stratum , quipping , '' i would like to know how fast the train was going that hit that chimpanzee . '' reprinted in the reall news 2 ( 2 ) ( march 1994 ) . this was clearly contrary to the published statements by johanson . after hovind had been informed in 1993 that his statement was false , he agreed to stop using the claim . when he repeated the claim in 1995 , he once more agreed he was in error . a version appears as lucy 's knee joint : how creationists deal with their errors in the skeptic 15 ( 4 ) :34–6 ( summer 1995 ) . retrieved 2015-12-03 . . 250,000 offer . in 1990 , hovind made a 10,000 offer to anyone who could meet a set of requirements he said would prove evolution , and he later raised the amount to 250,000 . in 2007 , creation science evangelism removed the offer from its website . the premises of hovind 's offer have been rejected both by scientists and fellow creationists as fundamentally flawed . hovind 's conditions would require a claimant to not only prove the theory of evolution , but also abiogenesis , astrophysics and cosmology , and additionally prove that no gods could possibly exist . the judges would be hand-picked without assurances that they would be unbiased or qualified to assess the merit of claims , and it is possible that no panel was convened when a claim was submitted . some forms of evidence would be excluded prior to judging . answers in genesis dismissed the challenge as a gimmick . a 2005 challenge on boing boing offered 250,000 to anyone who could prove that the flying spaghetti monster ( the deity of a parody religion constructed to make a point about giving time to alternative views on evolution ) was not the father of jesus . . political activity . in 1999 , a bradenton , florida pastor asked the school board to consider adding creationism to the curriculum . the school board chairman 's actions raised issues when , in his capacity as a citizen , he helped fund a series of seminars by hovind , but he was within ethical guidelines . more controversy was raised when a school employee was sent to videotape the lectures , although without intention for rebroadcast . ultimately , there was no curriculum change . hovind was criticized for his involvement with arkansas state representative jim holt 's anti-evolution bill in 2001 ( house bill 2548 ) . don michael , '' the hovind connection : check your facts , legislators . '' northwest arkansas times . april 05 , 2001 this bill '' would have required that when public schools refer to evolution that it be identified as an unproven theory . '' opponents of the bill worried that it would subject arkansas to the same type of derision that occurred when the state 's balanced-treatment law was struck down in mclean v . arkansas . holt called upon hovind as an expert who '' testified for holt before the state agencies and governmental affairs committee , alleging much of the information pertaining to evolution in our science textbooks is false . '' in 2007 , david vitter added a 100,000 earmark in a u.s . senate appropriations bill , directed towards the louisiana family forum '' to develop a plan to promote better science education '' . their website included a document , a battle plan—practical steps to combat evolution ' by kent hovind '' . after a reporter 's inquiries , the document , which called evolution '' not a harmless theory but a dangerous religious belief '' and blamed it for atrocities by adolf hitler , joseph stalin , and pol pot , was removed from their website . the earmark was withdrawn from the bill . . chick tracts . the most widely distributed antievolution work , big daddy ? , was first published in 1972 there may also be a 1970 version . and revised several times ; it is one of the controversial chick tracts , comic strips intended to convert people to fundamentalist christianity . material from hovind was incorporated into the 2000 revision . big daddy ? , tract from chick publications . article from chick publications battle cry july/august 2000 newsletter , author claims some dinosaurs live today ! . politics and conspiracies . hovind has made controversial remarks regarding conspiracies , science , creation , equal rights , religion , and government . his presentations on creationism and evolution are a mix of christian fundamentalism and conspiracy theory . his creationist presentations have asserted that creationism is not taught in public schools due to a new world order conspiracy , established by satan and involving ted turner and jane fonda , the british royal family , the state of israel , the american civil liberties union ( which he calls '' the american communist lawyers union '' ) , u.s . government officials , business leaders , and social activists . in may 1999 , he claimed '' the implementation of the nwo 's world-domination plan was may 5 , 2000 . '' hovind has several conspiracy theories about the u.s . government . he has 9/11 conspiracy theories the 9/11 attacks and the oklahoma city bombing . regarding ufos , hovind recommends books by conspiracy theorists who believe '' some ufo 's are u.s . government experiments with electrogravitic propulsion as opposed to jet propulsion , while others are satanic apparitions . '' '' alberta : evangelist says dinosaurs existed in god 's world , '' the guardian ( charlottetown ) , december 2 , 2000 the southern poverty law center ( splc ) criticized hovind for referring followers to books by irwin schiff , a tax protester who has been convicted of tax evasion multiple times . the splc has criticized hovind for '' pointing his followers to citizens rule book , popular among antigovernment 'patriots ' , and to media bypass , an antigovernment magazine with strong antisemitic leanings '' , and for selling of books such as des griffin 's fourth reich of the rich and peter kershaw 's in caesar 's grip , and recommending the protocols of the elders of zion , a well-known antisemitic hoax . hovind claims that the cyanide-releasing compound laetrile is a '' cancer cure '' which the u.s . government is conspiring to suppress and that diseases including hiv , gulf war syndrome , crohn 's colitis , and rheumatoid arthritis and alzheimer 's were engineered by '' the money masters and governments of the world '' for the purpose of global economic domination . he has denounced democracy as '' evil and contrary to god 's law '' , and called global warming a communist conspiracy . in his lectures , he claimed that the united states government was implanting pet-tracking microchips into people allowing them to be tracked by satellite , even though the transponder range made that impossible . on his website , hovind associated the upc bar code with the mark of the beast , and wrote that there were reports of people paying for groceries by having their hands scanned in 1999 . . youtube copyright controversy . on september 16 , 2007 , the rational response squad complained that creation science evangelism was filing spurious dmca requests that
