The Turbans

when you dance '' . during july 1955 , the turbans had their first herald recording session , and later that month their first record , pairing '' let me show you ( around my heart ) '' as the “ a ” side with “ when you dance '' as the flip side , was released . although '' let me show you '' became a regional hit in atlanta , cleveland pittsburgh , detroit , boston , and new orleans , interest began to grow in '' when you dance '' . at first it started to break in new york city , philadelphia , washington d.c . and baltimore , until finally , in november , it hit the national r & b and pop charts . '' when you dance '' reached 3 on the r & b chart , and remained there for about two months . it only rose to 33 on the pop chart , but stayed there for about five months , so it was counted as a significant hit . late 1955–early 1956 . in december 1955 , herald records released “ sister sooky/i ’ ll always watch over you ” as a follow-up record , but this failed to chart . with one national hit , however , in late january 1956 , they went on a tour , joining irvin feld ’ s '' super attractions tour '' . then in march 1956 , they joined another tour , which featured roy gaines , guitar slim , margie day , and lloyd lambert . they then became part of the '' rhythm and blues show of 1956 , '' and in april 1956 , '' i ’ m nobody ’ s '' / '' b-i-n-g-o '' was released , but this did not make the national charts . by july , they were touring the midwest with sonny boy williamson ’ s orchestra . in august 1956 , '' it was a night like this '' / '' all of my love '' was released , but this record also failed to make the national charts . finally , on october 21 , they played the circle theater in cleveland , with don rello , the quails and ralph wilson ’ s orchestra . 1957 . as 1957 dawned , with no more hit records , the turbans were running out of work . they were back in the studio in early 1957 , but two more sessions failed to produce any hit records . by july 1957 , their contract with herald records expired . this lack of success led to personnel changes , some of which were temporary , some of which were permanent . red top records . in late 1958 , the now-reconstructed turbans signed with red top records . matthew platt and charlie williams had been replaced by earl worsham ( first and second tenor ) and john christian ( baritone/second tenor ) , both of whom had sung with the quadrells . they released a single called '' i promise you '' / '' curfew time . '' again , both sides were led by banks . this record failed to chart , so the turbans did no further recording for about two years . jones left the group for a while , and they continued on as a trio . early 1960s and roulette records . in 1960 , they moved to morris levy ’ s roulette records . jones returned , and they recorded '' diamonds and pearls , '' backed with '' bad man '' . it was a group called the paradons , though , who had a hit with the song . in january 1961 , their second ( and final ) roulette release was '' three friends '' ( written by burt bacharach and hal david ) , backed with '' i ’ m not your fool anymore '' . this again failed to chart . parkway records . the next stop for the turbans was bernie lowe ’ s and kal mann ’ s parkway records . by this time , jones , one of the mainstays of the group , had departed . the group was now al banks , earl worsham , john christian , and newly-added bass , reggie '' tootie '' price . at parkway , they recorded an updated version of '' when you dance , '' released in february 1961 to compete with the re-released original herald version . in the spring of 1960 , the original herald version of '' when you dance '' had been included on the second volume of art laboe ’ s '' oldies but goodies '' album series . it created enough demand for herald to re-release the original single in february 1961 . it was not a big hit the second time around , but it still managed to struggle to 114 on the pop charts . imperial records . later in 1961 , with no chart success at parkway records , they signed with imperial records . price left , and was replaced by james oscar '' cisco '' williams , ( a bass/baritone/tenor ) , who had also been with the quadrells . the group was now a quintet , with the fifth member being tenor sonny gordon , who had been the lead of the angels in 1954 . their first imperial release was '' six questions '' ( led by banks ) , backed with '' the lament of silver gulch '' . in march 1962 , there was a second imperial release , '' this is my story '' / '' clicky clicky clack , '' both sides featuring banks . the final turbans ’ record appeared in may 1962 : '' i wonder '' / '' the damage is done , '' with sonny gordon taking the lead on both sides . none of these three releases charted . the turbans break up . after imperial , the turbans broke up for good . worsham went off to billy byrd 's ink spots , but now sings with a coasters group based in boca raton . banks was with charlie thomas ' drifters in the early 1970s , but he and john christian have since died . discography . source : ; singles under herald label '' when you dance '' ( 1955 ) '' sister sookey '' ( 1955 ) '' b-i-n-g-o ( bingo ) '' ( 1956 ) - a doo-wop song written by robert riley , based on the bingo ( u.s . ) game , 1956 , also sung by pat boone '' i 'm nobody 's '' ( 1956 ) '' it was a nite like this '' ( 1956 ) '' valley of love '' ( 1957 ) '' congratulations '' ( 1957 ) '' when you dance '' ( 1961 ) ; singles under other labels '' promise you love '' ( red top , 1958 ) '' diamonds and pearls '' ( roulette , 1960 ) '' three friends '' ( roulette , 1961 ) '' golden rings '' ( parkway , 1961 ) '' six questions '' ( imperial , 1961 ) '' this is my story '' ( imperial , 1962 ) '' i wonder '' ( imperial , 1962 ) ; compilation albums . references . external links . marv goldberg 's r & b note books - the turbans
