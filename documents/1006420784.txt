Consumer electronics

trends . one overriding characteristic of consumer electronic products is the trend of ever-falling prices . this is driven by gains in manufacturing efficiency and automation , lower labor costs as manufacturing has moved to lower-wage countries , and improvements in semiconductor design . semiconductor components benefit from moore 's law , an observed principle which states that , for a given price , semiconductor functionality doubles every two years . while consumer electronics continues in its trend of convergence , combining elements of many products , consumers face different decisions when purchasing . there is an ever-increasing need to keep product information updated and comparable , for the consumer to make an informed choice . style , price , specification , and performance are all relevant . there is a gradual shift towards e-commerce web-storefronts . many products include internet connectivity using technologies such as wi-fi , bluetooth , edge , or ethernet . products not traditionally associated with computer use ( such as tvs or hi-fi equipment ) now provide options to connect to the internet or to a computer using a home network to provide access to digital content . the desire for high-definition ( hd ) content has led the industry to develop a number of technologies , such as wirelesshd or itu-t g.hn , which are optimized for distribution of hd content between consumer electronic devices in a home . industries . the electronics industry , especially meaning consumer electronics , emerged in the 20th century and has now become a global industry worth billions of dollars . contemporary society uses all manner of electronic devices built in automated or semi-automated factories operated by the industry . manufacturing . most consumer electronics are built in china , due to maintenance cost , availability of materials , quality , and speed as opposed to other countries such as the united states . cities such as shenzhen have become important production centres for the industry , attracting many consumer electronics companies such as apple inc . . electronic component . an electronic component is any basic discrete device or physical entity in an electronic system used to affect electrons or their associated fields . electronic components are mostly industrial products , available in a singular form and are not to be confused with electrical elements , which are conceptual abstractions representing idealized electronic components . software development . consumer electronics such as personal computers use various types of software . embedded software is used within some consumer electronics , such as mobile phones . this type of software may be embedded within the hardware of electronic devices . some consumer electronics include software that is used on a personal computer in conjunction with electronic devices , such as camcorders and digital cameras , and third-party software for such devices also exists . standardization . some consumer electronics adhere to protocols , such as connection protocols '' to high speed bi-directional signals '' . in telecommunications , a communications protocol is a system of digital rules for data exchange within or between computers . trade shows . the consumer electronics show ( ces ) trade show has taken place yearly in las vegas , nevada since its foundation in 1973 . the event , which grew from having 100 exhibitors in its inaugural year to more than 4,500 exhibiting companies in its 2020 edition , features the latest in consumer electronics , speeches by industry experts and innovation awards . the internationale funkausstellung berlin ( ifa ) trade show has taken place berlin , germany since its foundation in 1924 . the event features new consumer electronics and speeches by industry pioneers . ieee initiatives . institute of electrical and electronics engineers ( ieee ) , the world 's largest professional society , has many initiatives to advance the state of the art of consumer electronics . ieee has a dedicated society of thousands of professionals to promote ce , called the ieee consumer electronics society . ieee consumer electronics society , ieee has multiple periodicals and international conferences to promote ce and encourage collaborative research and development in ce . the flagship conference of cesoc , called ieee international conference on consumer electronics ( icce ) , is on its 35th year . ieee transactions on consumer electronics simon sherratt , editor-in-chief ( eic ) , ieee transactions on consumer electronics , . ieee consumer electronics magazine saraju mohanty , editor-in-chief ( eic ) , ieee consumer electronics magazine , . ieee international conference on consumer electronics ( icce ) ieee international conference on consumer electronics ( icce ) , . retailing . electronics retailing is a significant part of the retail industry in many countries . in the united states , dedicated consumer electronics stores have mostly given way to big-box retailers such as best buy , the largest consumer electronics retailer in the country , although smaller dedicated stores include apple stores , and specialist stores that serve , for example , audiophiles and exceptions , such as the single-branch b & h photo store in new york city . broad-based retailers , such as walmart and target , also sell consumer electronics in many of their stores . in april 2014 , retail e-commerce sales were the highest in the consumer electronic and computer categories as well . some consumer electronics retailers offer extended warranty on products with programs such as squaretrade . an electronics district is an area of commerce with a high density of retail stores that sell consumer electronics . . service and repair . consumer electronic service can refer to the maintenance of said products . when consumer electronics have malfunctions , they may sometimes be repaired . in 2013 , in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , the increased popularity in listening to sound from analog audio devices , such as record players , as opposed to digital sound , has sparked a noticeable increase of business for the electronic repair industry there . . mobile phone industry . . by country . environmental impact . in 2017 , the greenpeace usa published a study of 17 of the world ’ s leading consumer electronics companies in relation to their energy and resource consumption and the use of chemicals . guide to greener electronics 2017 greenpeace usa , 2017 . rare metals and rare earth elements . electronic devices use thousands rare metals and rare-earth element ( 40 on average for a smartphone ) , these material are extracted and refined using water and energy-intensive processes . these metals are also used in the renewable energy industry meaning that consumer electronics are directly competing for the raw materials . . energy consumption . the energy consumption of consumer electronics and their environmental impact , either from their production processes or the disposal of the devices , is increasing steadily . eia estimates that electronic devices and gadgets account for about 10 % –15 % of the energy use in american homes – largely because of their number ; the average house has dozens of electronic devices . '' heating and cooling no longer majority of us home energy use '' . eia.gov the energy consumption of consumer electronics increases – in america and europe – to about 50 % of household consumption , if the term is redefined to include home appliances such as refrigerators , dryers , clothes washers and dishwashers . standby power . standby power – used by consumer electronics and appliances while they are turned off – accounts for 5–10 % of total household energy consumption , costing 100 annually to the average household in the united states . a study by united states department of energy 's berkeley lab found that a videocassette recorders ( vcrs ) consume more electricity during the course of a year in standby mode than when they are used to record or playback videos . similar findings were obtained concerning set-top box , which consume almost the same amount of energy in '' on '' and '' off '' modes . a 2012 study in the united kingdom , carried out by the energy saving trust , found that the devices using the most power on standby mode included televisions , satellite boxes and other video and audio equipment . the study concluded that uk households could save up to £86 per year by switching devices off instead of using standby mode . a report from the international energy agency in 2014 found that 80 billion of power is wasted globally per year due to inefficiency of electronic devices . consumers can reduce unwanted use of standby power by unplugging their devices , using power strips with switches , or by buying devices that are standardized for better energy management , particularly energy star marked products . . electronic waste . a high number of different metals and low concentration rates in electronics means that recycling is limited and energy intensive . electronic waste describes discarded electrical or electronic devices . many consumer electronics may contain toxic minerals and elements , and many electronic scrap components , such as crts , may contain contaminants such as lead , cadmium , beryllium , mercury , dioxins , or brominated flame retardants . electronic waste recycling may involve significant risk to workers and communities and great care must be taken to avoid unsafe exposure in recycling operations and leaking of materials such as heavy metals from landfills and incinerator ashes . however , large amounts of the produced electronic waste from developed countries is exported , and handled by the informal sector in countries like india , despite the fact that exporting electronic waste to them is illegal . strong informal sector can be a problem for the safe and clean recycling . reuse and repair e-waste policy has gone through various incarnations since the 1970s , with emphases changing as the decades passed . more weight was gradually placed on the need to dispose of e-waste more carefully due to the toxic materials it may contain . there has also been recognition that various valuable metals and plastics from waste electrical equipment can be recycled for other uses . more recently the desirability of reusing whole appliances has been foregrounded in the ‘ preparation for reuse ’ guidelines . the policy focus is slowly moving towards a potential shift in attitudes to reuse and repair . with turnover of small household appliances high and costs relatively low , many consumers will throw unwanted electric goods in the normal dustbin , meaning that items of potentially high reuse or recycling value go to landfills . while larger items such as washing machines are usually collected , it has been estimated that the 160,000 tonnes of eee in regular waste collections was worth £220 million . and 23 % of eee taken to household waste recycling centres was immediately resaleable – or would be with minor repairs or refurbishment . this indicates a lack of awareness among consumers as to where and how to dispose of eee , and of the potential value of things that are literally going in the bin . for reuse and repair of electrical goods to increase substantially in the uk there are barriers that must be overcome . these include people ’ s mistrust of used equipment in terms of whether it will be functional , safe , and the stigma for some of owning second-hand goods . but the benefits of reuse could allow lower income households access to previously unaffordable technology whilst helping the environment at the same time . . health impact . desktop monitors and laptops produce major physical health concerns for humans when bodies are forced into positions that are unhealthy and uncomfortable in order to see the screen better . from this , neck and back pains and problems increase , commonly referred to as repetitive strain injuries . using electronics before going to bed makes it difficult for people to fall asleep , which has a negative effect on human health . sleeping less prevents people from performing to their full potential physically and mentally and can also “ increase rates of obesity and diabetes , ” which are “ long-term health consequences ” . obesity and diabetes are more commonly seen in students and in youth because they tend to be the ones using electronics the most . “ people who frequently use their thumbs to type text messages on cell phones can develop a painful affliction called de quervain syndrome that affects their tendons on their hands . the best known disease in this category is called carpal tunnel syndrome , which results from pressure on the median nerve in the wrist ” . . see also . digital
