Count palatine

importance of a count palatine in medieval europe . comes palatinus . this latin title is the original , but also pre-feudal : it originated as a roman comes , which was a non-hereditary court title of high rank , the specific part palatinus being the adjective derived from palatium ( 'palace ' ) . after the fall of rome , a new feudal type of title , also known simply as palatinus , started developing . the franks kings of the merovingian dynasty ( reigned 480–750 ) employed a high official , the comes palatinus , who at first assisted the king in his judicial duties and at a later date discharged many of these himself . other counts palatine were employed on military and administrative work . in the visigothic kingdom , the officium palatinum consisted of a number of men with the title of count who managed the various departments of the royal household . the comes cubiculariorum oversaw the chamberlains , the comes scanciorun directed the cup-bearers , the comes stabulorum directed the equerries in charge of the stables , etc . the ostrogothic kingdom also maintained palatine counts with titles such as comes patrimonium , who was in charge of the patrimonial or private real estate of the king , and others . the system was maintained by the carolingian sovereigns ( reigned 751–987 ) . a frankish capitulary of 882 and hincmar , writing about the same time , testify to the extent to which the judicial work of the frankish empire had passed into their hands , and one grant of power was followed by another . ( see the twelve legendary paladins . ) instead of remaining near the person of the king , some of the counts palatine were sent to various parts of his empire to act as judges and governors , the districts ruled by them being called palatinates . being in a special sense the representatives of the sovereign , they were entrusted with more extended power than the ordinary counts . in this way came about the later and more general use of the word '' palatine '' , its application as an adjective to persons entrusted with special powers—but also to the districts over which these powers were exercised . by the high middle ages , the title '' count '' had become increasingly common , to the point that both great magnates who ruled regions that were the size of duchies , and local castle-lords , might style themselves '' count . '' as the great magnates began to centralize their power over their local castle-lords , they felt the need to assert the difference between themselves and these minor '' counts . '' therefore , several of these great magnates began styling themselves '' count palatine , '' signifying great counts ruling regions equivalent to duchies , such as the counts of champagne in the 13th century . see also royal administration of merovingian and carolingian dynasties . related titles . in early medieval poland , the palatinus was next in rank to the king . as he is also the chief commander of the king 's army the rank is merged with voivode , with the latter replacing the title of palatine . during the fragmentation of poland each prince would have his own voivode . when some of these principalities are reunited into the kingdom of poland the palatines are infeudated with them as there is no local prince anymore . or rather on behalf of the king to whom all these princely titles returned . the principalities are thus made voivodships ( sometimes translated as palatinates ) . in the polish–lithuanian commonwealth the voivodes sit in the senat . throughout its history the dignity remained non-hereditary or semi-hereditary . today voivodes are government officials . as successor to the byzantine empire after the fall of constantinople in 1453 , the ottoman sultan also claimed the right to bestow the office . thus giovanni bellini was named comes palatinus by emperor frederick iii in 1469 and later again in 1481 by sultan mehmet ii . grand čelnik ( велики челник ) . babinger 1992 , p . 147 : '' the '' grand celnik '' ( a sort of count palatine ) '' the grand čelnik was the highest court title of the serbian despotate , and the title-holders held great provinces , property , and honours , and radič ( fl . 1413–1441 ) was one of the most powerful ones . trifunović 1979 , p . 61 : '' међу њима је највиши углед уживао велики челник ( xребељан , радич поступовић и др . ) . неки од њих су временом стекли велике области , имања и почасти . занимљив је и жив пример челника радича '' hungary in the middle ages : nádorispán or nádor ( see palatine of hungary ) the term count palatine was not used in the united kingdom . just as count always remained reserved for continental territories , even though the equivalence of earl became clear by rendering it in latin also as comes , earl palatine was the exclusively british title for the incumbent of a british county palatine . merovingian and carolingian counts palatine . robertians . chrodobertus ii , was named on 2 october 678 grimbert , probably son of chrodobertus ii , was of neustria from 691 to 720 robert i ( also known as rupert i ; d . before 764 ) , grandson of chrodobertus ii , was around 741/742 anselm ( d . 778 in roncesvalles ) , son of robert adalard , was in 877 cobbo the younger see also royal administration of merovingian and carolingian dynasties . counts palatine of champagne . king lothar of france ( 954–986 ) gave odo i , count of blois , one of his most loyal supporters in the struggle against the robertians and the counts of vermandois , in 976 the title of count palatine . the title was later inherited by his heirs , and when they died out , by the counts of champagne . holy roman empire . pfalzgraf ( old high german phalanzgrāvo ) is the german equivalent of the title , graf being the german term for '' count '' or '' earl '' , and pfalz being the german reflex of latin palatium . the german title has also been rendered as palsgrave in english ( recorded 1548 ) . counts palatine were the permanent representatives of the franks king , later of the holy roman emperor , in a county palatine of the crown . there were dozens of these royal pfalzen throughout the early empire , and the emperor would travel between them , as there was no imperial capital . in the empire , the word count palatine was also used to designate the officials who assisted the emperor in exercising the rights which were reserved for his personal consideration , like granting arms . they were called imperial counts palatine ( in latin comites palatini caesarii , or comites sacri palatii ; in german , hofpfalzgrafen ) . both the latin form ( comes ) palatinus and the french ( comte ) palatin have been used as part of the full title of the dukes of burgundy ( a branch of the french royal dynasty ) to render their rare german title freigraf , which was the style of a ( later lost ) bordering principality , the allodium countship of burgundy ( freigrafschaft burgund in german ) which came to be known as franche-comté . during the 11th century , some imperial palatine counts became a valuable political counterweight against the mighty duchies . surviving old palatine counties were turned into new institutional pillars through which the imperial authority could be exercised . by the reigns of henry the fowler and especially of otto the great , comites palatini were sent into all parts of the country to support the royal authority by checking the independent tendencies of the great tribal dukes . apparent thereafter was the existence of a count palatine in saxony , and of others in lorraine , in bavaria and in swabia , their duties being to administer the royal estates in these duchies . next to the dukes of lotharingia , bavaria , swabia and saxony , who had become dangerously powerful feudal princes , loyal supporters of the german emperor were installed as counts palatine . the lotharingian palatines out of the ezzonids dynasty were important commanders of the imperial army and were often employed during internal and external conflicts ( e.g . to suppress rebelling counts or dukes , to settle frontier disputes with the hungarian and the french kingdom and to lead imperial campaigns ) . although a palatinate could be rooted for decades into one dynasty , the office of the palatine counts became hereditary only during the 12th century . during the 11th century the palatinates were still regarded as beneficia , non-hereditary fiefs . the count palatine in bavaria , an office held by the family of wittelsbach , became duke of this land , the lower comital title being then merged into the higher ducal one . the count palatine of lotharingia changed his name to count palatine of the rhine in 1085 , alone remaining independent until 1777 . the office having become hereditary , pfalzgrafen were in existence until the dissolution of the holy roman empire in 1806 . the palatinate of saxony merged with the electoral duchy of saxony . the palatinate of the rhine became an electorate , and both were imperial vicars . counts palatine of bavaria . originally , the counts palatine held the county palatine ( around regensburg ) , and were subordinate to the dukes of bavaria , rather than to the king . the position gave its holder a leading position in the legal system of the duchy . meginhard i , count palatine of bavaria in 883 arnulf ii ( d . 954 ) , son of duke arnulf i of bavaria , constructed scheyern abbey around 940 berthold ( d . 999 ) , son of arnulf ii , count palatine of bavaria between 954 and 976 with interruptions , ancestor of the counts of andechs hartwig i ( d . 985 ) , count palatine of bavaria from 977 until his death aribo i ( d . , son-in-law of hartwig i , count palatine of bavaria from 985 until his death hartwig ii ( d . 1027 ) , son of aribo i , count palatine of bavaria from 1020 to 1026 aribo ii ( d . 1102 ) , son of hartwig ii , count palatine of bavaria from 1026 to 1055 kuno i ( d . , count palatine of bavaria rapoto i ( d . 1099 ) , count palatine of bavaria from to 1093 engelbert i ( d . 1122 ) , nephew of both of aribo ii 's wives , count palatine of bavaria from 1099 to 1120 otto iv & ndash ;
