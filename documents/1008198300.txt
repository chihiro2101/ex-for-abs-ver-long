Hobgoblin (comics)

publication history . the hobgoblin was created by writer roger stern and artist john romita jr . for the amazing spider-man 238 ( march 1983 ) . like other writers , stern found himself under pressure to have spider-man fight the green goblin again , but did not wish to bring norman osborn or bart hamilton back from the dead , have harry osborn be the green goblin again , or create yet another green goblin . stern instead created a new concept as heir to the goblin legacy and developed the hobgoblin . stern recounts that he directed romita to base the costume on the green goblin 's but to make it '' a little more medieval-looking '' , while romita asserts that he was given no direction beyond using the green goblin as a basis . both agree , however , that the costume was chiefly romita 's design . the hobgoblin 's identity was not initially revealed , generating one of the longest-running mysteries in the spider-man comics . according to stern , '' i plotted that first story with no strong idea of who the hobgoblin was . as i was scripting those gorgeous pages from jr john romita , jr . , particularly the last third of the book , and developing the hobgoblin â€™ s speech pattern , i realized who he was . it was roderick kingsley , that sunuvabitch corporate leader i had introduced in my first issue of the spectacular spider-man the spectacular spider-man . '' a handful of readers deduced that kingsley was the hobgoblin almost immediately . in order to throw off the scent and in the same stroke provide a retroactive continuity for his inconsistent characterization of kingsley in his early appearances , stern came up with the idea of kingsley having his brother daniel kingsley sometimes impersonate him , sealing the deception by having the hobgoblin conspicuously appear in the same room as kingsley in amazing spider-man 249 . stern 's original plan was to have the hobgoblin 's mystery identity run exactly one issue longer than that of the green goblin 's identity , meaning the truth would be revealed in the amazing spider-man 264 . however , stern left after the amazing spider-man 251 , and editor tom defalco took his place . wanting to resolve the mystery in a manner that would do justice to stern 's stories , defalco asked stern who the hobgoblin was , but objected when stern said it was kingsley . defalco argued that the '' twin brother '' scheme was cheating the readers since there had been no hint that roderick even had a brother ( aside from a single thought bubble ) , much less one who could serve as a body double . stern disagreed but said that defalco should feel free to choose whoever defalco wanted for the hobgoblin 's secret identity , reasoning that '' i knew that whomever tom chose , he would make it work . '' upon reviewing the clues , defalco decided that the hobgoblin was richard fisk . moreover , he decided that the hobgoblin 's mystery should be prolonged as long as possible , since it was the chief element that made the hobgoblin interesting . through both stern and defalco 's runs , mystery answer was continuously teased on the cover art , with the covers of amazing spider-man 245 , 251 , and 276 all showing spider-man unmasking the hobgoblin . the mystery was further complicated after james owsley came on as editor of the spider-man titles . owsley 's relationship with defalco and artist ron frenz was strained from the beginning . when owsley asked who the hobgoblin was at a creators conference , defalco lied and said the man in question was ned leeds . owsley then wrote the one-shot spider-man vs wolverine in which leeds is killed off ( though the actual death is not shown ) , and instructed the spectacular spider-man writer peter david to reveal the hobgoblin 's identity as the foreigner . david objected and argued that the only person who fit the clues was leeds ; having been present at the spider-man creator 's conference , david also thought that leeds was who defalco intended it to be . because spider-man vs . wolverine had already been drawn , however , it was too late to undo leeds 's death . thus , the hobgoblin 's identity was revealed posthumously in the amazing spider-man 289 ( a double-sized issue ) . with spider-man 's archenemy now dead , a new storyline was created from jason macendale 's hatred of the hobgoblin . though the hobgoblin 's posthumous unmasking as leeds was unpopular with fans , david said in a 2009 interview of still being proud of the story , arguing that the hobgoblin being unmasked in a climactic battle with spider-man was the sort of tale readers had already seen countless times before , whereas having an archvillain unmasked in a flashback after having been brutally killed by nameless assassins was unprecedented and shocking . from 1987 to 1997 , macendale initially wielded only the hobgoblin 's weaponry but the 1988-1989 inferno crossover writer gerry conway had macendale imbued with demonic powers by n'astirh . in addition to power over hellfire and increased strength and speed to far greater than that of the original hobgoblin , these powers also disfigure macendale so that his head is even more grotesque than the hobgoblin mask , and ultimately alters his mind so that he was deluded into thinking that his appearance is normal . several years later , macendale succeeds in purging himself of his demonic powers and was later revamped again with cybernetic implants . stern was unhappy with the hobgoblin 's civilian identity revelation was leeds and wrote the three-issue miniseries spider-man : hobgoblin lives in 1997 , with the retcon that kingsley was the original hobgoblin while leeds was brainwashed into serving as a fall guy , macendale is killed off , and kingsley returned . according to stern , initially he had not known how to resolve the situation of having two hobgoblins , and it was at the suggestion of the editorial staff that kingsley kill macendale and return to operating as the hobgoblin . . fictional character biography . roderick kingsley . roderick kingsley is an egotistical socialite and billionaire fashion designer . he decided
