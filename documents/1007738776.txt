history . a settlement existed at kenilworth by the time of the 1086 domesday book , which records it as chinewrde , meaning '' farm of a woman named cynehild '' . geoffrey de clinton ( died 1134 ) initiated the building of an augustinian priory in 1122 , which coincided with his initiation of kenilworth castle . english heritage . retrieved 10 november 2018 . the priory was raised to the rank of an abbey in 1450 and suppressed with the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s . thereafter , the abbey grounds next to the castle were made common land in exchange for what robert dudley , 1st earl of leicester used to enlarge the castle . only a few walls and a storage barn of the original abbey survive . just off coventry road in kenilworth is a field called parliament piece . this may be where henry iii held a parliament in august 1266 , while his troops besieged kenilworth castle , where the late simon de montfort 's followers , led by henry de hastings , were still holding out against the king 's forces . this parliament led to the dictum of kenilworth : a settlement that offered the rebels a way of recovering the lands that the crown had seized from them . one copy of the dictum is endorsed in castris apud kenilworth — '' in the camp ( or castle ) at kenilworth '' . members of the public have free access to parliament piece , which is owned by the open spaces society and leased to warwick ( district ) . geoffrey de clinton had a deer park created near kenilworth . in 1488 ralph , abbot of kenilworth abbey had of land near redfern , north-west of the town , emparked as duck park , which despite its name was a deer park . by about 1540 there were eight deer parks near kenilworth . another near rudfen was a park that was called little park in 1581 . it was owned by robert briscoe in 1649 and was still called briscoe 's park in 1785 . one of the eight deer parks , the chase , can still be traced . the eastern part of its park pale is about west of the castle , while the northern part forms the boundary between chase wood and the farm road and bridleway between little chase farm and warrior 's lodge farm . in about 1414 henry v had le plesans en marais — '' the pleasaunce in the marsh '' — built about west of the castle . this was a timber-framed banqueting house surrounded by a moated earthwork about by , which 15th-century kings used instead of the castle 's state apartments . in the 16th century , henry viii had the banqueting house demolished and the materials reused for timber-framed buildings inside the castle . the mere was drained in 1649 , but '' the pleasaunce '' earthworks survive as a scheduled monument . elizabeth i visited robert dudley , 1st earl of leicester at kenilworth castle several times , the last in 1575

the town had some fine large mansions with landscaped gardens ; these were demolished after the world war i and world war ii for housing developments . the names of them survive in the names of some roads and areas . for example , towers close was built on the grounds of rouncil towers . some large trees from their grounds survive , including giant sequoias from the moorlands and rouncil towers . the town 's growth occasioned the addition of a second church of england parish church , st john 's , which is on warwick road in knights meadow . it was designed by ewan christian and built in

forming hillcrest , the west wing with the main grand staircase and gardens max gate , and the billiard room the bungalow south brent . the old landscaped gardens to the east and west of the property
