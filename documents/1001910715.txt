Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery

founding . valhalla was founded in 1923 by two los angeles financiers , john r . osborne and c . c . fitzpatrick . the spanish mission revival entrance structure was designed by architect kenneth mcdonald jr . for the decorative stone castings , mcdonald hired italian-born sculptor federico a . giorgi , who had created statues of elephants and lions for the 1916 epic film intolerance , and helped to craft the exterior of downtown 's million dollar theater . the gateway to the new cemetery cost 140,000 . the rotunda was dedicated march 1 , 1925 , with a concert by english contralto maude elliott . picnickers spread blankets on the surrounding grassy expanse between three reflecting pools and flat cemetery markers , which were a new concept at the time . it became a tourist attraction and was used for concerts that were broadcast over radio station kelw by station owner earl l . white . just five months after the dedication , osborne and fitzpatrick were convicted of fraud . they had sold the same burial plots repeatedly—as many as 16 times—and netted a profit of 3–4 million , according to los angeles times stories of the era . they were fined 12,000 each and sentenced to 10 years in prison but served less than three years . . state control . left the cemetery was taken over by the state of california . it is unclear how long the state owned the cemetery , but pierce brothers bought it in 1950 and , within two years , closed the rotunda to vehicle traffic and moved the entry to the cemetery from valhalla drive in burbank to victory and cahuenga boulevards in north hollywood . there , they opened a two-story office building and mortuary . on december 17 , 1953—the 50th anniversary of orville and wilbur wright 's 12-second powered hop at kitty hawk—the rotunda was rededicated as the portal of the folded wings , through the efforts of aviation fan and cemetery employee james gillette . during the ceremony , the cremated remains of walter r . brookins , the first aviator to take a plane to an altitude of a mile and the wright brothers ' first civilian student , were interred . when sculptor giorgi died in 1963 , he was buried outside the structure , near his masterpiece . gillette was also buried outside , near the shrine he helped found . earthquake . the cube-like shrine building was heavily damaged in the 1994 northridge earthquake but restored and rededicated in 1996 . two years later , it was placed on the national register of historic places . sale of property . right in 1958 , pierce brothers sold its family-owned chain of southern california mortuaries and cemeteries to texas financier joe allbritton , who sold of valhalla for development . in 1991 , the cemeteries and mortuaries were acquired by service corp . international of houston , but the pierce brothers sign remains at valhalla . pioneers ' resting place . beneath the memorial tablets rest the remains of other aviation pioneers , including : augustus roy knabenshue ( 1876–1960 ) , who in 1904 became america 's first dirigible pilot . he also founded a dirigible passenger service , from pasadena to los angeles , in 1912 . bobbi trout ( 1906–2003 ) , who held

in 1918 . hilder florentina smith ( 1890–1977 ) , who became a parachute jumper in 1914 . two years later , she became the first female pilot to fly out of the bean patch that later became los angeles international airport . she was married to james floyd smith . matilde moisant , the second american woman to earn her pilot certificate—two days after her friend , journalist harriet quimby . in 1911 , moisant let quimby be first , because quimby needed the extra acclaim : she wrote about air races and the thrill of flight . john b . moisant ( 1868–1910 ) , who designed and built the first metal plane . matilde moisant was his sister . notable burials . note : this is a partial list . use the following alphabetical links to find a name . a . fred abbott ( 1874–1935 ) , major league baseball
