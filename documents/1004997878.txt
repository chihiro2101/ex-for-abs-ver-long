Arno Schmidt

biography . born in hamburg , the son of a police constable , schmidt moved in 1928 , after the death of his father ( 1883-1928 ) , with his mother ( 1894-1973 ) , to her hometown of lauban ( in lusatia , then lower silesia , now poland ) and attended secondary school in görlitz as well as a trade school there . after finishing school , he was unemployed for some months and then , in 1934 , began a commercial apprenticeship at a textile company in greiffenberg . after finishing his apprenticeship he was hired by the same company as a stock accountant . around this time , at his company , he met his future wife , alice murawski . the couple married on 21 august 1937 ; they had no children . at the outset of world war ii , in 1939 , schmidt was drafted into the wehrmacht , where his mathematical skills led him to be assigned to the artillery corps . he first served in alsace and after 1941 in fairly quiet norway . in 1945 , schmidt volunteered for active front duty in northern germany , in order to be granted a brief home visit . as the war was obviously lost , he used this visit to organise his wife 's and his own escape to the west of germany , in order to evade capture by the red army , which was known for its much harsher treatment of prisoners of war and german civilians . schmidt gave himself up to british forces in lower saxony . as refugees , schmidt and his wife lost almost all of their possessions , including their cherished book collection . after an interlude as an english pow and later as an interpreter at a police school , schmidt began his career as a freelance writer in 1946 . since schmidt 's pre-war home in lauban was now under polish administration , schmidt and his wife were among the millions of refugees moved by the authorities to numerous places in what was to become west germany . during this time of uncertainty and extreme poverty , the schmidts were sustained by care packages his sister sent them from the us ( his sister lucie had emigrated to the us in 1939 , together with her husband rudy kiesler , a jewish german communist ) . temporary accommodations led the schmidts to cordingen ( near bomlitz ) , gau-bickelheim , and kastel ( the latter two in the newly formed state of rhineland-palatinate ) . in kastel , he was accused in court of blasphemy and moral subversion , then still considered a crime in some of the catholic regions of germany . as a result , schmidt and his wife moved to the protestant city of darmstadt in hesse , where the suit against him was dismissed . in 1958 , the schmidts moved to the small village of bargfeld , where they were to stay for the rest of their lives , schmidt dying in 1979 , his wife alice in 1983 . writing style and personal philosophy . schmidt was a strict individualist , almost a solipsist . disaffected by his experience of the third reich , he had an extremely pessimistic world view . in schwarze spiegel ( black mirrors ) , he describes his utopia as an empty world after an anthropogenic apocalypse . although he was not a deist in the conventional sense , he maintained that the world was created by a monster called leviathan , whose predatory nature was passed on to humans . still , he thought this monster could not be too powerful to be attacked , if it behooved humanity . his writing style is characterized by a unique and witty style of adapting colloquial language , which won him quite a few fervent admirers . moreover , he developed an orthography by which he thought to reveal the true meaning of words and their connections amongst each other . one of the most cited examples is the use of “ roh mann tick '' instead of '' romantik '' ( revealing romanticism as the craze of unsubtle men ) . the atoms of words holding the nuclei of original meaning he called etyme ( etyms ) . zettel 's dream . his theory of etyms is developed in his masterpiece , zettels traum , in which an elderly writer comments on edgar allan poe 's works in a stream of consciousness , while discussing a poe translation with a couple of translators and flirting with their teenage daughter . schmidt also accomplished a translation of edgar allan poe 's works himself ( 1966–1973 , together with hans wollschläger ) . some critics even dismissed zettel 's traum as non-art , or sheer nonsense , and schmidt himself as a '' psychopath . '' but schmidt 's reputation as esoteric , and that of his work as non-art , has faded and he is now seen as an important , if highly eccentric , german writer of the 20th century . arno schmidt 's zettel 's traum : an analysis by volker max langbehn , 2003 , page 4 . other , minor works . in the 1960s , he authored a series of plays for german radio stations presenting forgotten or little known and—in his opinion—vastly underrated authors , e.g . johann gottfried schnabel , karl philipp moritz , leopold schefer , karl ferdinand gutzkow , and others . these '' plays '' are basically talks about literature with two or three participants plus voices for quotations ( schmidt lent his voice for his translations of finnegans wake quoted in der triton mit dem sonnenschirm 1961 ) . eleven of these so-called '' radio-essays '' were republished on 12 audio cds in the year 2003 . the final years . as none of his works sold more than a few thousand copies ( schmidt openly admitted that he only wrote for the small handful of people who could appreciate his work ) , he lived in extreme poverty . during the last few years of his life , arno schmidt was financially supported by the philologist and writer jan philipp reemtsma , the heir of the german cigarette manufacturer philipp f . reemtsma . schmidt 's final completed novel was abend mit goldrand ( 1975 ) which was praised by some critics for its verbal inventiveness , although many had a difficult time digesting the erotic themes of the book . he died in a hospital in celle on 3 june 1979 after suffering a stroke . posthumous legacy . dalkey archive press has reissued five volumes of schmidt 's work translated by john e . woods . the series includes collected novellas , collected stories , nobodaddy 's children , two novels , and most recently , bottom ’ s dream ( zettel ’ s traum ) . the reissues were scheduled to coincide with '' rediscovering arno schmidt events in the us , uk , and continental europe .
