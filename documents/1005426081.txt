Annibale Carracci

early career . annibale carracci was born in bologna , and in all likelihood was first apprenticed within his family . in 1582 , annibale , his brother agostino and his cousin ludovico carracci opened a painters ' studio , initially called by some the academy of the desiderosi ( desirous of fame and learning ) and subsequently the incamminati ( progressives ; literally '' of those opening a new way '' ) . while the carraccis laid emphasis on the typically florence linear draftsmanship , as exemplified by raphael and andrea del sarto , their interest in the glimmering colours and mistier edges of objects derived from the venice painters , notably the works of venetian oil painter titian , which annibale and agostino studied during their travels around italy in 1580–81 at the behest of the elder caracci lodovico . this eclecticism was to become the defining trait of the artists of the baroque emilian or bolognese school . in many early bolognese works by the carraccis , it is difficult to distinguish the individual contributions made by each . for example , the frescoes on the story of jason for palazzo fava in bologna ( c . 1583–84 ) are signed carracci , which suggests that they all contributed . in 1585 , annibale completed an altarpiece of the baptism of christ for the church of santi gregorio e siro in bologna . in 1587 , he painted the assumption for the church of san rocco in reggio emilia . in 1587–88 , annibale is known to have had travelled to parma and then venice , where he joined his brother agostino . from 1589 to 1592 , the three carracci brothers completed the frescoes on the founding of rome for palazzo magnani in bologna . by 1593 , annibale had completed an altarpiece , virgin on the throne with st john and st catherine , in collaboration with lucio massari . his resurrection of christ also dates from 1593 . in 1592 , he painted an assumption for the bonasoni chapel in san francesco . during 1593–94 , all three carraccis were working on frescoes in palazzo sampieri in bologna . frescoes in palazzo farnese . based on the prolific and masterful frescoes by the carracci in bologna , annibale was recommended by the duke of parma , ranuccio i farnese , to his brother , the cardinal odoardo farnese , who wished to decorate the piano nobile of the cavernous roman palazzo farnese . in november–december 1595 , annibale and agostino traveled to rome to begin decorating the camerino with stories of hercules , appropriate since the room housed the famous greco-roman antique sculpture of the hypermuscular farnese hercules . annibale meanwhile developed hundreds of preparatory sketches for the major work , wherein he led a team painting frescoes on the ceiling of the grand salon with the secular quadro riportato of the loves of the gods , or as the biographer giovanni bellori described it , human love governed by celestial love . although the ceiling is riotously rich in illusionistic elements , the narratives are framed in the restrained classicism of high renaissance decoration , drawing inspiration from , yet more immediate and intimate , than michelangelo 's sistine chapel as well as raphael 's vatican logge and villa farnesina frescoes . his work would later inspire the untrammelled stream of baroque illusionism and energy that would emerge in the grand frescoes of cortona , lanfranco , and in later decades andrea pozzo and gaulli . throughout the 17th and 18th centuries , the farnese ceiling was considered the unrivaled masterpiece of fresco painting for its age . they were not only seen as a pattern book of heroic figure design , but also as a model of technical procedure ; annibale 's hundreds of preparatory drawings for the ceiling became a fundamental step in composing any ambitious history painting . contrast with caravaggio . image : domine , quo vadis ? . jpg thumb carracci 's domine quo vadis ? ( jesus and saint peter ) the 17th-century critic giovanni bellori , in his survey entitled idea , praised carracci as the paragon of italian painters , who had fostered a '' renaissance '' of the great tradition of raphael and michelangelo . on the other hand , while admitting caravaggio 's talents as a painter , bellori deplored his over-naturalistic style , if not his turbulent morals and persona . he thus viewed the caravaggisti styles with the same gloomy dismay . painters were urged to depict the platonic ideal of beauty , not roman street-walkers . yet carracci and caravaggio patrons and pupils did not all fall into irreconcilable camps . contemporary patrons , such as marquess vincenzo giustiniani , found both applied showed excellence in maniera and modeling . wittkover , p . 57 . by the 21st century , observers had warmed to the rebel myth of caravaggio , and often ignored the profound influence on art that carracci had . caravaggio almost never worked in fresco , regarded as the test of a great painter 's mettle . on the other hand , carracci 's best works are in fresco . thus the somber canvases of caravaggio , with benighted backgrounds , are suited to the contemplative altars , and not to well-lit walls or ceilings such as this one in the farnese . wittkower was surprised that a farnese cardinal surrounded himself with frescoes of libidinous themes , indicative of a '' considerable relaxation of counter-reformatory morality '' . this thematic choice suggests carracci may have been more rebellious relative to the often-solemn religious passion of caravaggio 's canvases . wittkower states carracci 's '' frescoes convey the impression of a tremendous joie de vivre , a new blossoming of vitality and of an energy long repressed '' . in the 21st century , most connoisseurs making the pilgrimage to the cerasi chapel in santa maria del popolo would ignore carracci 's assumption of the virgin altarpiece ( 1600–1601 ) and focus on the flanking caravaggio works . it is instructive to compare carracci 's assumption see the more adept altarpiece at the prado ( paintings by annibale carracci . web gallery of art , retrieved may 28 , 2011 ) with caravaggio 's death of the virgin . among early contemporaries , carracci was an innovator . he re-enlivened michelangelo 's visual fresco vocabulary , and posited a muscular and vivaciously brilliant pictorial landscape , which had been becoming progressively crippled into a mannerism tangle . while michelangelo could bend and contort the body into all the possible perspectives , carracci in the farnese frescoes had shown how it could dance . the '' ceiling '' -frontiers , the wide expanses of walls to be frescoed would , for the next decades , be thronged by the monumental brilliance of the carracci followers , and not caravaggio 's followers . in the century following his death , to a lesser extent than bernini and cortona , carracci and baroque art in general came under criticism from neoclassic critics such as winckelmann and even later from the prudish john ruskin , as well as admirers of caravaggio . carracci in part was spared opprobrium because he was seen as an emulator of the highly admired raphael , and in the farnese frescoes , attentive to the proper themes such as those of antique mythology . landscapes , genre art and drawings . on july 8 , 1595 , annibale completed the painting of saint roch giving alms , now in dresden gemäldegalerie . other significant late works painted by carracci in rome include domine , quo vadis ? ( c . 1602 ) , which reveals a striking economy in figure composition and a force and precision of gesture that influenced on poussin and through him , the language of gesture in painting . carracci was remarkably eclectic in thematic , painting landscapes , genre scenes , and portraits , including a series of autoportraits across the ages . he was one of the first italian painters to paint a canvas wherein landscape took priority over figures , such as his masterful the flight into egypt ; this is a genre in which he was followed by domenichino ( his favorite pupil ) and claude lorrain . carracci 's art also had a less formal side that comes out in his caricatures ( he is generally credited with inventing the form ) and in his early genre paintings , which are remarkable for their lively observation and free handling see the butcher 's shop and his painting of the beaneater . he is described by biographers as inattentive to dress , obsessed with work : his self-portraits ( such as that in parma ) vary in his depiction . see mostra . under a melancholic humor . it is not clear how much work annibale completed after finishing the major gallery in the palazzo farnese . in 1606 , annibale signs a madonna of the bowl . however , in a letter from april 1606 , cardinal odoardo farnese bemoans that a '' heavy melancholic humor '' prevented annibale from painting for him . throughout 1607 , annibale is unable to complete a commission for the duke of modena of a nativity . there is a note from 1608 , where in annibale stipulates to a pupil that he will spend at least two hours a day in his studio . there is little documentation from the man or time to explain why his brush was stilled . speculation abounds . in 1609 , annibale died and was buried , according to his wish , near raphael in the pantheon of rome . it is a measure of his achievement that artists as diverse as bernini , poussin , and rubens praised his work . many of his assistants or pupils in projects at the palazzo farnese and herrera chapel would become among the pre-eminent artists of the next decades , including domenichino , francesco albani , giovanni lanfranco , domenico viola , guido reni , sisto badalocchio , and others . chronology of works . paintings . butcher 's shop ( 1580s ) —oil on canvas , 185 × 266 & nbsp ;
