'' snader hired dozens of pop-music acts and vaudeville performers , many of whom had already appeared in soundies , to star in his new films . snader telescriptions are often confused with soundies because of their similarity in length and personnel . scott macgillivray and ted okuda , the soundies book : a revised and expanded guide , iuniverse , 2007 ; . telescriptions became a haven for bandleaders and singers of the 1940s , including charlie barnet , bob wills , tony pastor , gloria jean , carolina cotton , allan jones , and andy russell . snader telescriptions were widely syndicated and hundreds of film prints survive . in 1958 , the original soundies '' jukebox '' concept was revived by the french company cameca as scopitone . similar to soundies , scopitones are short musical films designed to be played on a specially designed coin-operated jukebox , but with new technical improvements : color and high-fidelity sound . scopitones were printed on color 16mm film with magnetic sound instead of soundies ' optical sound . by the mid-1960s , scopitone jukeboxes had spread across england and the united states . many well-known american and french popular music acts of the 1960s made scopitone films such as the exciters , brigitte bardot , debbie reynolds , vic damone , dalida , herb alpert & the tijuana brass , procol harum , neil sedaka , serge gainsbourg , johnny hallyday , sylvie vartan , brook benton , ray anthony , gale garnett , sacha distel , buddy greco , tommy james & the shondells , della reese , bobby rydell , petula clark , bobby vee , lou christie , the shadows , jody miller , kay starr , dionne warwick , jane morgan , nancy sinatra , fran√ßoise hardy , and julie london . the scopitone was popular until the end of the decade . documentaries . three documentaries have been produced about soundies . don mcglynn produced and edited '' the soundies '' in 1986 , hosted by cab calloway ; the film was broadcast nationally on pbs . dewey russell compiled an hourlong , direct-to-video history , '' soundies : music video from the '40s '' in 1987 , narrated by michael sollazzo . chris lamson produced '' soundies : a musical history , '' hosted by michael feinstein , in 2007 for pbs . further reading . scott macgillivray and ted okuda , the soundies book : a revised and expanded guide , iuniverse , 2007 ; . billboard magazine . references . external links .
