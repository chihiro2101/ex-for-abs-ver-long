D. Napier & Son

history . early years and precision engineering . david napier , second son of the blacksmith to the duke of argyll , was born in 1785 . while cousins became shipbuilders , he took engineering training in scotland before coming to london . there in 1808 he founded the firm that was to become d . napier & son in lloyds court , st giles , london . wilson & reader ( 1958 ) . he designed a steam-powered printing press , some of which went to hansard ( the printer and publisher of proceedings of the houses of parliament ) , as well as newspapers . the company moved to lambeth , south london in 1830 . between 1840 and 1860 , napier was prosperous , with a well-outfitted factory and between 200 and 300 workers . napier made a wide variety of products , including a centrifuge for sugar manufacturing , lathes and drills , ammunition-making equipment for the royal arsenal , woolwich , and railway cranes . hull ( 1974 ) , p . & nbsp ; 1438 david 's younger son james murdoch , born 1823 , joined the firm in 1837 and became a partner in 1847 , resulting in a change in the private company 's name to d . napier & son . james succeeded his father as head of the firm in 1867 , and after his father 's death in 1873 , specialized in crafted precision machinery for making coins , printing stamps and banknotes . james proved an excellent engineer , but a poor businessman , considering salesmanship undignified . his company 's fortunes went so bad that there were as few as seven employees in 1895 , and james attempted to sell the business , but failed . hull ( 1974 ) , p . & nbsp ; 1484 . montague napier and high-performance vehicles . james ' son montague , born 1870 , inherited the business in 1895 , along with his father 's engineering talents . montague was a hobby bicycle racing , and at the bath road club , he met '' ebullient australian '' s . f . edge ( then a manager at dunlop rubber and colleague of h . j . lawson in london , and amateur racer of motorcycles . ) edge persuaded napier to improve his panhard '' old number 8 '' ( which had won the 1896 paris–marseille–paris ) , converting from a tiller to a steering wheel and improving the oiling . dissatisfied , napier offered to fit an engine of his own design , an 8 hp vertical twin , with sparkplug , superior to the panhard 's hot tube type . hull ( 1974 ) , p . & nbsp ; 1485 edge was sufficiently impressed to encourage napier to make his own car and collaborated with harvey du cros , his former boss at dunlop , to form the motor power company , based in london , which agreed to buy napier 's entire output . the first of an initial order of six , three each two-cylinder 8 & nbsp ; hp and four-cylinder 16 & nbsp ; hp , all with aluminum bodies by arthur mulliner of northampton and chain drive , was delivered 31 march 1900 ; edge paid £400 and sold at £500 . in 1903 the manufacturing business moved from lambeth to larger premises in acton and in 1906 it became a limited liability company , d . napier & son limited , although it remained in effect a private company for the next few years . outside the racing program , napier also gained fame in 1904 by being the first car to cross the canadian rockies : mr and mrs charles glidden , sponsors of the glidden tours , covered from boston to vancouver . clymer , floyd . treasury of early american automobiles , 1877–1925 ( new york : bonanza books , 1950 ) , p . 30 . . racing . recognizing the value of publicity gained from racing , which no other british marque did , wise ( 1974 ) p . 589 . in spring , edge entered an 8 & nbsp ; hp ( 6 & nbsp ; kw ) napier in the thousand miles ( 1,600 & nbsp ; km ) trial of the automobile club on behalf of mary eliza kennard ; driven by edge , with kennard along , on a circuit from newbury to edinburgh and back , it won its class , being one of only thirty-five finishers ( of sixty-four starters wise ( 1974 ) ) and one of just twelve to average the requisite 12 & nbsp ; mph ( 19 & nbsp ; km/h ) in england and 10 & nbsp ; mph ( 16 & nbsp ; km/h ) in scotland . wise ( 1974 ) p . 1486 . by june 1900 , eight '' 16 hp '' s had been ordered , and edge entered one in the 837 & nbsp ; mi ( 1,350 & nbsp ; km ) paris-toulouse-paris race , with charles rolls ( co-founder of rolls-royce ) as riding mechanic . the 301.6 cu in ( 4.94 l ) ( 101.6×152.4 & nbsp ; mm , 4x6 in ) sidevalve suffered problems with its ignition coils and cooling system , and failed to finish . wise ( 1974 ) for 1901 , montague designed a car sure not to lack speed , having a 16.3-litre ( 995.5 cu in ) ( 165.1×190.5 & nbsp ; mm , 6.5×7.5 in ) sidevalve four capable of at 800 rpm , on a wheelbase of 115 & nbsp ; inches ( 2.921 & nbsp ; m ) wise ( 1974 ) with four-speed gearbox and chain drive . called the '' 50 hp '' , only two or three were completed , including one for rolls . edge entered one in the 1901 gordon bennett cup , only able to test it en route ( it was completed 25 may , only four days before the event ) , montague serving as his riding mechanic ; it overpowered its dunlops , and fitting new ( french ) tires led to disqualification , since they were not of the same nation of origin . wise ( 1974 ) pp . 1486–7 . in the concurrent paris-bordeaux rally , it retired with clutch trouble . hull ( 1974 ) , p . 1487 . for the 1902 gordon bennett , three entrants ( the charron-girardot-voigt , a mors and a panhard ) contested for france , with edge in a napier and two wolseleys . the napier was a three-speed , shaft-drive 6.44-litre ( 392.7 cu in ) four ( 127×127 & nbsp ; mm , 5x5 in ) of 44.5 & nbsp ; hp ( 33 & nbsp ; kw ) ( though described as a 30 & nbsp ; hp ) . piloted by edge and his cousin , cecil , it wore what would become known as british racing green , and won at an average 31.8 & nbsp ; mph ( 51.2 & nbsp ; km/h ) ; although by default , since all other entrants retired during the race . it was the first british victory in international motorsport , and would not be repeated until henry segrave took the french grand prix in 1923 . napiers also inspired charles j . glidden to create the glidden tours in upstate new york , which in turn persuaded napier to build a factory in boston . it , along with the genoa factory ( managed by arthur mcdonald ) , which built napiers under license as san giorgios from 1906–9 , was not a success . wise ( 1974 ) , p.1488 . annual production reached 250 cars in 1903 , overwhelming the lambeth factory , so a move was made to a new plant at acton , in west london . on 16 october of that year , napier announced a six-cylinder car for 1904 and became the first manufacturer to make a commercially successful six , a '' remarkably smooth and flexible '' vehicle 18 & nbsp ; hp 301 cu in ( 4.9-litre ) ( 101.6×101.6 & nbsp ; mm , 4×4 in ) with a three-speed gearbox and chain drive . within five years , there were 62 makers of six-cylinder cars in britain alone , including the ford motor company 's 1906 model k . g . n . georgano cars : early and vintage , 1886–1930 . ( london : grange-universal , 1985 ) napier 's 1902 win brought the gordon bennett hosting duties to the united kingdom , and the 1903 event was held south of dublin , with three shaft-driven napiers defending the british and irish honor , all in the ( later famous ) racing green : two 470 cubic inch ( 7708 & nbsp ; cc ) 45 & nbsp ; horsepower ( 33.5 & nbsp ; kw ) fours for charles jarrott and j . w . stocks , with mcdonald , the genoa plant manager , his riding mechanic , and an 80-horsepower ( 838 cubic inch , 13,726 & nbsp ; cc ) , the type k5 , for edge . jarrott and stocks crashed , and edge was disqualified . hull ( 1974 ) it was a bad year for napier 's racing program ; a 35 & nbsp ; hp in the hands of colonel mark mayhew in the paris-madrid rally lost its steering and hit a tree . edge , again with mcdonald , fared no better with the k5 in the 1904 gordon bennett in germany , but a new 920 cubic inch ( 15-litre ; 158.7×127 & nbsp ; mm , 6.25×5-inch ) six , the l48 , with an external radiator reminiscent of the cord 810 , set the fastest time at the velvet strand speed trials at portmarnock , ireland , in september , piloted by mcdonald . wise ( 1974 ) p . 1,489 in january 1905 , the l48 , again with mcdonald in the seat , took the mile ( 1.6 & nbsp ; km ) record at daytona beach at 104.65 & nbsp ; mph ( 168.41 & nbsp ; km/h ) ; although this was shortly broken by bowden 's mercedes , the run was disallowed . the versatile mcdonald ran the l48 in the 1905 gordon bennett qualifying event at the isle of man , taken over for the race by works driver clifford earp , who placed ninth . edge 's secretary , dorothy levitt , drove a 100 & nbsp ; hp ( 74.6 & nbsp ; kw ) development of the k5 at the blackpool and brighton speed trials in 1905 , and the next year ran the l48 at the blackpool speed trials , showing talent by equalling edge 's speed and setting a women 's record in the flying kilometre of 90.88 & nbsp ; mph ( 146.25 & nbsp ; km/h ) . by 1907 , 1200 & nbsp ; people were employed by napier and were making about a hundred cars a year , aided by continuing racing success . brooklands opened that year , where napier engineer h . c . tryon won the first ever event in a , and edge made a famous 24-hour run in june , covering 1,581 & nbsp ; miles ( 2,544 & nbsp ; km ) at an average 65.905 & nbsp ; mph ( 106.06 & nbsp ; km/h ) in a 60-horsepower 589 cubic inch ( 9,652 & nbsp ; cc ) ( 127×127 & nbsp ; mm , 5×5-inch ) six , a record which stood for 18 & nbsp ; years . hull ( 1974 ) , p . 1,489 . the l48 , nicknamed samson , became famous there in the venue 's first two years ; in 1908 , napier 's frank newton covered half a mile ( 800 & nbsp ; m ) at 119.34 & nbsp ; mph ( 190.05 & nbsp ; km/h ) in a stroked ( 178 & nbsp ; mm , 7-inch ) l48 . the company 's last race win was with a four-cylinder at the 1908 tourist trophy , using an alias , hutton , to preserve the reputation of the sixes , in the hands of willy watson . hull ( 1974 ) , p . 1490 . at the french grand prix , officials showed the perverse reasoning for which they later became notorious by claiming that removable wire wheels were an unfair advantage . when napier was no longer in racing , its lion aero engine was used by several land speed record contestants : malcolm campbell 's napier-campbell blue bird of 1927 and campbell-napier-railton blue bird of 1931 , segrave 's golden arrow of 1929 , and john cobb 's napier-railton and railton special , which held the record from 1939–64 . motor yachting . napier expanded into marine engines and launches . in 1903 a s . f . edge 's napier launch won the inaugural british international harmsworth trophy for speedboats at cork harbour in ireland , driven by dorothy levitt . she achieved in a steel-hulled , speedboat fitted with a 3-blade propeller . as both the owner and entrant of the boat , '' s . f . edge '' is engraved on the trophy as the winner . the third crew member , campbell muir , may also have taken the controls . on 8 august 1903 levitt drove the napier at cowes and won the race . she was then commanded to the royal yacht by king edward vii where he congratulated her on her pluck and skill , and they discussed the performance of the boat and its potential for british government despatch work .

'' the lion came into service shortly before the end of the war . during the first world war the company was also contracted to build 600 aircraft at the acton factory ( 50 royal aircraft factory r.e.7 , 400 royal aircraft factory r.e.8 and 150 sopwith snipes ) . together with the engine work , this required enormous expansion of the company . interwar period . by the end of the war , military production had tailed off and the lion was still barely in use . in 1919 civilian car production was recommenced . the t75 motor car would be napier 's last . designed by a . j . rowledge ( who left for rolls-royce in 1921 ) , its engine was a 40–50 & nbsp ; hp alloy six with detachable cylinder head , single overhead camshaft , seven-bearing crankshaft , dual magneto and coil ignition , dual plugs , and napier-su carburettor . coachwork was by cunard , by then a subsidiary . 187 were built in all by 1924 , and napier quit car production with a total of 4,258 built . the car was very expensive , costing about the same as a rolls-royce silver ghost and in the early 1920s sales were slow . the last car was sold in 1924 . the lion was by now becoming a best-seller for the company , which eventually dropped all the other aero-engines . the lion went on to be adapted for land and water , to set the land speed record in malcolm campbell 's napier-campbell blue bird of 1927 and campbell-napier-railton blue bird 0f 1931 and henry segrave 's golden arrow of 1931 and later in john cobb 's napier-railton and railton mobil special , which held the record from 1939–64 . in the 1930s the introduction of much larger and more powerful aero-engines from other companies ended sales of the lion . napier quickly started work on newer designs , building on experience gained on the x style 16-cylinder , 1,000 & nbsp ; hp ( 746 & nbsp ; kw ) cub , used in the blackburn cubaroo single-engined bomber of the 1920s , and the resulting later 16-cylinder rapier and 24-cylinder dagger were both air-cooled h-block designs . neither the rapier nor the dagger proved very reliable , due to poor cooling of the rearmost cylinders , and even the dagger 's was less than its competitors ' offerings when shipped . as lion sales faded , an attempt was also made to buy the bankrupt bentley company in 1931 but napier was outbid at the last minute by rolls-royce . the last vehicle project was a three-wheeled tractor-trailer goods vehicle , but rather than produce this itself , the design was sold to scammell , which made several thousand . second world war . starting from scratch , napier decided to use the new sleeve valve design in a much larger h-block 24-cylinder engine , soon to be known as the sabre . designed under frank halford , the engine was very advanced and proved to be difficult to adapt to assembly line production . therefore , although the engine was ready by 1940 , it was not until 1944 that production versions were considered reliable . at that point efforts were made to improve it , leading eventually to the sabre vii delivering 3,500 & nbsp ; hp ( 2,600 & nbsp ; kw ) , making it the most powerful engine in the world , from an engine much smaller than its competition . napier also worked on aircraft diesel engine . in the 1930s it licensed the junkers jumo 204 for production in england , which it called the culverin . it also planned to produce a smaller version of the same basic design as the cutlass , but work on both was cancelled at the outbreak of war in 1939 . napier developed a marine engine from the lion aero engine , the petrol-driven sea lion , which could deliver and was used in the raf rescue launch launches . during the war ( 1944 ) napier was asked by the royal navy to supply a diesel engine for use in its patrol boats , but the culverin 's 720 & nbsp ; hp ( 537 & nbsp ; kw ) was not nearly enough for its needs . napier then designed under the leadership of ernest edward chatterton , chief engineer , the deltic , essentially three culverins arranged in a large triangle . considered one of the most complex engine designs of its day , the deltic was nevertheless very reliable , and was taken into service after the war as a locomotive powerplant ( in british rail 's class 55 ) in addition to the torpedo boats , minesweepers and other small naval vessels for which it was designed . also during the second world war a six-cylinder 300 cubic inch road-vehicle engine was commissioned by the government , but this design was sold to leyland motors by 1945 . post-war . . english electric . napier had been taken over by english electric on 23 november 1942 . sharp , dan : british secret projects 5 : britain 's space shuttle , crécy , 2016 , p.11 . last of the great napier internal combustion engines was the nomad , a complicated '' turbo-compound '' design that combined a diesel engine with a turbine to recover energy otherwise lost in the exhaust . the advantage of this complex design was fuel economy : it had the best specific fuel consumption of any aircraft engine , even to this day . however , even better fuel economy could be had by flying a normal jet engine at much higher altitudes , while existing designs filled the '' low end '' of the market fairly well . first run in 1949 , the nomad i underwent radical redesign for the nomad ii but was largely ignored by the market and was cancelled in 1955 . along with every major aero engine company in the post-war era , napier turned to the jet turbine . seeing a niche not yet adopted up by the larger vendors , napier developed a number of turboshaft designs which saw some use , notably in helicopters . its first design , the naiad and double naiad was developed for various royal navy fleet air arm projects , but did not enter production . the smaller models developed later , the 3,000-hp-class eland and 1,500-hp-class gazelle did somewhat better , notably the gazelle which powered several models of the popular westland wessex helicopter . production ceased when a deal was struck with rolls-royce in 1961 . at the same time , the ramjet was showing promise for high-speed supersonic flight . from 1951 napier developed a successful large-diameter experimental engine , the napier ram jet ( nrj ) . napier continued in ramjet development for several years , typically working alongside the english electric aircraft design team . sharp , dan ; british secret projects 5 : britain 's space shuttle , crécy , 2016 , pp . 18–19 . . napier aero engines limited . in 1961 a new company napier aero engines limited was formed by d . napier & son and rolls-royce , to take over the napier aero-engine business and the acton engine factory . it was to continue to market the gazelle , while the completion of existing gazelle contracts and the eland remained the financial responsibility of the old company . but it closed only two years later , in 1963 . following the move of the aero engine business , d . napier & son continued as a subsidiary of english electric . with the ending of deltic sales in the 1960s it had no new modern engine designs to offer . today napier is no longer in the engine business . napier turbochargers . gec bought english electric in the late 1960s . the gec operation , now part of ruston gas turbines , later moved to gec-alsthom and then alstom , before being sold to siemens in march 2003 . napier turbochargers was bought from siemens in june 2008 in a management buyout . the buyout was funded by the private equity company primary capital for around £100 & nbsp ; million . early in 2013 napier turbochargers became part of wabtec . napier turbochargers currently produces turbochargers for the marine , power and rail industries , employing around 150 people . list of napier aero engines . these engines were all built , some in several variants .
