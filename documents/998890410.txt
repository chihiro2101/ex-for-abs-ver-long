Johann Gerhard

biography . he was born in the german city of quedlinburg . during a dangerous illness , at the age of fourteen he came under the personal influence of johann arndt , author of das wahre christenthum , and resolved to study for the church . he entered the university of wittenberg in 1599 , and studied philosophy and theology . a relative then persuaded him to change his subject , and he studied medicine for two years . in 1603 , he resumed his theological reading at jena , and in the following year received a new impulse from j.w . winckelmann and balthasar mentzer at marburg . he graduated in 1605 and began to give lectures at jena , then in 1606 he accepted the invitation of john casimir , duke of coburg , to the superintendency of heldburg , today bad colberg-heldburg , and mastership of the gymnasium casimirianum coburg ; soon afterwards he became general superintendent of the duchy , in which capacity he was engaged in the practical work of ecclesiastical organization until 1616 , when he became the senior theological professor at jena , where the remainder of his life was spent . here , with johann major and johann himmel , he formed the '' trias johannea . '' though still comparatively young , gerhard was already regarded as the greatest living theology of protestant germany ; in the '' disputations '' of the period he was always protagonist , and his advice was sought on all public and domestic questions touching on religion or morals . during his lifetime he received repeated calls to almost every university in germany ( e.g . giessen , altdorf , helmstedt , jena , wittenberg ) , as well as to uppsala in sweden . he died in jena . writings . his writings are numerous , alike in exegetical , polemical , dogmatic and practical theology . to the first category belong the ( 1617 ) , the comment , super priorem d . petri epistolam ( 1641 ) , and also his commentaries on genesis ( 1637 ) and on deuteronomy ( 1658 ) . of a controversial character are the confessio catholica ( 1633–1637 ) , an extensive work which seeks to prove the evangelical catholic character of the doctrine of the augsburg confession from the writings of approved roman catholic authors ; and the loci communes theologici ( 1610–1622 ) , his principal contribution , in which lutheranism is expounded '' nervose , solide et copiose , '' in fact with a fulness of learning , a force of logic and a minuteness of detail that had never before been approached . the meditationes sacrae ( 1606 ) , a work expressly devoted to the uses of christian edification , has been frequently reprinted in latin and has been translated into most of the european languages , including greek . works . a full listing of printings of gerhard 's works from 1601–2002 is in johann anselm steiger , ed . , bibliographia gerhardina 1601–2002 : verzeichnis der druckschriften johann gerhards ( 1582–1637 ) sowie ihrer neuausgaben , übersetzungen und bearbeitungen ( stuttgart-bad cannstatt : frommann-holzboog , 2003 ) . loci theologici ( 1610–1625 ;
