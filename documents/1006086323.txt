Mathematical physics

scope . there are several distinct branches of mathematical physics , and these roughly correspond to particular historical periods . classical mechanics . the rigorous , abstract and advanced reformulation of newtonian mechanics adopting the lagrangian mechanics and the hamiltonian mechanics even in the presence of constraints . both formulations are embodied in analytical mechanics and lead to understanding the deep interplay of the notions of symmetry and conserved quantities during the dynamical evolution , as embodied within the most elementary formulation of noether theorem . these approaches and ideas have been extended to other areas of physics as statistical mechanics , continuum mechanics , classical field theory and quantum field theory . moreover , they have provided several examples and ideas in differential geometry ( e.g . several notions in symplectic geometry and vector bundle ) . partial differential equations . following mathematics : the theory of partial differential equation , variational calculus , fourier analysis , potential theory , and vector analysis are perhaps most closely associated with mathematical physics . these were developed intensively from the second half of the 18th century ( by , for example , d'alembert , euler , and lagrange ) until the 1930s . physical applications of these developments include hydrodynamics , celestial mechanics , continuum mechanics , elasticity theory , acoustics , thermodynamics , electricity , magnetism , and aerodynamics . quantum theory . the theory of atomic spectra ( and , later , quantum mechanics ) developed almost concurrently with some parts of the mathematical fields of linear algebra , the spectral theory of operators , operator algebras and more broadly , functional analysis . nonrelativistic quantum mechanics includes schrödinger operators , and it has connections to atomic and molecular physics . quantum information theory is another subspecialty . relativity and quantum relativistic theories . the special and general theories of relativity require a rather different type of mathematics . this was group theory , which played an important role in both quantum field theory and differential geometry . this was , however , gradually supplemented by topology and functional analysis in the mathematical description of cosmological as well as quantum field theory phenomena . in the mathematical description of this physical areas , some concepts in homological algebra and category theory are also important nowadays . statistical mechanics . statistical mechanics forms a separate field , which includes the theory of phase transitions . it relies upon the hamiltonian mechanics ( or its quantum version ) and it is closely related with the more mathematical ergodic theory and some parts of probability theory . there are increasing interactions between combinatorics and physics , in particular statistical physics . usage . the usage of the term '' mathematical physics '' is sometimes idiosyncratic . certain parts of mathematics that initially arose from the development of physics are not , in fact , considered parts of mathematical physics , while other closely related fields are . for example , ordinary differential equations and symplectic geometry are generally viewed as purely mathematical disciplines , whereas dynamical systems and hamiltonian mechanics belong to mathematical physics . john herapath used the term for the title of his 1847 text on '' mathematical principles of natural philosophy '' ; the scope at that time being '' the causes of heat , gaseous elasticity , gravitation , and other great phenomena of nature '' . john herapath ( 1847 ) mathematical physics ; or , the mathematical principles of natural philosophy , the causes of heat , gaseous elasticity , gravitation , and other great phenomena of nature , whittaker and company via hathitrust . mathematical vs . theoretical physics . the term '' mathematical physics '' is sometimes used to denote research aimed at studying and solving problems in physics or thought experiments within a mathematically rigorous framework . in this sense , mathematical physics covers a very broad academic realm distinguished only by the blending of some mathematical aspect and physics theoretical aspect . although related to theoretical physics , quote : '' . a negative definition of the theorist refers to his inability to make physical experiments , while a positive one . implies his encyclopaedic knowledge of physics combined with possessing enough mathematical armament . depending on the ratio of these two components , the theorist may be nearer either to the experimentalist or to the mathematician . in the latter case , he is usually considered as a specialist in mathematical physics . '' , ya . frenkel , as related in a.t . filippov , the versatile soliton , pg 131 . birkhauser , 2000 . mathematical physics in this sense emphasizes the mathematical rigour of the similar type as found in mathematics . on the other hand , theoretical physics emphasizes the links to observations and experimental physics , which often requires theoretical physicists ( and mathematical physicists in the more general sense ) to use heuristic , intuitive , and approximate arguments . quote : '' physical theory is something like a suit sewed for nature . good theory is like a good suit . thus the theorist is like a tailor . '' ya . frenkel , as related in filippov ( 2000 ) , pg 131 . such arguments are not considered rigorous by mathematicians , but that is changing over time . such mathematical physicists primarily expand and elucidate physical theories . because of the required level of mathematical rigour , these researchers often deal with questions that theoretical physicists have considered to be already solved . however , they can sometimes show that the previous solution was incomplete , incorrect , or simply too naïve . issues about attempts to infer the second law of thermodynamics from statistical mechanics are examples . other examples concern the subtleties involved with synchronisation procedures in special and general relativity ( sagnac effect and einstein synchronisation ) . the effort to put physical theories on a mathematically rigorous footing not only developed physics but also has influenced developments of some mathematical areas . for example , the development of quantum mechanics and some aspects of functional analysis parallel each other in many ways . the mathematical study of quantum mechanics , quantum field theory , and quantum statistical mechanics has motivated results in operator algebras . the attempt to construct a rigorous mathematical formulation of quantum field theory has also brought about some progress in fields such as representation theory . prominent mathematical physicists . before newton . in the first decade of the 16th century , amateur astronomer nicolaus copernicus proposed heliocentrism , and published a treatise on it in 1543 . he retained the ptolemy idea of epicycles , and merely sought to simplify astronomy by constructing simpler sets of epicyclic orbits . epicycles consist of circles upon circles . according to aristotelian physics , the circle was the perfect form of motion , and was the intrinsic motion of aristotle 's fifth element—the quintessence or universal essence known in greek as aether for the english pure air—that was the pure substance beyond the sublunary sphere , and thus was celestial entities ' pure composition . the german johannes kepler 1571–1630 , tycho brahe 's assistant , modified copernican orbits to ellipses , formalized in the equations of kepler 's laws of planetary motion . an enthusiastic atomist , galileo galilei in his 1623 book the assayer asserted that the '' book of nature is written in mathematics '' . peter machamer '' galileo galilei '' —sec 1 '' brief biography '' , in zalta en , ed , the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy , spring 2010 edn his 1632 book , about his telescopic observations , supported heliocentrism . antony g flew , dictionary of philosophy , rev 2nd edn ( new york : st martin 's press , 1984 ) , p 129 having introduced experimentation , galileo then refuted geocentric cosmology by refuting aristotelian physics itself . galilei 's 1638 book discourse on two new sciences established the law of equal free fall as well as the principles of inertial motion , founding the central concepts of what would become today 's classical mechanics . by the galilean law of inertia as well as the principle of galilean invariance , also called galilean relativity , for any object experiencing inertia , there is empirical justification for knowing only that it is at relative rest or relative motion—rest or motion with respect to another object . rené descartes adopted galilean principles and developed a complete system of heliocentric cosmology , anchored on the principle of vortex motion , cartesian physics , whose widespread acceptance brought the demise of aristotelian physics . descartes sought to formalize mathematical reasoning in science , and developed cartesian coordinates for geometrically plotting locations in 3d space and marking their progressions along the flow of time . antony g flew , dictionary of philosophy , rev 2nd edn ( new york : st martin 's press , 1984 ) , p 89 christiaan huygens was the first to transfer mathematical inquiry to describe unobservable physical phenomena , and for that reason huygens is regarded as the first theoretical physics and the founder of mathematical physics . dijksterhuis , f . j .

kelvin made substantial discoveries in thermodynamics ; hamilton did notable work on analytical mechanics , discovering a new and powerful approach nowadays known as hamiltonian mechanics . very relevant contributions to this approach are due to his german colleague mathematician carl gustav jacobi ( 1804–1851 ) in particular referring to canonical transformations . the german hermann von helmholtz ( 1821–1894 ) made substantial contributions in the fields of electromagnetism , waves , fluids , and sound . in the united states , the pioneering work of josiah willard gibbs ( 1839–1903 ) became the basis for statistical mechanics . fundamental theoretical results in this area were achieved by the german ludwig boltzmann ( 1844-1906 ) . together , these individuals laid the foundations of electromagnetic theory , fluid dynamics , and statistical mechanics . relativistic . by the 1880s , there was a prominent paradox that an observer within maxwell 's electromagnetic field measured it at approximately constant speed , regardless of the observer 's speed relative to other objects within the electromagnetic field . thus , although the observer 's speed was continually lost relative to the electromagnetic field , it was preserved relative to other objects in the electromagnetic field . and yet no violation of galilean invariance within physical interactions among objects was detected . as maxwell 's electromagnetic field was modeled as oscillations of the aether , physicists inferred that motion within the aether resulted in aether drift , shifting the electromagnetic field , explaining the observer 's missing speed relative to it . the galilean transformation had been the mathematical process used to translate the positions in one reference frame to predictions of positions in another reference frame , all plotted on cartesian coordinates , but this process was replaced by lorentz transformation , modeled by the dutch hendrik lorentz 1853–1928 . in 1887 , experimentalists michelson and morley failed to detect aether drift , however . it was hypothesized that motion into the aether prompted aether 's shortening , too , as modeled in the lorentz contraction . it was hypothesized that the aether thus kept maxwell 's electromagnetic field aligned with the principle of galilean invariance across all inertial frames of reference , while newton 's theory of motion was spared . austrian theoretical physicist and philosopher ernst mach criticized newton 's postulated absolute space . mathematician henri poincaré ( 1854–1912 ) questioned even absolute time . in 1905 , pierre duhem published a devastating criticism of the foundation of newton 's theory of motion . also in 1905 , albert einstein ( 1879–1955 ) published his special theory of relativity , newly explaining both the electromagnetic field 's invariance and galilean invariance by discarding all hypotheses concerning aether , including the existence of aether itself . refuting the framework of newton 's theory—absolute space and time—special relativity refers to relative space and relative time , whereby length contracts and time dilates along the travel pathway of an object . in 1908 , einstein 's former mathematics professor hermann minkowski modeled 3d space together with the 1d axis of time by treating the temporal axis like a fourth spatial dimension—altogether 4d spacetime—and declared the imminent demise of the separation of space and time . minkowski , hermann ( 1908–1909 ) , '' raum und zeit '' space and time , physikalische zeitschrift , 10 : 75–88 einstein initially called this '' superfluous learnedness '' , but later used minkowski spacetime with great elegance in his general theory of relativity , salmon wc & wolters g , eds , logic , language , and the structure of scientific theories ( pittsburgh : university of pittsburgh press , 1994 ) , p 125 extending invariance to all reference frames—whether perceived as inertial or as accelerated—and credited this to minkowski , by then deceased . general relativity replaces cartesian coordinates with gaussian coordinates , and replaces newton 's claimed empty yet euclidean space traversed instantly by newton 's vector of hypothetical gravitational force—an instant action at a distance—with a gravitational field . the gravitational field is minkowski spacetime itself , the 4d topology of einstein aether modeled on a lorentzian manifold that '' curves '' geometrically , according to the riemann curvature tensor . the concept of newton 's gravity : '' two masses attract each other '' replaced by the geometrical arugument : '' mass transform curvatures of spacetime and free falling particles with mass move along a geodesic curve in the spacetime '' ( riemannian geometry already existed before 1850s , by mathematicians carl friedrich gauss and bernhard riemann in search for intrinsic geometry and non-euclidean geometry . ) , in the vicinity of either mass or energy . ( under special relativity—a special case of general relativity—even massless energy exerts gravitational effect by its mass equivalence locally '' curving '' the geometry of the four , unified dimensions of space and time . ) . quantum . another revolutionary development of the 20th century was quantum theory , which emerged from the seminal contributions of max planck ( 1856–1947 ) ( on planck 's law ) and einstein 's work on the photoelectric effect . in 1912 , a mathematician henri poincare published sur la théorie des quanta . he introduced the first non-naïve definition of quantization in this paper . the development of early quantum physics followed by a heuristic framework devised by arnold sommerfeld ( 1868–1951 ) and niels bohr ( 1885–1962 ) , but this was soon replaced by the quantum mechanics developed by max born ( 1882–1970 ) , werner heisenberg ( 1901–1976 ) , paul dirac ( 1902–1984 ) , erwin schrödinger ( 1887–1961 ) , satyendra nath bose ( 1894–1974 ) , and wolfgang pauli ( 1900–1958 ) . this revolutionary theoretical framework is based on a probabilistic interpretation of states , and evolution and measurements in terms of self-adjoint operators on an infinite-dimensional vector space . that is called hilbert space ( introduced by mathematicians david hilbert ( 1862–1943 ) , erhard schmidt ( 1876-1959 ) and frigyes riesz ( 1880-1956 ) in search of generalization of euclidean space and study of integral equations ) , and rigorously defined within the axiomatic modern version by john von neumann in his celebrated book mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics , where he built up a relevant part of modern functional analysis on hilbert spaces , the spectral theory ( introduced by david hilbert who investigated quadratic forms with infinitely many variables . many years later , it had been revealed that his spectral theory is associated with the spectrum of the hydrogen atom . he was surprised by this application . ) in particular . paul dirac used algebraic constructions to produce a relativistic model for the electron , predicting its magnetic moment and the existence of its antiparticle , the positron . list of prominent contributors to mathematical physics in the 20th century . prominent contributors to the 20th century 's mathematical physics include , ( ordered by birth date ) william thomson ( lord kelvin ) 1824–1907 , oliver heaviside 1850–1925 , henri poincaré 1854–1912 , david hilbert 1862–1943 , arnold sommerfeld 1868–1951 , constantin carathéodory 1873–1950 , albert einstein 1879–1955 , max born 1882–1970 , george david birkhoff 1884-1944 , hermann weyl 1885–1955 , satyendra nath bose 1894-1974 , norbert wiener 1894–1964 , john lighton synge ( 1897–1995 ) , wolfgang pauli 1900–1958 , paul dirac 1902–1984 , eugene wigner 1902–1995 , andrey kolmogorov 1903-1987 , lars onsager 1903-1976 , john von neumann 1903–1957 , sin-itiro tomonaga 1906–1979 , hideki yukawa 1907–1981 , nikolay bogolyubov 1909–1992 , subrahmanyan chandrasekhar 1910-1995 , mark kac 1914–1984 , julian schwinger 1918–1994 , richard feynman 1918–1988 , irving ezra segal 1918–1998 , ryogo kubo 1920–1995 , arthur strong wightman 1922–2013 , chen-ning yang 1922– , rudolf haag 1922–2016 , freeman dyson 1923–2020 , martin gutzwiller 1925–2014 , abdus salam 1926–1996 , jürgen moser 1928–1999 , michael atiyah 1929–2019 , joel lebowitz 1930– , roger penrose 1931– , elliott h . lieb 1932– , sheldon lee glashow 1932– , steven weinberg 1933– , ludvig faddeev 1934–2017 , david ruelle 1935– , yakov sinai 1935– , vladimir arnold 1937–2010 , arthur jaffe 1937– , roman jackiw 1939– , leonard susskind 1940– , rodney baxter 1940– , michael victor berry 1941- , giovanni gallavotti 1941- , stephen hawking 1942–2018 , jerrold e . marsden 1942–2010 , alexander markovich polyakov 1945– , john cardy 1947– , giorgio parisi 1948– , edward witten 1951– , herbert spohn 1951 ? – , ashoke sen 1956- and juan martín maldacena 1968– .
