management accountants ( cima ) , and the chartered institute of public finance and accountancy ( cipfa ) united states ( american institute of certified public accountants ( aicpa ) ) membership of the committee ( later known as the board ) was on an institutional , not at an individual basis . each institution represented on the board could send a delegation of two representatives and a staff observer to committee meetings . each delegation wielded one vote . according to the iasc 's original constitution , membership was limited to the founding member bodies . other accountancy bodies could join as associate members . this allowed them to propose members for working parties and so to contribute to the setting of the standards , but did not give them representation or a vote at board meetings . in 1977 , the iasc 's constitution was changed to allow for the appointment of two additional board members for four-year terms , on a rotating basis . in a further change to the constitution in 1982 , the terms of all board members were limited to five years . the distinction between founding and associate members was abolished , as all member bodies of the international federation of accountants ( ifac ) became members of the iasc . board members were since then appointed by the ifac council . because of an agreement reached in 1981 between ifac and the iasc , the founding member bodies continued to be reappointed ( with the exception of mexico in 1987 ) and de facto retained their permanent seats . camfferman and zeff , 2007 , chapters 6 and 7 . under these arrangements , the following changes in board membership took place : camfferman and zeff , 2007 , chapters 4 , 6 , 8 ; appendix 3 . the national council of chartered accountants ( south africa , subsequently known as the south african institute of chartered accountants , saica ) became an associate member in 1974 and joined the board in 1978 . because of continued reappointments , south africa became in effect a permanent member of the board . in 1995 the south africans began sharing their representation on the board with the institute of chartered accountants of zimbabwe . the institute of chartered accountants of nigeria became an associate member in 1976 and was a member of the board from 1979 to 1987 . the consiglio nazionale dei dottori commercialisti ( italy ) joined the iasc board in 1983 and remained until 1995 . the national federation of certified public accountants associations of the republic of china became a member of ifac council in 1983 and in 1984 began a three-year term as the second accountancy body from east asia , after japan , represented on the iasc board . denmark became a member in 1988 , replaced in 1990 by the nordic federation of public accountants ( represented by danes , swedes and norwegians , since the fins and icelandics were not interested in participating ) . korea sent a delegation from 1988 to 1992 . a jordanian delegation served on the board from 1989 to 1995 which was constituted by the arab society of certified accountants . the institute of chartered accountants of india ( icai ) became an associate member in 1974 and joined the board in 1993 . in 1995 , india began sharing the delegation with the institute of chartered accountants of sri lanka . the malaysian association of certified public accountants became an associate member in 1975 ( later joined by the institut akauntan malaysia , the malaysian institute of accountants ) , and was a member of the board from 1995 to 2000 . between 1973 and the change in the iasc 's constitution which made all ifac members iasc members , a total of 46 accountancy bodies were admitted as associate members , camfferman and zeff , 2007 , p . 73 . including : camfferman and zeff , 2007 , p . 177-180 . the new zealand society of accountants ( 1974 ) ; the institute of chartered accountants of pakistan and the pakistan institute of industrial accountants ( 1974 ) ; the singapore society of accountants ( 1975 ) ; the hong kong society of accountants ( 1975 ) . the iasc 's constitution as revised in 1982 provided for a limited expansion of the board 's membership beyond the organized accountancy profession . up to four organizations having an interest in financial reporting could now be invited to be represented on the board . as a result , three non-auditor delegations were added over time , all remaining on the board until the end of the iasc : 1986 : the international co-ordinating committee of financial analysts associations ( since 1988 known as the international council of investment associations ) . 1995 : the federation of swiss industrial holding companies . 1996 : the international association of financial executives institutes . organization . at the core of the iasc was the committee , or board , consisting of delegations from the member bodies . the board typically met three to four times a year for two or three days in locations around the world . it was served by a permanent secretariat based in london . the technical agenda of the board was prepared by working groups known as steering committees , each appointed to develop proposals for a new or modified standard on a specific topic . steering committee membership was on an individual , not institutional , basis , but appointment was based on recommendation by an iasc member body , industry organization or similar grouping . from the start , the iasc adopted the practice of issuing draft standards ( exposure drafts ) for public comment before agreeing on a final standard . this allowed a degree of wider participation in the standard-setting work even though in practice a large proportion of the responses came from accountancy bodies , audit firms and national accounting standard setters . in 1981 , the iasc established a consultative group , with a view to engaging a broader set of organizations in its work . in 1996 , the iasc set up a standing interpretations committee ( sic ) , charged with issuing interpretations of standards on relatively narrow issues arising in practice . leadership of the iasc was provided by the chairman of the board and head of the secretariat ( the secretary , known since 1984 as secretary-general ) : camfferman and zeff , 2007 , appendix 2 . chairmen of the iasc . sir henry benson ( uk , 1973-1976 ) joseph cummings ( usa , 1976-1978 ) john hepworth ( australia , 1978-1980 ) hans burggraaff ( the netherlands , 1980-1982 ) stephen elliott ( canada , 1982-1985 ) john kirkpatrick ( uk , 1985-1987 ) george

standards , each dealing with a specific financial reporting topic . over time , standards were amended or replaced . when the iasc was replaced by the iasb , 34 standards were still extant and adopted by the iasb . the original aim of the iasc was to issue 'basic ' standards . camfferman and zeff , 2007 , p . 51 . in practice , this meant that the standards often reflected common , rather than best practices in the board member countries . several standards contained alternative treatments ( options ) , reflecting the diversity of practice . for instance , ias 2 valuation and presentation of inventories in the context of the historical cost system ( 1975 ) allowed a variety of practices including the lifo , fifo and base stock methods . for this reason , the iasc was sometimes criticized for taking a 'lowest common denominator ' approach . however , some of the early standards prescribed practices that were not yet commonly followed in many countries , including several board member countries . ias 3 consolidated financial statements and the equity method of accounting ( 1976 ) required the presentation of consolidated financial statements by parents of subsidiary companies . this was well before the seventh company law directive ( 1983 ) made this mandatory in the member states of the european economic community . ias 17 accounting for leases ( 1982 ) required the capitalization of finance leases , a practice that was as yet unusual or unknown outside the united states . camfferman and zeff , 2007 , p . 128 . in 1987 , the iasc adopted a new strategy of strengthening its standards to make them a suitable basis for financial reporting by companies seeking cross-border stock market listings . camfferman and zeff , 2007 , chapter 9 . in doing so , it was encouraged by the international organization of securities commissions ( iosco ) which in 1988 signaled its willingness to consider an improved set of ias as the basis for preparing financial information in multinational prospectuses . camfferman and zeff , 2007 , p . 302 . as us capital markets were among the most important in the world , this meant above all that the iasc had to bring its standards more in line with us generally accepted accounting principles ( us gaap ) in order to gain acceptance by the us securities and exchange commission ( sec ) , a key iosco member . in 1987 , the iasc embarked on a project to revise its extant standards . the revisions included the elimination of options , the expansion of disclosure requirements and additional guidance for the application of the standards . the revisions were completed in 1992 . as this did not yet satisfy iosco , the iasc embarked on a new work programme to revise its standards , and to add standards on topics that were not yet , or only partially covered , such as accounting for financial instruments . this 'core standards ' programme was completed under strong time pressure in 1998 with the publication of ias 39 financial instruments : recognition and measurement . impact . according to the iasc 's constitution , the member bodies were committed to use their 'best endeavours ' with reporting companies , their auditors , governments and securities market regulators to ensure that published financial statements complied with ias , and that audit reports referred to any non-compliance . camfferman and zeff , 2007 , p . 500 . in the absence of large-scale global surveys of corporate reporting practices for the 1970s and 1980s , it is not possible to assess with any degree of precision to what degree reporting companies adopted ias . in the early 1980s , a number of canadian listed companies began to assert compliance with ias in their financial statements , but this seems to have been the case in few other countries . camfferman and zeff , 2007 , p . 166 and chapter 6 . one explanation of this limited direct impact is that in most countries , national accountancy bodies had no authority to force companies to adopt ias . camfferman and zeff , 2007 , p . 181 . this does not rule out an indirect influence of ias , as national accounting standards in a range of countries incorporated elements of the national standards in national requirements . camfferman and zeff , 2007 , chapter 6 . the efforts of the iasc , from 1987 onwards , to improve its standards in order to make them an acceptable basis for cross-border listings led to greater recognition . during the 1990s , a number of major european companies began to prepare financial statements on the basis of us gaap because of actual or planned listings in the united states . others adopted ias which was increasingly seen as a set of standards of sufficient quality for international capital markets . in 1998 , german companies were allowed to satisfy their legal reporting requirements in germany by publishing consolidated financial statements based on 'internationally recognized principles of accounting ' , which in practice meant either us gaap or ias . camfferman and zeff , 2007 , p . 413 .
