early novels in english . the english novel has generally been seen as beginning with daniel defoe 's robinson crusoe ( 1719 ) and moll flanders ( 1722 ) , '' defoe '' , the oxford companion to english literature , ed . margaret drabble . ( oxford : oxforsd university press,1996 ) , p . 265 . though john bunyan 's the pilgrim 's progress ( 1678 ) and aphra behn 's oroonoko ( 1688 ) are also contenders , while earlier works such as sir thomas malory 's morte d'arthur , and even the '' prologue '' to geoffrey chaucer 's canterbury tales have been suggested . j . a . cuddon , a dictionary of literary terms ( harmondsworth : penguin books , 1984 ) , pp . 433 , 434 . another important early novel is gulliver 's travels ( 1726 , amended 1735 ) , by irish writer and clergyman jonathan swift , which is both a satire of human nature , as well as a parody of travellers ' tales like robinson crusoe . the rise of the novel as an important literary genre is generally associated with the growth of the middle class in england . other major 18th-century english novelists are samuel richardson ( 1689–1761 ) , author of the epistolary novels pamela , or virtue rewarded ( 1740 ) and clarissa ( 1747–48 ) ; henry fielding ( 1707–1754 ) , who wrote joseph andrews ( 1742 ) and the history of tom jones , a foundling ( 1749 ) ; laurence sterne ( 1713–1768 ) , who published tristram shandy in parts between 1759 and 1767 ; the oxford companion to english literature , p . 947 . oliver goldsmith ( 1728–1774 ) , author of the vicar of wakefield ( 1766 ) ; tobias smollett ( 1721–1771 ) , a scottish novelist best known for his comic picaresque novels , such as the adventures of peregrine pickle ( 1751 ) and the expedition of humphry clinker ( 1771 ) , who influenced charles dickens ; and fanny burney ( 1752–1840 ) , whose novels '' were enjoyed and admired by jane austen , '' wrote evelina ( 1778 ) , cecilia ( 1782 ) and camilla ( 1796 ) . the oxford companion to english literature , ed margaret drabble . ( oxford : oxford university press,1996 ) , p . 151 . a noteworthy aspect of both the 18th- and 19th- century novel is the way the novelist directly addressed the reader . for example , the author might interrupt his or her narrative to pass judgment on a character , or pity or praise another , and inform or remind the reader of some other relevant issue . romantic period . the phrase 'romantic novel ' has several possible meanings . here it refers to novels written during the romantic era in literary history , which runs from the late 18th century until the beginning of the victorian era in 1837 . but to complicate matters there are novels written in the romance tradition by novelists like walter scott , nathaniel hawthorne , george meredith . j . a . cuddon , a dictionary of literary terms .

( 1996 ) . v is for vampire , p . 99 . new york : plume . among more minor novelists in this period maria edgeworth ( 1768–1849 ) and thomas love peacock ( 1785–1866 ) are worthy of comment . edgeworth 's novel castle rackrent ( 1800 ) is '' the first fully developed regional novel in english '' as well as '' the first true historical novel in english '' and an important influence on walter scott . the oxford companion to english literature , p . 310 . peacock was primarily a satirist in novels such as nightmare abbey ( 1818 ) and the misfortunes of elphin ( 1829 ) . jane austen 's ( 1775–1817 ) works critique the sentimental novel of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism . litz , pp . 3–14 ; grundy , '' jane austen and literary traditions '' , the cambridge companion to jane austen , pp . 192–193 ; waldron , '' critical responses , early '' , jane austen in context , pp . 83 , 89–90 ; duffy , '' criticism , 1814–1870 '' , the jane austen companion , pp . 93–94 . her plots , though fundamentally comic , highlight the dependence of women on marriage to secure social standing and economic security . a . walton litz , jane austen : a study of her development . new york : oxford university press , 1965 . p . 142 ; oliver macdonagh , jane austen : real and imagined worlds . new haven : yale university press , 1991 . pp . 66–75 ; collins , 160–161 . austen brings to light the hardships women faced , who usually did not inherit money , could not work and where their only chance in life depended on the man they married . she reveals not only the difficulties women faced in her day , but also what was expected of men and of the careers they had to follow . this she does with wit and humour and with endings where all characters , good or bad , receive exactly what they deserve . her work brought her little personal fame and only a few positive reviews during her lifetime , but the publication in 1869 of her nephew 's a memoir of jane austen introduced her to a wider public , and by the 1940s she had become accepted as a major writer . the second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of austen scholarship and the emergence of a janeite fan culture . austen 's works include pride and prejudice ( 1813 ) sense and sensibility ( 1811 ) , mansfield park , persuasion and emma . the other major novelist at the beginning of the early 19th century was sir walter scott ( 1771–1832 ) , who was not only a highly successful british novelist but '' the greatest single influence on fiction in the 19th century . and a european figure '' . j . a . cuddon , p . 435 . scott established the genre of the historical novel with his series of waverley novels , including waverley ( 1814 ) , the antiquary ( 1816 ) , and the heart of midlothian ( 1818 ) . the oxford companion to english literature , p . 890 . however , austen is today widely read and the source for films and television series , while scott is less often read . victorian novel . it was in the victorian era ( 1837–1901 ) that the novel became the leading literary genre in english . a number of women novelists were successful in the 19th century , although they often had to use a masculine pseudonym . at the beginning of the 19th century most novels were published in three volumes . however , monthly serialization was revived with the publication of charles dickens ' pickwick papers in twenty parts between april 1836 and november 1837 . demand was high for each episode to introduce some new element , whether it was a plot twist or a new character , so as to maintain the readers ' interest . both dickens and thackeray frequently published this way . the bloomsbury guide to english literature , ed . marion wynne-davies . ( new york : prentice hall , 1990 ) , pp . 97–8 . the 1830s and 1840s saw the rise of social novel , also known as social problem novel , that '' arose out of the social and political upheavals which followed the reform act of 1832 '' . bloomsbury guide , p . 101 . this was in many ways a reaction to rapid industrialization , and the social , political and economic issues associated with it , and was a means of commenting on abuses of government and industry and the suffering of the poor , who were not profiting from england 's economic prosperity . '' james , louis ( 2006 ) '' stories of the working class poor were directed toward middle class to help create sympathy and promote change . an early example is charles dickens ' oliver twist ( 1837–38 ) . charles dickens emerged on the literary scene in the 1830s with the two novels already mentioned . dickens wrote vividly about london life and struggles of the poor , but in a good-humoured fashion , accessible to readers of all classes . one of his most popular works to this day is a christmas carol ( 1843 ) . in more recent years dickens has been most admired for his later novels , such as dombey and son ( 1846–48 ) , great expectations ( 1860–61 ) , bleak house ( 1852–53 ) and little dorrit ( 1855–57 ) and our mutual friend ( 1864–65 ) . an early rival to dickens was william makepeace thackeray , who during the victorian period ranked second only to him , but he is now much less read and is known almost exclusively for vanity fair ( 1847 ) . in that novel he satirizes whole swaths of humanity while retaining a light touch . it features his most memorable character , the engagingly roguish becky sharp . the brontë sisters were other significant novelists in the 1840s and 1850s . their novels caused a sensation when they were first published but were subsequently accepted as classics . they had written compulsively from early childhood and were first published , at their own expense in 1846 as poets under the pseudonyms currer , ellis and acton bell . the sisters returned to prose , producing a novel each the following year : charlotte 's jane eyre , emily 's wuthering heights and anne 's agnes grey . later , anne 's the tenant of wildfell hall ( 1848 ) and charlotte 's villette ( 1853 ) were published . elizabeth gaskell was also a successful writer and first novel , mary barton , was published anonymously in 1848 . gaskell 's north and south contrasts the lifestyle in the industrial north of england with the wealthier south . even though her writing conforms to victorian conventions , gaskell usually frames her stories as critiques of contemporary attitudes : her early works focused on factory work in the midlands . she always emphasised the role of women , with complex narratives and dynamic female characters . abrams , m.h . , et al .
