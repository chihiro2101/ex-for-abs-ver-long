Prostitution in Nevada

history . brothels have been allowed in nevada since the middle of the 19th century . in 1937 , a law was enacted to require weekly health checks of all prostitutes . in 1942 , president franklin d . roosevelt issued an order to suppress prostitution near military basesâ€”affecting the red-light districts of reno and las vegas . when this order was lifted in 1948 , reno officials tried to shut down a brothel as a public nuisance ; this action was upheld by the nevada supreme court in 1949 . in 1951 , both reno and las vegas had closed their red-light districts as public nuisances , but brothels continued to exist throughout the state . in 1971 , joe conforte , owner of a brothel called mustang ranch , near reno , managed to convince county officials to pass an ordinance which would provide for the licensing of brothels and prostitutes , thus avoiding the threat of being closed down as a public nuisance . officials in las vegas , afraid that conforte would use the same technique to open a brothel nearby , convinced the legislature , in 1971 , to pass a law prohibiting the legalization of prostitution in counties with a population above a certain threshold , tailored to apply only to clark county . in 1977 , county officials in nye county tried to shut down walter plankinton 's chicken ranch as a public nuisance ; brothels did not have to be licensed in that county at the time , and several others were operating . plankinton filed suit , claiming that the 1971 state law had implicitly removed the assumption that brothels are public nuisances per se . the nevada supreme court agreed with this interpretation in 1978 , and so the chicken ranch was allowed to operate . in another case , brothel owners in lincoln county protested when the county outlawed prostitution in 1978 , having issued licenses for seven years . the nevada supreme court ruled , however , that the county had the right to do so . a state law prohibiting the advertising of brothels in counties which have outlawed prostitution was enacted in 1979 . it was promptly challenged on first amendment grounds , but in 1981 , the nevada supreme court declared it to be constitutional . ( princess sea industries , one of the parties involved in the case , was plankinton 's company that owned the chicken ranch . ) in july 2007 , the law was overturned by a u.s . district judge as '' overly broad '' , and advertising in las vegas started soon after . chicken ranch brothel finally to advertise in las vegas , lasvegasnow.com , august 31 , 2007 ban lifted , nevada 's legal brothels can now advertise , san diego tribune , july 29 , 2007 . in march 2010 , the district judge 's decision was reversed back by a three-judge panel of the u.s . ninth circuit court of appeals . the aclu appealed to the en banc in march 2010 . it further appealed to the supreme court of the united states in 2011 , but the supreme court refused to hear the appeal . the ban on brothels advertising therefore remains in force . while brothels and prostitutes are subject to federal income tax and also pay local fees , nevada has no state income tax , and brothels are exempt from the state entertainment tax and do not pay any other state taxes . in 2005 , brothel owners lobbied to be taxed in order to increase the legitimacy of the business , but the legislature declined . hennessy , kathleen .
