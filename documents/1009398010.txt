similar principles in their own free nation . lord kitchener , a largely known calypsonian , became noted for his politically critical lyrics in his music . kitchener used calypso to shed light on the grievances of the windrush generation , a generation of caribbean families migrating from the islands to england in response to increased labor demands after world war ii . kitchener ’ s 1948 song “ windrush ” was written in two versions . the first version gained more global popularity as the lyrics expressed gratitude and appreciation of british rule . however , second version found greater popularity amongst caribbean people themselves as the lyrics conveyed a story of exile , oppression and inequality living in england . although kitchener ’ s alternate version of “ windrush ” did not
