the dome represents a house on earth . the tralfamadorians later abduct a pornographic film star named montana wildhack , who had disappeared on earth and was believed to have drowned herself in san pedro bay . they intend to have her mate with billy . she and billy fall in love and have a child together . billy is instantaneously sent back to earth in a time warp to relive past or future moments of his life . in 1968 , billy and a co-pilot are the only survivors of a plane crash in vermont . while driving to visit billy in the hospital , valencia crashes her car and dies of carbon monoxide poisoning . billy shares a hospital room with bertram rumfoord , a harvard university history professor researching an official history of the war . they discuss the bombing of dresden , which the professor initially refuses to believe billy witnessed ; the professor claims that the bombing of dresden was justified despite the great loss of civilian lives and the complete destruction of the city . billy 's daughter takes him home to ilium . he escapes and flees to new york city . in times square he visits a pornographic book store , where he discovers books written by kilgore trout and reads them . among the books he discovers a book entitled the broad board , about a couple abducted by aliens and tricked into managing the aliens ' investments on earth . he also finds a number of magazine covers noting the disappearance of montana wildhack , who happens to be featured in a pornographic film being shown in the store . later in the evening , when he discusses his time travels to tralfamadore on a talk radio , he is evicted from the studio . he returns to his hotel room , falls asleep , and time-travels back to 1945 in dresden . billy and his fellow prisoners are tasked with locating and burying the dead . after a maori new zealand soldier working with billy dies of dry heaves the germans begin cremating the bodies en masse with flamethrowers . billy 's friend edgar derby is shot for stealing a teapot . eventually all of the german soldiers leave to fight on the eastern front , leaving billy and the other prisoners alone with tweeting birds as the war ends . due to the non-chronological storytelling , other parts of billy 's life are told throughout the book . after billy is evicted from the radio studio , barbara treats billy as a child and often monitors him . robert becomes starkly anti-communism and a green beret in the vietnam war . billy eventually dies in 1976 , in which the united states has been partitioned into twenty separate countries and attacked by china with thermonuclear weapons . he gives a speech in a baseball park in chicago in which he predicts his own death and proclaims that '' if you think death is a terrible thing , then you have not understood a word i 've said . '' billy is soon after shot with a laser gun by an assassin commissioned by the elderly lazzaro . characters . narrator : recurring as a minor character , the narrator seems anonymous while also clearly identifying himself as kurt vonnegut , when he says , '' that was i . that was me . that was the author of this book . '' as noted above , as an american soldier during world war ii , vonnegut was captured by germans at the battle of the bulge and transported to dresden . he and fellow prisoners-of-war survived the bombing while being held in a deep cellar of schlachthof fünf ( '' slaughterhouse-five '' ) . the narrator begins the story by describing his connection to the firebombing of dresden and his reasons for writing slaughterhouse-five . billy pilgrim : a fatalistic optometrist ensconced in a dull , safe marriage in ilium , new york . during world war ii , he was held as a prisoner-of-war in dresden and survived the firebombing , experiences which had a lasting effect on his post-war life . his time travel occurs at desperate times in his life ; he relives past and future events and becomes fatalistic ( though not a defeatist ) because he claims to have seen when , how , and why he will die . roland weary : a weak man dreaming of grandeur and obsessed with gore and vengeance , who saves billy several times ( despite billy 's protests ) in hopes of attaining military glory . he coped with his unpopularity in his home city of pittsburgh by befriending and then beating people less well-liked then him , and is obsessed with his father 's collection of torture equipment . weary is also a bully who beats billy and gets them both captured , leading to the loss of his winter uniforms and boots . weary dies of gangrene on the train en route to the pow camp , and blames billy in his dying words . paul lazzaro : another pow . a sickly , ill-tempered car thief from cicero , illinois who takes weary 's dying words as a revenge commission to kill billy . he keeps a mental list of his enemies , claiming he can have anyone '' killed for a thousand dollars plus traveling expenses . '' lazzaro eventually fulfills his promise to weary and has billy assassinated by a laser gun in 1976 . kilgore trout : a failed science fiction writer whose hometown is also ilium , new york , and who makes money by managing paperboy . he has received only one fan mail ( from eliot rosewater ; see below ) . after billy meets him in a back alley in ilium , he invites trout to his wedding anniversary celebration . there , kilgore follows billy , thinking the latter has seen through a '' time window . '' kilgore trout is also a main character in vonnegut 's 1973 novel breakfast of champions . edgar derby : a middle-aged high school teacher who felt that he needed to participate in the war rather than just send off his students to fight . though relatively unimportant , he seems to be the only american before the bombing of dresden to understand what war can do to people . during campbell 's presentation he stands up and castigates him , defending american democracy and the alliance with the soviet union . german forces summarily execute him for looting after they catch him taking a kettle from the street wreckage after the bombing . vonnegut has said that this death is the climax of the book as a whole . howard w . campbell jr . : an american-born nazi . before the war , he lived in germany where he was a noted german language playwright recruited by the nazi ministry of propaganda . in an essay , he connects the misery of american poverty to the disheveled appearance and behavior of the american pows . edgar derby confronts him when campbell tries to recruit american pows into the freikorps to fight the communist soviet union on behalf of the nazis . he appears wearing swastika-adorned cowboy hat and boots and with a red , white , and blue nazi armband . campbell is the protagonist of vonnegut 's 1962 novel mother night . valencia merble : billy 's wife and the mother of their children , robert and barbara . billy is emotionally distant from her . she dies from carbon monoxide poisoning after an automobile accident en route to the hospital to see billy after his airplane crash . robert pilgrim : son of billy and valencia . a troubled , middle-class boy and disappointing son who becomes an alcoholic at age 16 , drops out of high school , and is arrested for vandalizing a catholic cemetery . he later so absorbs the anti-communism worldview that he metamorphoses from suburban adolescent rebel to green beret sergeant . he wins a purple heart , bronze star , and silver star in the vietnam war . barbara pilgrim : daughter of billy and valencia . she is a '' bitchy flibbertigibbet '' from having had to assume the family 's leadership at the age of twenty . she has '' legs like an edwardian grand piano '' , marries an optometrist , and treats her widowed father as a childish invalid . tralfamadore : the race of extraterrestrial beings who appear ( to humans ) like upright toilet plungers with a hand atop , in which is set a single green eye . they abduct billy and teach him about time 's relation to the world ( as a fourth dimension ) , fate , and the nature of death . the tralfamadorians are featured in several vonnegut novels . in slaughterhouse five , they reveal that the universe will be accidentally destroyed by one of their test pilots , and there is nothing they can do about it . montana wildhack : a beautiful young model who is abducted and placed alongside billy in the zoo on tralfamadore . she and billy develop an intimate relationship and they have a child . she apparently remains on tralfamadore with the child after billy is sent back to earth . billy sees her in a film showing in a pornographic book store when he stops to look at the kilgore trout novels sitting in the window . her unexplained disappearance is featured on the covers of magazines sold in the store . '' wild bob '' : a superannuated army officer billy meets in the war . he tells his fellow pows to call him '' wild bob '' , as he thinks they are the 451st infantry regiment and under his command . he explains '' if you 're ever in cody , wyoming , ask for wild bob '' , which is a phrase that billy repeats to himself throughout the novel . he dies of pneumonia . eliot rosewater : billy befriends him in the veterans ' hospital ; he introduces billy to the sci-fi novels of kilgore trout . rosewater wrote the only fan letter trout ever received . rosewater had also suffered a terrible event during the war . billy and rosewater find the trout novels helpful in dealing with the trauma of war . rosewater is featured in other vonnegut novels , such as god bless you , mr . rosewater ( 1965 ) . bertram copeland rumfoord : a harvard history professor , retired u.s . air force brigadier general , and millionaire . he shares a hospital room with billy and is interested in the dresden bombing . he is in the hospital after breaking his leg on his honeymoon with his fifth wife lily , a barely literate high school drop-out and go-go girl . he is described as similar in appearance and mannerisms to theodore roosevelt . bertram is likely a relative of winston niles rumfoord , a character in vonnegut 's 1959 novel the sirens of titan . the scouts : two american infantry scouts trapped behind german lines who find roland weary and billy . roland refers to himself and the scouts as the '' three musketeers '' . the scouts abandon roland and billy because the latter are slowing them down . they are revealed to have been shot and killed by germans in ambush . bernard v . o'hare : the narrator 's old war friend who was also held in dresden and accompanies him there after the war . he is the husband of mary o'hare , and is a district attorney from pennsylvania . mary o'hare : the wife of bernard v . o'hare , to whom vonnegut promised to name the book the children 's crusade . she is briefly discussed in the beginning of the book . when the narrator and bernard try to recollect their war experiences mary complains that they were just '' babies '' during the war and that the narrator will portray them as valorous men . the narrator befriends mary by promising that he will portray them as she said and that in his book '' there wo n't be a part for frank sinatra or john wayne . '' werner gluck : the sixteen-year-old german charged with guarding billy and edgar derby when they are first placed at slaughterhouse five in dresden . he does not know his way around and accidentally leads billy and edgar into a communal shower where some german refugee girls from wrocław are bathing . he is described as appearing similar to billy . style . the novel is simple in syntax and sentence structure , part of vonnegut 's signature style . likewise , irony , sentimentality , black humor , and didacticism are prevalent throughout the work . westbrook , perry d . '' kurt vonnegut jr . : overview . '' contemporary novelists . susan windisch brown . 6th ed . new york : st . james press , 1996 . like much of his oeuvre , slaughterhouse-five is broken into small pieces , and in this case , brief experiences in one point in time . vonnegut himself has claimed his books '' are essentially mosaics made up of a whole bunch of tiny little chips.and each chip is a joke . '' vonnegut also includes hand-drawn illustrations , a technique he repeated in his next novel , breakfast of champions ( 1973 ) . characteristically , vonnegut makes heavy use of repetition , frequently using the phrase '' so it goes '' : as a refrain when events of death , dying , and mortality occur or are mentioned , as a narrative transition to another subject , as a memento mori , as comic relief , and to explain the unexplained . it appears 106 times . the book has been classified as a postmodern , metafictional novel . the first chapter of slaughterhouse-five is written in the style of an author 's preface about how he came to write the novel . the narrator introduces the novel 's genesis by telling of his connection to the dresden bombing , and why he is recording it . he gives a description of himself and the book , saying that it is a desperate attempt at scholarly work . he ends the first chapter by discussing the beginning and end of the novel . he then segues to the story of billy pilgrim : '' listen : billy pilgrim has come unstuck in time '' , thus the transition from the writer 's perspective to that of the third-person , omniscient narrator . ( the use of '' listen '' as an opening interjection mimics the epic poem beowulf . ) the fictional '' story '' appears to begin in chapter two , although there is no reason to presume that the first chapter is not fiction . this technique is common to postmodern meta-fiction . waugh , patricia . metafiction : the theory and practice of self-conscious fiction . new york : routledge , 1988 . p . 22 . the story purports to be a disjointed narrative , from billy pilgrim 's point of view , of being unstuck in time . vonnegut 's writing usually contains such disorder . he apologizes for the novel being '' so short and jumbled and jangled , '' but says '' there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre . '' the narrator reports that billy pilgrim experiences his life discontinuously , so that he randomly lives ( and relives ) his birth , youth , old age , and death , rather than in customary linear order . there are two main narrative threads : billy 's wartime period ( interrupted with episodes from other periods and places in his life ) , which is mostly linear , and his discontinuous pre-war and post-war lives . billy 's existential perspective was compromised by his witnessing dresden 's destruction , although he had come '' unstuck in time '' before arriving in the city . he first time-trips while escaping the germans , in the ardennes forest . exhausted , he fell asleep against a tree and re-lives events from his future . slaughterhouse-five is told in short , declarative sentences , which suggest the sense of reading a report of facts . the first sentence says , '' all this happened , more or less . '' ( in 2010 this was ranked no . 38 on the american book reviews list of '' 100 best first lines from novels . '' ) the opening sentences of the novel have been said to contain the aesthetic '' method statement '' of the entire novel . the author later appears as a sick fellow prisoner in billy pilgrim 's world war ii . the narrator notes this saying , '' that was i . that was me . that was the author of this book . '' the story repeatedly refers to real and fictional novels and other works of fiction ; billy reads valley of the dolls ( 1966 ) , skims a tralfamadorian book , and participates in a radio talk show , part of a literary-expert panel discussing '' the death of the novel '' . kilgore trout , whom billy pilgrim meets while operating a newspaper delivery business , can be seen as vonnegut 's alter ego , though the two differ in some respects . trout 's career as a science fiction novelist is checkered with thieving publishers , and the fictional author is unaware of his readership . religion and philosophy . christian philosophy . one major philosophy presented in vonnegut 's novel is christianity . the novel discusses topics within christianity , especially in regards to fate and free will . billy pilgrim experiences and applies these principles . the role of religion in the life of billy pilgrim is a key point in slaughterhouse-five . toward the beginning of the novel the narrator states that pilgrim started out in the world war ii as a chaplain 's assistant '' and had a meek faith in a loving jesus which most soldiers found putrid . '' this understanding of the christian jesus is challenged after the war as pilgrim comes in contact with the work of kilgore trout 's novel the gospel from outer space . trout 's fictional novel within slaughterhouse-five explores the journey of a visitor from outer space who studies christianity to determine '' why christians found it so easy to be cruel . '' this '' cruel christianity '' presents a direct contrast to billy 's loving jesus . taking some of trout 's novel to heart , the narrator and billy pilgrim look to create a new sense of christianity and a more human-like jesus . the idea of the human-jesus is a central piece in analyzing pilgrim 's eventual struggle with fate and free will . establishing a christian figure that is not initially divine in nature sets a completely different tone to the overall understanding of humanity 's placement with god . in david vanderwerken 's piece '' kurt vonnegut 's slaughterhouse-five at forty : billy pilgrim - even more a man of our time , '' vanderwerken states that the narrator may be calling for a '' humanly centered christianity in which jesus is a 'nobody ' ( 94 ) , a 'bum ' ( 95 ) , a man . '' what vonnegut suggests here is that christ 's divinity stands in the way of charity . if the '' bum '' is everyman , then we are all adopted children of god ; we are all christs and should treat each other accordingly.… if jesus is human , then he is imperfect and must necessarily be involved in direct or indirect evil . this jesus participates fully in the human condition . there is some question of christ 's divinity and how that plays a part in christian principles and it is suggested that the voice in the novel desires a form of collectivism where humanity looks at one another as equal parts and equal heirs of god . this human-jesus argument within the novel stands as an effort to make humanity , whom trout may consider to be '' bums '' and '' nobodies '' , have more importance . the narration 's call for a more human-jesus and christianity is seen in the last part of the discussion on trout 's novel where god speaks from heaven stating , '' from this moment on , he god will punish horribly anybody who torments a bum who has no connections ! '' trout 's novel attempts to make everybody somebody , as well as to emphasize the supposed cruelty of medieval christian thinking , and how it ought to be changed . the desire for a '' human '' jesus is not the only biblical topic discussed in the novel . another reference involves the story of lot 's wife disobeying and turning to look back at the destruction of sodom and gomorrah . the narrator of that chapter , possibly seen as vonnegut himself , claims that he loves lot 's wife doing so '' because it was so human . '' amanda wicks speaks on this incorporation of lot 's wife and the narrating voice stating , '' vonnegut naturally aligns himself with lot 's wife since both occupy the role of spectators shattered by the act of witnessing . '' the narrator 's alignment with lot 's wife also creates a good pretext for the understanding of billy pilgrim 's psyche throughout the destruction of dresden . along with asking moral questions , slaughterhouse-five is also a novel that focuses on the philosophies of fate and free will . in the novel , billy pilgrim tries to determine what his role in life is and what the purpose of everything going on around him is as well . when abducted by the tralfamadorians , pilgrim asks them why he is chosen from among all the others . he questions the fate of the situation and what led up to that point . billy pilgrim considers his fate and actions to be a part of a larger network of actions , his future manipulated by one thing over another based on decision . all things that happen would happen for a reason . indeed , pilgrim 's beginning mindset would suggest that he believed in free will , fate , whys , decisions and things happening for reasons . however , many of these thoughts are quickly challenged by the tralfamadorians ' ideology . tralfamadorian philosophy . as billy pilgrim becomes '' unstuck in time '' , he is faced with a new type of philosophy . when pilgrim becomes acquainted with the tralfamadorians , he learns a different viewpoint concerning fate and free will . while christianity may state that fate and free will are matters of god 's divine choice and human interaction , tralfamadorianism would disagree . according to tralfamadorian philosophy , things are and always will be , and there is nothing that can change them . when billy asks why they had chosen him , the tralfamadorians reply , '' why you ? why us for that matter ? why anything ? because this moment simply is . '' the mindset of the tralfamadorian is not one in which free will exists . things happen because they were always destined to be happening . the narrator of the story explains that the tralfamadorians see time all at once . this concept of time is best explained by the tralfamadorians themselves , as they speak to billy pilgrim on the matter stating , '' i am a tralfamadorian , seeing all time as you might see a stretch of the rocky mountains . all time is all time . it does not change . it does not lend itself to warnings or explanations . it simply is . '' after this particular conversation on seeing time , billy makes the statement that this philosophy does not seem to evoke any sense of free will . to this , the tralfamadorian reply that free will is a concept that , out of the '' visited thirty-one inhabited planets in the universe '' and '' studied reports on one hundred more '' , exists solely on earth . using the tralfamadorian passivity of fate , billy pilgrim learns to overlook death and the shock involved with death . pilgrim claims the tralfamadorian philosophy on death to be his most important lesson : the most important thing i learned on tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die . he is still very much alive in the past , so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral . all moments , past , present , and future , always have existed , always will exist . when a tralfamadorian sees a corpse , all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in that particular moment , but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments . now , when i myself hear that somebody is dead , i simply shrug and say what the tralfamadorians say about dead people , which is '' so it goes . '' billy pilgrim continues throughout the novel to use the term '' so it goes '' as it relates to death . the ideas behind death , fate , time , and free will are drastically different when compared to those of christianity . tralfamadorian philosophy did not appear ex nihilo , but draws on many strands of thought . the idea of all time existing at once ( as the tralfamadorians experience it ) can be found in sources ranging from pre-socratic greek philosophy ( e.g . parmenides ' monism ) hoy , ronald c . '' parmenides ' complete rejection of time . '' the journal of philosophy , vol . 91 , no . 11 , 1994 , pp . 573–598 . to neo-classical christian theology ( e.g . sir thomas browne 's religio medici ) to twentieth century popular science ( e.g . repeated statements by albert einstein ) . einstein , albert , letter to michele besso 's family . ref . bernstein , jeremy . , a critic at large : besso . the new yorker ( 1989 ) . likewise , the idea of determinism was prevalent in twentieth century philosophy and tralfamadorian passivity can be traced back to the stoics . . allusions and references . allusions to other works . as in other novels by vonnegut , fictional crossover , making cameo appearances and connecting the discrete novels to a greater opus . fictional novelist kilgore trout , often an important character in other vonnegut novels , is a social commentator and a friend to billy pilgrim in slaughterhouse-five . in one case , he is the only non-optometrist at a party ; therefore , he is the odd man out . he ridicules everything the ideal american family holds true , such as heaven , hell , and sin . in trout 's opinion , people do not know if the things they do turn out to be good or bad , and if they turn out to be bad , they go to hell , where '' the burning never stops hurting . '' other crossover characters are eliot rosewater , from god bless you , mr . rosewater ; howard w . campbell jr . , from mother night ; and bertram copeland rumfoord , relative of winston niles rumfoord , from the sirens of titan . while vonnegut re-uses characters , the characters are frequently rebooted and do not necessarily maintain the same biographical details from appearance to appearance . kilgore trout in particular is palpably a different person ( although with distinct , consistent character traits ) in each of his appearances in vonnegut 's work . mr . rosewater says that fyodor dostoyevsky 's novel the brothers karamazov contains '' everything there was to know about life . '' vonnegut refers to the marriage of heaven and hell when talking about william blake , billy 's hospital mate 's favorite poet . in the twayne 's united states authors series volume on kurt vonnegut , about the protagonist 's name , stanley schatt says : by naming the unheroic hero billy pilgrim , vonnegut contrasts john bunyan 's '' pilgrim 's progress '' with billy 's story . as wilfrid sheed has pointed out , billy 's solution to the problems of the modern world is to '' invent a heaven , out of 20th century materials , where good technology triumphs over bad technology . his scripture is science fiction , man 's last , good fantasy '' . stanley schatt , '' kurt vonnegut , jr . , chapter 4 : vonnegut 's dresden novel : slaughterhouse-five .

'' the u.s . supreme court considered the first amendment implications of the removal of the book , among others , from school library in the case of island trees school district v . pico , and concluded that '' local school boards may not remove books from school library shelves simply because they dislike the ideas contained in those books and seek by their removal to 'prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics , nationalism , religion , or other matters of opinion . ' '' slaughterhouse-five is the sixty-seventh entry to the american library association 's list of the '' most frequently challenged books of 1990–1999 '' and number forty-six on the ala 's '' most frequently challenged books of 2000–2009 '' . slaughterhouse-five continues to be controversial . in august 2011 , the novel was banned at the republic high school in missouri . the kurt vonnegut memorial library countered by offering 150 free copies of the novel to republic high school students on a first-come , first-served basis . . criticism . critics have accused slaughterhouse-five of being a quietist work , because billy pilgrim believes that the notion of free will is a quaint earthling illusion . robert merrill and peter a . scholl , vonnegut 's slaughterhouse-five : the requirements of chaos , in studies in american fiction , vol . 6 , no . 1 , spring , 1978 , p 67 . the problem , according to robert merrill and peter a . scholl , is that '' vonnegut 's critics seem to think that he is saying the same thing as the tralfamadorians . '' for anthony burgess , '' slaughterhouse is a kind of evasion—in a sense , like j . m . barrie 's peter pan—in which we 're being told to carry the horror of the dresden bombing , and everything it implies , up to a level of fantasy . '' for charles harris , '' the main idea emerging from slaughterhouse-five seems to be that the proper response to life is one of resigned acceptance .
