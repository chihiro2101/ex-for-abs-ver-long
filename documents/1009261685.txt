Convertible

terminology . other terms for convertibles include cabriolet , cabrio , drop top , drophead coupé , open two-seater , open top , rag top , soft top , spider , and spyder . consistency is rare about the current use of cabriolet in preference to convertible . the term cabriolet originated from a carriage cabriolet : '' a light , two-wheeled , one-horse carriage with a folding top , capable of seating two persons '' , however the term is also used to describe other convertibles these days . in the united kingdom , the historical term for a two-door convertible is drophead coupé , and a four-door convertible was called an tourer . nowadays , these names are generally used only for period cars . history . most of the early automobiles were open-air vehicles without any roof or sides . as car engines became more powerful by the end of the 19th century , folding textile or leather roofs ( as had been used on victoria or landau carriages ) began to appear on cars . examples of early cars with roofs include the phaeton ( a two-seat car with a temporary roof ) , the brougham or a coupé de ville ( having an enclosed passenger compartment at the rear , while the driver sat in front either in the open ) or the landaulet ( where the driver has a fixed roof and the passenger compartment has a folding roof ) . less expensive cars , such as the runabouts , sporting roadsters or sturdy touring cars , remained either completely open air or were fitted with a rudimentary folding top and detachable side curtains . in the 1920s , when steel bodies began to be mass-produced , closed cars became available to the average buyer and fully open cars began their disappearance from the mainstream market . by the mid 1930s , the remaining small number of convertibles sold were high priced luxury models . in 1939 , plymouth introduced the first mechanically operated convertible roof . demand for convertibles increased as a result of american soldiers in france and the united kingdom during world war 2 experiencing the small roadster cars which were not available in the united states at the time . these roadsters included the mg t-type and triumph roadster . united states automakers manufactured a broad range of models during the 1950s and 1960s & nbsp ; – from economical compact-sized models such as the rambler american and the studebaker lark , to the more expensive models such as the packard caribbean , oldsmobile 98 , and imperial by chrysler . during the 1970s , popularity of convertibles was severely reduced by the increased travel speeds on roads ( resulting in more wind and noise for occupants ) and proposed vehicle crash safety standards in the united states . automobile air conditioning systems and sunroofs were also becoming popular , reducing the demand for convertibles . after the last cadillac eldorado convertible was made in 1976 , the only convertibles sold in the united states were imported , until chrysler corporation introduced 1982 models based on the k-car . for chrysler this was the lebaron , and for dodge , the 400 . in 1989 , mazda released the first generation mazda mx-5 ( called '' miata '' in north america ) , which has become the best selling convertible with over 1 million cars sold . also in 1989 , toyota released the toyota soarer aerocabin , which uses an electrically operated retractable hardtop roof . only 500 were produced , however the retractable hardtop design has become increasingly popular in the 21st century . currently , models dedicated to the convertible body style include the mazda mx-5 , porsche boxster and opel cascada . many other models also include a convertible body style in the model range . roof types . textile . a '' soft top '' is made from a flexible textile material . common materials for soft tops are : early convertibles used cotton canvas woven so tightly it is waterproof . however , automakers had problems in securing raw materials to fulfill orders after world war ii , including canvas in various shades for convertible tops and limiting their manufacture . a cloth-based material has become more common in recent years . other materials are also used in the convertible top . by 1955 , the most popular materials were latex and butyl rubber fabrics that each accounted for around 35 % of the convertible top weight , with others included vinyl ( 12 % ) , jute ( 8 % ) , and rayon and acrylic fibers ( orlon ) , amounting to about 1 % each in the compositions . polyvinyl chloride ( pvc ) material was used for many convertible tops . the material consists of two layers : a top layer made of pvc , which has a specific structure depending on the vehicle model , and a lower layer made of fabric ( usually cotton ) . the collapsible textile roof section over an articulated folding frame may include linings such as a sound-deadening layer and/or an interior cosmetic lining , to hide the frame . the folded convertible top is called the stack . detachable hardtop . rigid removable hardtops , many of which store in a car 's trunk/boot , have been around at least since the 1950s . these normally provide superior weatherproofing , soundproofing , and durability compared to fabric-based tops , some with integrated rear-window defrosters and windscreens . examples include the ford thunderbird ( 1st-generation and 11th-generation ) , mercedes sl ( 2nd-generation and 3rd-generation ) , porsche boxster , jeep wrangler , ford mustang cobra ( 1995 only ) and mazda mx-5 . during the 1950s and 1960s , detachable hardtops were offered for various convertible sports cars and roadsters , including the 1955–1957 ford thunderbird and chevrolet corvette , as well as the 1963–1971 mercedes-benz w113 series of two-seaters . because the convertible top mechanism is itself expensive , the hardtop was customarily offered as an additional , extra-cost option . on early thunderbirds ( and corvettes through 1967 ) , buyers could choose between a detachable hardtop and a folding canvas top at no additional cost , but paid extra for both . the metal-framed '' carson top '' was a popular addition for the 1930s ford convertibles or roadsters because it turned these models into an almost instant hardtop . the design mimicked a convertible top , but lacking the bulky folding mechanisms enabled the removable hardtop to have a much lower and more rakish profile . improvements in canvas tops have rendered the detachable hardtop less common in recent years , in part because the top can not be stored in the vehicle when not in use , requiring a garage or other storage facility . some open cars continue to offer it as an option . for example , mazda mx-5s has an accessory hardtop , which is compulsory for some auto racing series . retractable hardtop . a retractable hardtop — also known as '' coupé convertible '' or '' coupé cabriolet '' — is a car with an automatically operated , self-storing hardtop ( as opposed to the textile-based roof used by traditional convertibles ) . the benefits of improved climate control and security are traded off against increased mechanical complexity , cost , weight and often reduced luggage capacity . other design features . tonneau cover . folding textile convertible tops often fail to completely hide their internal mechanism or can expose their vulnerable underside to sun exposure and fading . a tonneau cover provides a solution . rear window . rear windows are often part of the roof assembly . traditionally , the rear window in a soft-top was made from plastic ; however , more recently some convertibles have used glass for the rear window . . windblocker . a windblocker or wind deflector minimizes noise and rushing air reaching the occupants . according to the engineer responsible for the 2008 chrysler sebring , its windblocker reduces wind noise by approximately 11 to 12 db . several convertibles are available with a heating duct to the neck area of the seat , which is often called an '' air scarf '' . examples of cars with an air scarf are the mercedes-benz slk-class , mercedes-benz sl-class and audi a5/s5 . safety . modern safety features specifically for convertibles include : roll over protection structure with pyrotechnics roll hoops hidden behind the rear seats that deploy under rollover conditions heated rear window ( for improved visibility ) boron steel-reinforced a-pillars safety cage construction & nbsp ; – a horseshoe-like structure around the passenger compartment & nbsp ; door-mounted side-impact airbag which inflates upward ( instead of downward like the typical curtain airbag ) to provide head protection even with an open window . variations . convertibles have offered numerous iterations that fall between the first mechanically simple but attention-demanding fabric tops to highly complex modern retractable hardtops : roadster : a roadster ( also called spider or spyder ) is an open two-seat car with emphasis on sporting appearance or character . initially an american term for a two-seat car with no weather protection , usage has spread internationally and has evolved to include two-seat convertibles . cabrio coach : a cabrio coach ( also called semi-convertible ) has a retractable textile roof , similar to a traditional convertible . the difference is that a convertible often has the b-pillar , c-pillar and other bodywork removed , however the cabrio-coach retains all bodywork to the top of the door frames and just replaces the roof skin with a retractable fabric panel . an advantage of a cabrio coach is that retaining more of the car 's original structure means that structural rigidity is higher ( or the vehicle weight is lower ) than traditional cabriolets . an example of the cabrio coach is the 2003-10 citroën c3 , which has a roof with five possible configurations . fixed-profile : in contrast to convertibles where the entire bodywork above the beltline ( doors , roof , side pillars , side bodywork ) is replaced with a folding or retractable roof , the fixed profile convertible retain portions of fixed bodywork including the doors , side pillars , and side elements of the roof & mdash ; while a center fabric portion slides back and accordions at the rear . as an example , citroën 's 1948 citroën 2cv featured rigid bodysides and two doors on each side , along with a sunroof that rolled back on itself and extended to the rear bumper in place of a separate trunk lid . other fixed-profile convertibles include the 1957 autobianchi bianchina , 1957 vespa 400 , 1950 nash rambler landau convertible coupe , the nissan figaro ( 1991 ) , the jaguar xj-s ( 1983 ) and the 1957 fiat 500 and its 2007 fiat 500 successor . the 1984 heuliez-designed citroën visa décapotable used elements of a fixed-profile convertible . four-door : most convertibles have two doors , however several four-door convertibles have been produced . examples include the 1934 buick series 60 '' phaeton body '' , : file:1934 buick series 60 convertible phaeton.jpg 1938-39 buick roadmaster , 1940–41 buick super , 1941-1947 oldsmobile 98 1941–47 , 1939 cadillac series 61 , 1940-41 cadillac series 62 and 1961-67 lincoln continental . cars of the sizzling '60s , by the auto editors of consumer guide ( publications international , ltd . , lincolnwood , il , 1997 ) , pages 68 to 69 , and 307 . current production four-door convertibles include the jeep wrangler unlimited . peugeot presented a concept four-door retractable hardtop convertible , the peugeot 407 macarena in 2006 . produced by french coachbuilding specialist heuliez , the macarena 's top can be folded in 60 seconds , with a steel reinforcing beam behind the front seats incorporating lcd screens for the rear passengers into the crossmember . off-road : several off-road vehicles have been produced with removable soft tops . examples include the jeep wrangler , suzuki vitara , suzuki jimny , ford bronco , land rover defender , mercedes-benz g-class and early models of the toyota land cruiser and land rover defender . typically , the soft tops attach to the roll cage or to the installation points on the vehicle 's body . landaulet : a landaulet ( also known as landaulette ) is where the rear passengers are covered by a convertible top . often the driver is separated from the rear passengers with a partition , as per a limousine . in the second half of the 20th century , landaulets were used by public figures ( such as heads of state ) in formal processions . they are now rarely used , for fear of terrorist attack . victoria-cabriolet : reminiscent of the victoria ( carriage ) , a three-position convertible . no rear side windows and equipped with a soft top which can be raised partway , leaving the area above the front seats folded back . this bodystyle had a short period of popularity , mainly in the 1930s but extending into the neighbouring decades . other names include cabriolet/coupé milord ( or just milord ) , calash ( from calèche ) , folding head dhc , three-position drop-head coupé , or cabriolet toit de 3 positions . idabs , p . 35 . gallery . open car and
