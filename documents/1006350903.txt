Film speed

film speed measurement systems . historical systems . . warnerke . the first known practical sensitometry , which allowed measurements of the speed of photographic materials , was invented by the polish engineer leon warnerke – pseudonym of ( 1837–1900 ) – in 1880 , among the achievements for which he was awarded the progress medal of the photographic society of great britain in 1882 . it was commercialized since 1881 . the warnerke standard sensitometer consisted of a frame holding an opaque screen with an array of typically 25 numbered , gradually pigmented squares brought into contact with the photographic plate during a timed test exposure under a phosphorescent tablet excited before by the light of a burning magnesium ribbon . the speed of the emulsion was then expressed in 'degrees ' warnerke ( sometimes seen as warn . or °w . ) corresponding with the last number visible on the exposed plate after development and fixation . each number represented an increase of 1/3 in speed , typical plate speeds were between 10° and 25° warnerke at the time . his system saw some success but proved to be unreliable due to its spectral sensitivity to light , the fading intensity of the light emitted by the phosphorescent tablet after its excitation as well as high built-tolerances . the concept , however , was later built upon in 1900 by henry chapman jones ( 1855–1932 ) plate tester and modified speed system . . hurter '' driffield . another early practical system for measuring the sensitivity of an emulsion was that of hurter and driffield ( h & d ) , originally described in 1890 , by the swiss-born ferdinand hurter ( 1844–1898 ) and british vero charles driffield ( 1848–1915 ) . in their system , speed numbers were inversely proportional to the exposure required . for example , an emulsion rated at 250 h & d would require ten times the exposure of an emulsion rated at 2500 h & d . the methods to determine the sensitivity were later modified in 1925 ( in regard to the light source used ) and in 1928 ( regarding light source , developer and proportional factor ) —this later variant was sometimes called '' h & d 10 '' . the h & d system was officially accepted as a standard in the former soviet union from 1928 until september 1951 , when it was superseded by gost 2817–50 . scheiner . the scheinergrade ( sch . ) system was devised by the german astronomer julius scheiner ( 1858–1913 ) in 1894 originally as a method of comparing the speeds of plates used for astronomical photography . scheiner 's system rated the speed of a plate by the least exposure to produce a visible darkening upon development . speed was expressed in degrees scheiner , originally ranging from 1° sch . to 20° sch . , where an increment of 19° sch . corresponded to a hundredfold increase in sensitivity , which meant that an increment of 3° sch . came close to a doubling of sensitivity . : \sqrt19 . further reading . iso 6:1974 , iso 6:1993 ( 1993-02 ) .
