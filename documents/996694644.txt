Heinrich Ewald

life . ewald was born at göttingen where his father was a linen weaver . in 1815 he was sent to the gymnasium , and in 1820 he entered the university of göttingen , where he studied with j.g . eichhorn and t . c . tychsen , specialising in oriental languages . at the close of his academic studies in 1823 he was appointed to a mastership in the gymnasium at wolfenbüttel , and made a study of the oriental manuscripts in the wolfenbüttel library . but in the spring of 1824 he was recalled to göttingen as theological tutor , and in 1827 ( the year of eichhorn 's death ) he became professor extraordinarius in philosophy and lecturer in old testament exegesis . heinrich ewald married in 1830 wilhelmina ( 1808–1846 ) , daughter of c.f . gauss . of all of gauss ' children , wilhelmina was said to have come closest to her father 's talent , but she died young . in 1831 heinrich ewald was promoted to professor ordinarius in philosophy ; in 1833 he became a member of the royal scientific society , and in 1835 , after tychsen 's death , he entered the faculty of theology , taking the chair of oriental languages . two years later occurred the first important episode in ewald 's studious life . in 1837 , on 18 november , along with göttingen seven he signed a formal protest against the action of king ernst august in abolishing the liberal constitution of 1833 , which had been granted to the house of hanover by his predecessor william iv . this procedure of the seven professors led to their expulsion from the university ( 14 december ) . early in 1838 ewald received a call to tübingen , and there for upwards of ten years he held a chair as professor ordinarius , first in philosophy and afterwards , from 1841 , in theology . to this period belong some of his most important works , and also the commencement of his bitter feud with f.c . baur and the tübingen school . in 1847 , '' the great shipwreck-year in germany , '' as he has called it , he was invited back to göttingen on honourable terms—the liberal constitution having been restored . he accepted the invitation . in 1862-1863 ewald took an active part in a movement for reform within the hanoverian church , and he was a member of the synod which passed the new constitution . he had an important share also in the formation of the protestantenverein , or protestant association , in september 1863 . but the chief crisis in his life arose out of the austro-prussian war of 1866 . his loyalty to king george v of hanover ( son of ernst august ) would not permit him to take the oath of allegiance to the victorious king william i of prussia , and he was therefore placed on the retired list , though with the full amount of his salary as pension . this degree of severity might have been held by the prussian authorities to be unnecessary , had ewald been less hostile in his language . the violent tone of some of his printed manifestoes about this time , especially of his lob des königs u . des volkes , led to his being deprived of the venia legendi ( 1868 ) and also to a criminal trial , which , however , resulted in his acquittal ( may 1869 ) . then , and on two subsequent occasions , he was returned by the city of hanover as a member of the north german and german parliaments . in june 1874 he was found guilty of a libel on otto von bismarck , whom he had compared to frederick the great in '' his unrighteous war with austria and his ruination of religion and morality , '' to napoleon iii in his way of '' picking out the best time possible for robbery and plunder . '' for this offence he was sentenced to undergo three weeks ' imprisonment . he died in göttingen in his 72nd year , of heart disease . . influence . in his public life ewald displayed characteristics such as simplicity and sincerity , moral earnestness , independence , absolute fearlessness . as a teacher he had a remarkable power of kindling enthusiasm ; and he taught many distinguished pupils , including august schleicher , ferdinand hitzig , eberhard schrader , theodor noldeke , diestel and christian friedrich august dillmann . his disciples were not all of one school , but many eminent scholars who apparently have been untouched by his influence have in fact developed some of the many ideas which he suggested . ewald 's hebrew grammar inaugurated a new era in biblical philology . subsequent works in that department were avowedly based on his , and hitzig referred to him as '' the second founder of the science of the hebrew language . '' he made important contributions as an exegete , biblical critic and grammarian . in particular , his geschichte des volkes israel , the result of thirty years ' labour , was important in that branch of research . taking up the idea of a divine education of the human race , and firmly believing that providence assigned a special task to each of the leading nations of antiquity , ewald felt no difficulty about israel 's place in universal history , or about the problem which that race had been called upon to solve . the history of israel , according to him , was the history how humanity acquired one true religion , beginning with the exodus and culminating in the appearing of jesus . the historical interval that separated these two events is treated as naturally dividing itself into three great periods—those of moses , david and ezra . the periods are externally indicated by the successive names by which the chosen people were called—hebrews , israelites , jews . the events prior to the exodus are relegated by ewald to a preliminary chapter of primitive history ; and the events of the apostolic and post-apostolic age are treated as a kind of appendix . the entire construction of the history is based on a critical examination and chronological arrangement of the available documents . . works . thumb the more important of ewald 's works are : die composition der genesis kritisch untersucht ( 1823 ) , an attempt to account for the use of the two names of god without recourse to the documentary hypothesis ; he was not himself , however , permanently convinced by it . de metris carminum arabicorum ( 1825 ) des hohelied salomons übersetzt und erklärt ( 1826 ; 3rd ed , 1866 ) über einige ältere sanskritmetra ( 1827 ) kritische grammatik der hebräischen sprache ( leipzig 1827 ) , was abridged and published under a new title : grammatik der hebräischen sprache ( leipzig 1828 ) ; 2nd ed . of the abridged version ( leipzig 1835 ) english translation of the 1835 ed . by john nicholson : a grammar of the hebrew language of the old testament ( london 1836 ) ; 3rd ed .
