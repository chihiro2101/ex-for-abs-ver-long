( in fact , the illustration included with the story features the actual stage used for kukla , fran and ollie . ) at the end of the show , '' millions watching felt a sense of loss as though a family close to them were breaking up . '' milly has been with the show two years , and , as in other versions of the story , she interacts in a spontaneous and endearing way directly with the personae of the puppets . in a flashback , during her audition , she had met and talked to the puppets before meeting any human being . not realizing that this encounter was her audition , she is surprised when a station representative meets her and tells her '' your performance this afternoon came closest to what mr villeridge wants . '' she says '' but it actually was n't a performance '' , and is told '' exactly . the first time you start giving a performance , you 're through . '' villeridge , we learn , is french canadian , and had once been headed for a serious career as a hockey player . in an accident , two men '' skated over the side of his face , '' ending his hockey career , and seriously and permanently disfiguring him . she soon learns that villeridge is emotionally an abuser . she loves the on-air performances , loves the puppets and their personalities , and finds mr tootenheimer , the wise old toymaker , particularly comforting , but she hates villeridge and what he does to her in rehearsal and after the show . he shouts at her , demeans her , criticizes everything she has done , and humiliates her in front of the program staff . when she meets a nice man named fred archer and believes she is '' a little in love '' with him , she decides she can no longer stand villeridge and his tyrannical ways . she announces that she is marrying archer and gives notice . after her farewell show , she changes into her street dress . she waits for everyone else to leave the studio , afraid of encountering villeridge , who '' might be waiting for her with one last attack . '' as she leaves , she hears the voice of arthur , the puppet , who says , '' i stayed behind . milly , take me with you . '' soon she is talking to arthur and the other puppets . mr tootenheimer , the '' old philosopher '' , explains to her that every man is composed of many things , and that the puppets represent aspects of villeridge 's real personality : : and if a man who has been cut and scarred and is ashamed of his appearance , who loved you from the first time his eyes rested upon your face , could be a brutal fool , believing that if you could be made to love all of the things he really was , you would never again recoil from the things he seemed to be . millie cries '' crake ! crake ! come to me . '' they embrace , and milly decides to say goodbye to '' the outside world & mdash ; reality & mdash ; fred archer '' and live with villeridge and his created '' never-never land of the mind . '' . love of seven dolls . '' in paris in the spring of our times , a young girl was about to throw herself into the seine . '' thus opens the novella from which the film lili and the musical carnival was drawn . the paul gallico short story from which lili was adapted was published in expanded form in 1954 as love of seven dolls , a 125-page novella . the new york times review of the book opens '' those audiences still making their way to see lili may now read the book from which this motion picture was adapted . '' the original short story was clearly based on the popular television puppet show kukla , fran and ollie , as it takes place in a television studio ( not a carnival as in the film and book ) , and has many characters based on the kuklapolitans . the novella was far more mystical and magic than the short story . brettonais from the village of plouha . '' wretched though she was , some of the mystery of that mysterious land still clung to her.the gravity of her glance , the innocence and primitive mind.there were dark corners of celtic brooding.a little scarecrow . '' helen deutsch 's adaptation is somewhat true to the essential core of gallico 's story , but there are many differences , and gallico 's book is far , far darker in tone . in the book , the girl 's nickname is mouche ( '' fly '' ) rather than lili . the puppeteer is named michel peyrot , stage name capitaine coq , rather than paul berthalet . he is not a crippled dancer ; rather , '' he was bred out of the gutters of paris '' , yet something moves him to save the potential suicide . the puppeteer 's assistant is a '' primitive '' senegalese man named golo , rather than the movie 's amiable frenchman , jacquot . he shares with mouche a sense of primitive magic , and with her believes in the reality of the puppets . the first four puppets she meets correspond closely to those in the film and are a youth named carrot top ; a fox , reynardo ; a vain girl , gigi ; and a '' huge , tousle-headed , hideous , yet pathetic-looking giant '' alifanfaron . the latter two are named '' marguerite '' and '' golo '' in the movie ( i.e . the name of the puppeteer 's assistant in the book becomes the name of a puppet in the movie ) . the book includes three additional puppets : a penguin named dr . duclos who wears a pince-nez and is a dignified academic ; madame muscat , '' the concierge '' , who constantly warns mouche that the others are '' a bad lot '' ; and monsieur nicholas , a man with steel-rimmed spectacles , stocking cap , and leather apron , who is '' a maker and mender of toys . '' the core of both book and movie is the childlike innocence of mouche/lili and her simple conviction that she is interacting directly with the puppets themselves , which have some kind of existence separate from the puppeteer . this separation is perfectly explicit in the book . it says that golo was '' childlike.but in the primitive fashion backed by the dark lore of his race '' and looked upon the puppets '' as living , breathing creatures '' , but '' the belief in the separate existence of these little people was even more basic with mouche for it was a necessity to her and a refuge from the storms of life with which she had been unable to cope . '' in the movie , the puppeteer , paul berthalet , is gruff , unhappy , and emotionally distant . although lili refers to him as '' the angry man '' , he is not very cruel or menacing . his bitterness is explained by his identity as a former ballet dancer , disabled by a leg injury and '' reduced '' to the role of puppeteer . gallico 's peyrot , however , is vicious in every sense of the word . no ballet dancer , he was '' bred out of the gutters '' and by the age of 15 was '' a little savage practiced in all the cruel arts and swindles of the street fairs and cheap carnivals . '' he has '' the look of a satyr . '' '' throughout his life no one had ever been kind to him , or gentle , and he paid back the world in like . wholly cynical , he had no regard for man , woman , child , or god . he would , if he could , have corrupted the whole world . '' in both book and movie , mouche/lili is tempted by a superficial attraction to a handsome man & mdash ; an acrobat named balotte in the book , the magician marc in the movie & mdash ; but returns to the puppeteer . in the movie , marc 's relation with lili is exploitative . in the book , however , peyrot is the exploitative and abusive one , and the relationship with balottmouche '' passed in that moment over the last threshold from child to womanhood '' and knew '' the catalyst that could save him . it was herself . '' she tells peyrot '' michel.i love you . i will never leave you . '' peyrot does not respond , but he weeps ; mouche holds his '' transfigured '' head and , according to gallico , '' knew that they were the tears of a man.who , emerging from the long nightmare , would be made forever whole by love . '' if this is a happy ending , it is not the simple happy ending of the movie . reviewing the book on its publication , andrea parke says that gallico creates '' magic.when he writes the sequences with mouche and the puppets . '' but '' when he writes the love story of mouche as the ill-treated plaything of the puppet master , the story loses its magic . the mawkish realism of the passages has an aura of bathos that is not only unreal but unmoving .
