Terrytoons

history . before terrytoons . thumb terry first worked for bray studios in 1916 , where he created the farmer al falfa series . he would then make a farmer al falfa short for edison studios , called '' farmer al falfa 's wayward pup '' ( 1917 ) , and some later cartoons were made for paramount pictures . around 1921 , terry founded the fables animation studio , named for its aesop 's film fables series , in conjunction with the studio of amedee j . van beuren . fables churned out a fable cartoon every week for eight years in the 1920s . in 1928 , van beuren , anxious to compete with the new phenomenon of talking pictures , released terry 's dinner time ( released october 1928 ) . van beuren then urged terry to start producing actual sound films , instead of post-synchronizing the cartoons . terry refused , and van beuren fired him in 1929 . almost immediately , terry and much of his staff started up the terrytoons studio near his former studio . one staff member during that time was art babbitt , who went on to become a well known disney animator . peak era . through much of its history , the studio was considered one of the lowest-quality houses in the field , to the point where paul terry noted , '' let walt disney be the tiffany 's of the business . i want to be the woolworth 's ! '' terry 's studio had the lowest budgets , and was among the slowest to adapt to new technologies such as sound ( in about 1930 ) and technicolor ( in 1938 ) . while its graphic style remained remarkably static for decades , it actually followed the sound cartoon trend of the late 1920s and early 1930s very quickly . background music was entrusted to one man , philip scheib , and terry 's refusal to pay royalties for popular songs forced scheib to compose his own scores . paul terry took pride in producing a new cartoon every other week , regardless of the quality of the films . following the success of disney 's snow white and the seven dwarfs ( 1937 ) paul terry considered making an animated feature film adaptation of king lear starring farmer al falfa . however , after seeing the commercial failures of disney 's pinocchio and fantasia ( both 1940 ) and max fleischer 's mr . bug goes to town ( 1941 ) , he decided to abandon the project . until 1957 , screen credits were very sparse , listing only the writer ( until 1950 , solely john foster ; then tom morrison thereafter ) , director ( terry 's three main directors were connie rasinski , eddie donnelly , and mannie davis ) , and musician ( musical director philip a . scheib ) . terrytoons ' first distributor was educational pictures , specialists in short-subject comedies and novelties . audio-cinema in the early 1930s backed the production of terrytoons , and distributed the educational library internationally , except in the united kingdom and ireland where the library was distributed by educational and gaumont-british in partnership with the ideal film company . the fox film company ( from 1935 , 20th century fox ) then released educational shorts to theaters in the 1930s , giving the terry cartoons wide exposure . after 20th century-fox withdrew its support from educational pictures , the company both backed and distributed terrytoons . farmer al falfa was terry 's most familiar character in the 1930s ; kiko the kangaroo was spun off the farmer al falfa series . most of the other cartoons featured generic animal characters . one of the stock designs was a scruffy dog with a black patch around one eye ; terry ultimately built a series around this character , now known as puddy the pup . paul terry may have realized that educational was in financial trouble , because he found another lucrative outlet for his product . in 1938 , he arranged to release his older cartoons through home-movie distributor castle films . educational went out of business within the year , but 20th century-fox continued to release terrytoons to theaters for the next two decades . with a new emphasis on '' star '' characters , terrytoons featured the adventures of super mouse ( later renamed mighty mouse ) , the talking magpies heckle and jeckle , silly gandy goose , dinky duck , mischievous mouse little roquefort , and the terry bears . despite the artistic drawbacks imposed by terry 's inflexible business policies , terrytoons was nominated four times for the academy award for animated short film : all out for v in 1942 , my boy , johnny in 1944 , mighty mouse in gypsy life in 1945 , and sidney 's family tree in 1958 . changing hands . the studio was sold outright by the retiring paul terry to cbs in 1956 , but 20th century fox ( tcf ) continued to distribute the studio 's releases . it became a division of the cbs films subsidiary . the following year , cbs put it under the management of upa alumnus gene deitch , who had to work with even lower budgets . deitch 's most notable works at the studio were the tom terrific cartoon segments for the captain kangaroo television show . he also introduced a number of new characters , such as sidney the elephant , sidney the elephant at don markstein 's toonopedia . archived from the original on january 20 , 2015 . gaston le crayon , gaston le crayon at don markstein 's toonopedia . archived from the original on april 16 , 2012 . john doormat , and clint clobber . clint clobber at don markstein 's toonopedia . archived from the original on april 16 , 2012 . before deitch was fired in 1959 , bill weiss took complete control of the studio . under his supervision , heckle and jeckle and mighty mouse went back into production . besides the three core directors of the terry era who were still involved as animators and directors , two famous studios stalwarts joined the crew , dave tendlar and martin taras . other new theatrical cartoon series included hector heathcote , luno and hashimoto san . in addition , the studio began producing the deputy dawg series for television in 1959 . another television production for the captain kangaroo show was the adventures of lariat sam , which was written in part by gene wood , who would later become the announcer for several tv game shows including family feud . phil scheib continued as the studio 's musical director through the mid-1960s when he was replaced by jim timmens and elliott lawrence . the best-known talent at terrytoons in the 1960s was animator/director/producer ralph bakshi , who started with terrytoons in the 1950s as an opaquer , and eventually helmed the mighty heroes series . bakshi left terrytoons in 1967 for paramount , which closed its cartoon unit later that year . he would later go on to produce mighty mouse : the new adventures for television in 1987 . post-history . after the departure of bakshi , the studio petered out , and finally closed in 1972 . as a result of the fcc banning tv networks from owning cable television and syndication of television programs , cbs created viacom international to handle all network programs beyond tv production and network broadcasting . on july 4 , 1971 , viacom international spun off from cbs ; neither viacom international nor cbs had any interest in terrytoons . the terrytoons film library was still regularly re-released to theaters by fox . the studio 's last short was an unsold tv pilot called sally sargent , about a 16-year-old girl who is a secret agent . soon after sally sargent was completed , viacom international ended their relationship with fox and re-releases ceased . terrytoons ’ existence soon came to an end . art bartsch , who kept the studio running after bakshi left , would soon die along with connie rasinski , and bob kuwahara , reducing the studio to a ghost studio with executive producer bill weiss and story supervisor tom morrison ; viacom kept the studio open until 1972 . by october 1972 , viacom international announced that terrytoons will leave new rochelle and relocate to viacom international 's office in new york city . by december 29 , viacom sold the now abandoned new rochelle studio , and the company 's fate was forever sealed . bill weiss continued terrytoons production from his new york city office with the 1970s terrytoons cartoons ( especially mighty mouse and deputy dawg ) being syndicated to many local tv markets , and they were a staple of after-school and saturday-morning cartoon shows for over three decades , from the 1950s through the 1980s , until the television rights to the library were acquired by usa network in 1989 . however , any new cartoons of the studio 's stars came from other studios . in the late 1970s , filmation licensed the rights in order to make a new mighty mouse series from viacom international . in 1987 , ralph bakshi produced mighty mouse : the new adventures , which lasted for two seasons . bakshi and john kricfalusi inspired the staff to try to get as much jim tyer-style drawing in the show as possible . tyer , a stand-out terry animator of the original cartoons with a unique style , became a strong influence on the artists of the bakshi series . in 1999 , nickelodeon attempted to revive the terrytoons characters as part of a tv series called curbside . curbside would have been a parody of late-night talk shows with heckle and jeckle serving as hosts of the show , along with their assistant dinky duck , and would have featured new cartoons featuring terrytoon characters like deputy dawg , sidney the elephant , and mighty mouse . however , it was never picked up , making it the only terrytoons show that was never officially released . in 2002 , the terrytoons characters returned to television in original commercials for brazilian blue cheese ( for what is now america 's dairy farmers ) and a fine wine . through the years that have followed since the last terrytoons tv series material in 1988 , the rights have been scattered as result of prior rights issues and the corporate changes involving viacom and cbs . since cbs corporation re-merged with viacom to form viacomcbs , reuniting cbs with paramount , on december 4 , 2019 , paramount pictures now owns the theatrical distribution on behalf of paramount animation and cbs entertainment group , while cbs television distribution owns the television distribution to the terrytoons film library . however , some terrytoons shorts are believed to be in the public domain , and have been issued on low-budget vhs tapes and dvds . on january 5 , 2010 , the first official release of any terrytoons material by cbs dvd was issued in the form of the complete series of mighty mouse : the new adventures . terrytoons comic books . thumb among the many licensed terrytoons products are comic books , mainly published throughout the 1940s and 1950s . the company 's characters — including mighty mouse , the magpies heckle and jeckle , dinky duck , gandy goose , and little roquefort — were initially licensed to timely , a predecessor of marvel comics , in 1942 . st . john publications took over the license from 1947 to 1956 , pines comics published terrytoons comics from 1956 to 1959 , dell comics made an attempt from 1959 to 1962 ( and again later from 1966 to 1967 ) , and finally western publishing published mighty mouse comics from 1962 all the way up to 1980 . the lead title , terry-toons comics , was published by timely from oct . 1942–aug . 1947 .
