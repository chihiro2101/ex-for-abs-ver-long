life . bagehot was born in langport , somerset , england , on 3 february 1826 . his father , thomas watson bagehot , was managing director and vice-chairman of stuckey 's bank . he attended university college london ( ucl ) , where he studied mathematics , and in 1848 earned a master 's degree in moral philosophy . richard holt hutton ( 1915 ) . '' memoirs . '' in : the works and life of walter bagehot , vol . 1 . london : longmans , green , and co . , pp . 1–54 . bagehot was call to the bar by lincoln 's inn , but preferred to join his father in 1852 in his family 's shipping and banking business . in 1858 , bagehot married elizabeth ( eliza ) wilson ( 1832–1921 ) , whose father , james wilson , was the founder and owner of the economist ; the couple were happily married until bagehot 's untimely death at age 51 , but had no children . a collection of their love-letters was published in 1933 . . journalism . in 1855 , bagehot founded the national review with his friend richard holt hutton . walter bagehot by st . norman john-stevas the british council/national book league/longmans , greene & co . london . ( 1963 ) in 1861 , he became editor-in-chief of the economist . in the 17 years he served as its editor , bagehot expanded the economists reporting on politics and increased its influence among policymakers . he was widely accepted by the british establishment and was elected to the athenaeum in 1875 . works . in 1867 , bagehot wrote the english constitution , a book that explores the nature of the constitution of the united kingdom , specifically its parliament and monarchy . it appeared at the same time that parliament enacted the reform act of 1867 , requiring bagehot to write an extended introduction to the second edition which appeared in 1872 . bagehot also wrote physics and politics ( 1872 ) , in which he examines how civilisations sustain themselves , arguing that in their earliest phase civilisations are very much in opposition to the values of modern liberalism , insofar as they are sustained by conformism and military success , but once they are secured it is possible for them to mature into systems which allow for greater diversity and freedom . his viewpoint was based on a distinction between the qualities of an “ accomplished man ” and those of a “ rude man ” , which he considered the result of iterative inheritances by which the “ nervous organisation ” of the individual became increasingly refined through the generations . he regarded this distinction as a moral achievement whereby through the actions of the will , this “ accomplished “ elite was able to morally differentiate themselves from “ rude men “ by a “ hereditary drill “ . he equally applied such reasoning to develop a form of pseudoscience racism , whereby those of mixed race lacked any “ inherited creed ” or “ fixed traditional sentiments ” upon which , he considered , human nature depended . he attempted to provide empirical support for his views by citing john lubbock and edward tylor , although neither of them accepted such arguments for hereditary difference in their writings on human evolution . tylor in particular rejected bagehot 's view of the centrality of physical heredity and that the modern “ savage “ mind was “ tattooed over with monstrous images ” by which base instincts had been preserved in crevices , as opposed to the accomplished european man , for whom such instincts had been smoothed away through inherited will to exercise reason . in lombard street : a description of the money market ( 1873 ) bagehot seeks to explain the world of finance and banking . '' bagehot and international lending '' . by professor m . lipton . the financial times ( london , england ) , tuesday , june 12 , 1984 ; p . 17 ; edition 29,344 . his observations on finance are often cited by central bankers , most recently in the wake of the global financial crisis which began in 2007 . of particular importance is '' bagehot 's dictum '' that in times of financial crisis central banks should lend freely to solvent depository institutions , yet only against sound collateral and at interest rates high enough to dissuade those borrowers that are not genuinely in need . paul tucker , deputy governor , financial stability , bank of england , '' the repertoire of official sector interventions in the financial system : last resort lending , market-making , and capital '' , bank of japan 2009 international conference , 27–28 may 2009 , p . 5 . legacy . bagehot never fully recovered from a bout of pneumonia he suffered in 1867 , and he died in 1877 from complications of what was said to be a cold . roger kimball , '' the greatest victorian '' , the new criterion october 1998 . collections of bagehot 's literary , political , and economic essays were published after his death . their subjects ranged from shakespeare and disraeli to the price of silver . in honour of his contributions , the economists weekly commentary on current affairs in the uk is entitled '' bagehot '' . every year , the british political studies association awards the walter bagehot prize for the best dissertation in the field of government and public administration . minor planet 2901 bagehot discovered by luboš kohoutek is named in his honor . . major publications .
