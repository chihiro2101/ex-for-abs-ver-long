Ceremonial mace

history . ancient near east . ceremonial maces originated in the ancient near east , where they were used as symbols of rank and authority across the region during the late stone age , bronze age , and early iron age . among the oldest known ceremonial maceheads are the ancient egypt scorpion macehead and narmer macehead ; both are elaborately engraved with royal scenes , although their precise role and symbolism is obscure . in later mesopotamian art , the mace is more clearly associated with authority ; by the old babylonian period the most common figure on cylinder seals ( a type of seal used to authenticate clay documents ) is a repeated type now known as '' the figure with mace '' who wears a royal hat , holds a mace in his left hand , and is thought to represent a generic king . ceremonial maces are also prominently depicted in the royal art of ancient assyria , such as the stela of ashurnasirpal ii and the stela of shamshi-adad v , in which the assyrian kings are shown performing rites or making religious gestures while holding a mace to symbolise their authority . . eastern roman empire . some officials of the medieval eastern roman empire carried maces for either practical or ceremonial purposes . notable among the latter is the allagion , a military-judicial position that existed by about the 10th century a.d . and whose symbols of office were reported by the palaiologan writer pseudo-kodinos in the 14th century to include a silver-gilt mace ( matzouka ) . at this time the duties of the protoallagator included commanding the emperor 's personal allagion , his military retinue . the ceremonial function of the mace may have passed to the late roman empire from the ancient near east by way of persia , and from there to other european cultures . . medieval and renaissance europe . the earliest ceremonial maces in france and england were practical weapons intended to protect the king 's person , borne by the sergeant-at-arms , a royal bodyguard established in france by philip ii , and in england probably by richard i , ( c . 1180 ) . by the 14th century , these sergeants ' maces had started to become increasingly decorative , encased in precious metals . as a weapon , the mace fell out of use with the disappearance of heavy armour . the history of the civic mace ( carried by the sergeants-at-arms ) begins around the middle of the 13th century , though no examples from that period remain today . the oldest civic mace in england ( still remaining today ) is that of hedon . it was granted ( along with an important charter ) in 1415 . at the time , ornamented civic maces were considered an infringement of one of the privileges of the king 's sergeants , who alone deserved to bear maces enriched with costly metals , according to a house of commons petition of 1344 . however , the sergeants of london later gained this privilege , as did later those of york ( 1396 ) , norwich ( 1403–1404 ) , and chester ( 1506 ) . records exist of maces covered with silver in use at exeter in 1387–1388 ; norwich bought two in 1435 , and launceston others in 1467 and 1468 . several other cities and towns subsequently acquired silver maces , and the 16th century saw almost universal use . early in the 15th century , the flanged end of the mace ( the head of the war mace ) was carried uppermost , with the small button bearing the royal arms in the base . by the beginning of the tudor period , however , the blade-like flanges , originally made for offence , degenerated into mere ornaments , while the increased importance of the end with the royal arms ( afterwards enriched with a cresting ) resulted in the reversal of the position . the custom of carrying the flanged end upward did not die out at once : a few maces , such as the winchcombe silver maces , which date from the end of the 15th century , were made to be carried both ways . the guildford mace provides one of the finest of the fifteen specimens of the 15th century . craftsmen often pierced and decorated the flanged ends of the maces of this period beautifully . these flanges gradually became smaller , and by the 16th or early 17th century had developed into pretty projecting scroll-brackets and other ornaments , which remained in vogue until about 1640 . the next development in the embellishment of the shaft was the reappearance of these small scroll-brackets on the top , immediately under the head of the mace . they disappear altogether from the foot in the last half of the 17th century , and remain only under the heads , or , in rarer instances , on a knob on the shaft . the silver mace-heads were mostly plain , with a cresting of leaves or flowers in the 15th and 16th centuries . in the reign of james i of england they began to be engraved and decorated with heraldic devices and similar ornamentation . as the custom of having sergeants ' maces began to die out about 1650 , the large maces borne before the mayor or bailiffs came into general use . thomas maundy functioned as the chief maker of maces during the english commonwealth . he made the mace for the house of commons in 1649 . this mace is still in use today , though without the original head . the original head , which was not engraved with regal symbols , was replaced by one with regal symbols at the time of the restoration of the monarchy . oliver cromwell referred to the house of commons mace as '' a marotte '' when he dissolved the rump parliament in 1653 . australia . the ceremonial maces of the australian house of representatives and the australian senate symbolise both the authority of each chamber and the royal authority of australia 's monarch . senate . the ceremonial mace of the senate of australia is the black rod . the ceremonial custodian of the black rod is the usher of the black rod . . house of representatives . the sergeant-at-arms of the australian house of representatives is the ceremonial custodian of the mace of the house . at the beginning and end of every day the house sits , the speaker of the house enters and leaves the house preceded by the sergeant-at-arms carrying the mace on his or her right shoulder . the current mace is made of gilded silver , and was a gift to the house from king george vi on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of federation in 1951 . it was presented to the house by a delegation of members of the british house of commons . in may 1914 , labor mp william higgs played a practical joke on the house by hiding the mace under one of the opposition frontbenches . it was not found for two hours , and police were called in as it was assumed to have been stolen . after initially denying his role in the incident , higgs apologised to his colleagues the following week , stating he had acted in '' a spirit of frivolity '' . his admission that he was '' entirely to blame '' was met with cheers . . queensland parliament . a silver-gilt mace was produced for the queensland parliament in 1978 by marples and beasley of birmingham , united kingdom . it is long and weighs . the mace is inlaid with 15 sapphires , 9 opals , 6 amethysts and 2 garnets , all originating from the state of queensland . . bahamas . the ceremonial maces in the bahamas symbolise both the authority of each chamber and the royal authority of elizabeth ii , monarchy of the bahamas . on 27 april 1965 , a day known in the bahamas as '' black tuesday '' , lynden pindling , then opposition leader , threw the 165-year-old speaker 's mace out of a house of assembly window to protest against the unfair gerrymandering of constituency boundaries by the then ruling united bahamian party ( ubp ) government . the speaker tried to restore order but he was reminded by labour leader randol fawkes that the business of the house could not legally continue without the mace . the badly damaged mace was recovered by the police and returned to the house . the house of assembly reconvened with a temporary wooden mace loaned by canada ; this was the same temporary mace used by the house of commons of canada after it lost its own mace to a fire in 1916 . the temporary mace ultimately returned to canada freshly gilded . in november 1975 , the house of commons of the united kingdom donated a new mace to the house of assembly . on 3 december 2001 , cassius stuart and omar smith , leader and deputy leader of the bahamas democratic movement , a minor political party , charged from the public gallery onto the floor of the house of assembly and handcuffed themselves to the mace in protest against '' unfair gerrymandering '' of constituency boundaries by the free national movement ( fnm ) government . the mace was unable to be separated from the men and the sitting of the house had to be suspended . the pair were jailed for almost two days but no charges were brought against them . canada . the ceremonial maces in the canadian senate and house of commons embody the authority each chamber derives from monarchy of canada . the current mace in the commons is the fourth mace , a replica of the third one destroyed by fire at the centre block in 1916 . a similar practice is employed in each of the provincial and territorial legislatures , with a mace representing the sovereign 's authority and power in each of the respective legislatures . protocol surrounding the mace . in canada , each of the legislatures follow a relatively standard protocol in relation to the ceremonial mace ; the speaker ( politics ) normally enters following a mace-bearer ( normally the sergeant-at-arms ) , who subsequently sets the mace on the clerks ' table to begin the sitting . when the sergeant-at-arms removes the mace from the table , the house has either adjourned , recessed , or been resolved into a committee of the whole . before the reigning monarch or one of his or her representatives ( the governor general or one of the lieutenant governors ) may enter a legislative chamber , the mace must be completely hidden from view . this is done by draping the mace in a heavy velvet cloth , a procedure performed by the house pages . during the election of the speaker , the mace is removed from the table to show that the house is not fully constituted until the new speaker takes the chair and the mace is laid on the table . history of the maces . the oldest documented use of a ceremonial mace in a legislature of a british north american colony was at the 1st general assembly of nova scotia , which convened in 1758 . the first mace was used by the chamber of upper canada 's first parliament in 1792 at newark ( now niagara-on-the-lake ) and then moved to york ( now toronto ) . this first mace was a primitive wooden implement , painted red and gilt and surmounted by a crown of thin brass strips . it was stolen by american troops as a prize of war during the battle of york of the war of 1812 in 1813 . the mace was stored at united states naval academy at annapolis , maryland and remained in the united states until 1934 when it was returned to ontario when president franklin roosevelt sent an order to congress to return the mace . it was stored at the royal ontario museum for a time , and is now located in the main lobby of the ontario legislative building . a second mace was introduced in 1813 and used until 1841 . the third mace was not purchased until 1845 . in 1849 , when the parliament for the united province of canada was sitting in montreal , it was stolen by a riotous mob , apparently intent upon destroying it in a public demonstration . it was rescued and returned to the speaker , sir allan macnab , the next day . later , in 1854 , the mace was twice rescued when the parliament buildings in quebec were ravaged by fire . the mace continued to be used by the union parliament in toronto , quebec city and ottawa until confederation in 1867 . the new house of commons of canada then adopted the mace , where it remained until 1916 . the mace of the house of commons was destroyed when the centre_block great_fire in 1916 ; all that remained was a fist-sized ball of silver and gold . in the immediate aftermath , the house of commons used the surviving senate mace , then the mace of the ontario provincial legislature for three weeks , after which a wooden mace was crafted and used . in june 1916 , the city of london donated a new mace made with the remains of the one destroyed ; this mace continues to serve . being a symbol of the power and authority of a legislative assembly , a precedent was set in 2002 as to the severity of acts of disrespect toward the mace in canada and , by proxy , the monarch . after keith martin , federal member of parliament for esquimalt—juan de fuca , seized the ceremonial mace of the house of commons from the clerk 's table on april 17 , 2002 , the speaker of that chamber ruled that a prima facie breach of the privileges of the house had occurred , and contempt of the house been committed . martin was not permitted to resume his seat until he had issued a formal apology from the bar of the house , pursuant to a motion passed in response to the incident . parliament of ontario . the ceremonial mace of the parliament of ontario is the fourth mace to be used in upper canada or ontario . the first , second and third maces used in ontario , are

bearing edward 's initials on the cup was installed . eventually , it was replaced with the current cup which is adorned in gleaming brass leaves . through some careful detective work on the part of legislative assembly staff , the original cup with queen victoria 's monogram was recently found in the royal ontario museum 's collection and returned to the legislature . it is now on display in the ontario legislative building . in 2009 , two diamonds were installed in the mace . the diamonds were a gift to the people of ontario from de beers canada to mark the opening of the victor mine near attawapiskat first nation in northern ontario . three diamonds were selected from the first run of the mine . two stones , one rough and one polished , were set in platinum in the crown of the mace
