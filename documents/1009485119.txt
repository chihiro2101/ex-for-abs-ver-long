Guiana Space Centre

bec / ela-1 / elv . originally built in the 1960s under the name of base équatoriale du cecles ( bec ) , , the pad located at was designed for the europa ( rocket ) . one europa-ii was launched from the site , before the programme was cancelled . the pad was demolished , and subsequently rebuilt as the first launch complex for ariane rockets . renamed ela ( later redesignated ela-1 ) , it was used for ariane 1 and ariane 2 and 3 launches until being retired in 1989 . in november 2001 , it was renamed elv pad and refurbished again for the vega rocket . the first launch was performed on 13 february 2012 . . ela-2 . the ela-2 pad , located at had been used for ariane 4 launches until 2003 . ela-3 . ela-3 has been active for ariane 5 launches since 1996 ( ariane 501 ) . this facility is located at and covers an area of . . ela-4 . ela-4 is presently under construction , intended for future ariane 6 launches . this facility is located at . . els / soyuz at csg . esa has built els at for launching russian-built soyuz-2 rockets . the first soyuz launch from els was postponed several times , but launched on 21 october 2011 . spaceflightnow 's vs01 flight status page els is located on the territory of sinnamary commune , from kourou harbor . it is northwest of the site used for the ariane 5 launches . under the terms of the russo-european joint venture , esa will augment its own launch vehicle fleet with soyuz rockets — using them to launch esa or commercial payloads — and the russians will get access to the kourou spaceport for launching their own payloads with soyuz rockets . russia will use the guiana space centre in addition to baikonur cosmodrome . the guiana location has the significant benefit of greatly increased payload capability , owing to the near equatorial position . a soyuz rocket with a 1.7 tonnes to geostationary transfer orbit ( gto ) performance from baikonur , will increase its payload potential to 2.8 tonnes from the guiana launch site . le port spatial de l'europe ( cnes ) the els project is being co-funded by arianespace , esa , and the european union , with cnes being the prime contractor . the project has a projected cost of approximately €320 million , where €120 million are allocated for modernizing the soyuz vehicle . the official opening of the launch site construction occurred on 27 february 2007 . excavation work however , had previously begun several months beforehand . on 13 september 2010 , spaceflight now reported that after several delays in the construction of a mobile gantry the launch pad had been finished , and the first flight of the soyuz was expected to occur in early 2011 . by october 2010 , 18 launch contracts had been signed . arianespace has ordered 24 launchers from russian industry . on 21 october 2011 , two galileo iov-1 and iov-2 satellites were launched using a soyuz-2 rocket , in the '' first russian soyuz vehicle ever launched from europe 's spaceport in french guiana . '' . final assembly building . astrium assembles each ariane 5 launcher in the launcher integration building . the vehicle is then delivered to the final assembly building for payload integration by arianespace . the final assembly building is located from the ela-3 launch zone . the mobile launch table completes the trip with an ariane 5 in about one hour . it is then secured in place over the launch pad 's flame ducts . . launches . launch safety . fire safety is ensured by a detachment of the paris fire brigade , a branch of the french army . security around the base is ensured by french gendarmerie forces , assisted by the 3rd foreign infantry regiment of the french foreign legion . before and during launch windows , csg facility security is significantly enhanced by anti-personnel and anti-aircraft measures , the exact configurations of which are classified by the french military . all entrants to the launch complex are also subject to checks for proof of permission to enter the facility . the guiana space centre ( as per cnes ) also contains the îles du salut , a former penal colony including the infamous devil 's island . now a tourist site , the islands are under the launching trajectory for geosynchronous orbit and have to be evacuated during launches . early launches . 10 march 1970 - the first diamant launched the dial/mika and dial/wika satellites . dial/mika failed during launch , but it entered orbit with a total mass of 111 kg . dial/wika provided data for about two months after launch . . recent launches . 5 october 2007 — an ariane 5 launched from csg carrying intelsat 11 and optus d2 . 9 march 2008 — an ariane 5 launched carrying the atv ( automated transfer vehicle ) jules verne in preparation for docking with the international space station ( iss ) . this was the first launch of the esa unmanned resupply craft . 18 april 2008 — an ariane 5 launched carrying vinasat-1 — vietnam 's first satellite . 14 august 2008 — an ariane 5 carrying superbird 7 for mitsubishi electric and amc-21 for ses americom 20 december 2008 — an ariane 5 carrying hot bird and w2m for eutelsat 14 may 2009 — an ariane 5 carrying the esa 's herschel and planck space telescope 1 july 2009 — an ariane 5 carrying terrestar-1 , the heaviest commercial telecommunications satellite ever launched 18 december 2009 — an ariane 5 carrying helios 2b european military observation satellite used by france , belgium , spain and greece . 21 may 2011 — 04:38 ( gmt+08:00 ) an ariane 5 eca launch vehicle launched carrying st-2 satellite twice as powerful singtel 's first satellite st-1 which was launched back in 1998 . it will provide 20 % more transponder capacity and a wider coverage footprint than st-1 , with c-band and ku-band coverage of the middle east , central asia , indian subcontinent and southeast asia . 21 october 2011 — a soyuz-2 carrying two galileo satellites was launched . this was the first launch of a soyuz rocket at the centre spatial guyanais . 17 december 2011 — a soyuz carrying the french space agency 's pleiades 1 earth imaging satellite , four elisa electronic intelligence satellites , and the ssot remote sensing satellite for the chilean military . this was the second launch of a soyuz at the guiana space centre . 13 february 2012 — the vega , which was designed in italy , lifted off at 10:00 utc on its maiden voyage . the launcher released nine satellites into orbit : two italian satellites and seven small satellite . 5 july 2012 — the unmanned ariane 5 rocket took off to send an american communication satellite and european weather-monitoring spacecraft into orbit . liftoff occurred at 21:36 utc . 30 august 2013 — indian space research organisation ( isro ) launched the advanced multi-band communication satellite gsat-7 . india launches first defence satellite gsat-7 it was 17th indian satellite launched from esa with ariane 5 . navy 's first satellite gsat-7 now in the space the hindu , august 30 , 2013 by madhumati d . s . 16 october 2014 — an ariane 5 launch vehicle carrying the communication satellite arsat-1 to orbit . it is the first geostationary satellite built by an latin american country ( argentina ) , and the second one of the americas , after usa . 30 september 2015 — an ariane 5 launch vehicle carrying the communication satellite arsat-2 to orbit , being the second argentine geostationary satellite built in two years . 1 october 2015 — sky muster ( nbn-co 1a ) is a communication satellite launched on an ariane 5 launch vehicle . sky muster is the first satellite of an operation to improve australia 's internet with the nbn program . 6 october 2016 — sky muster ( nbn-co 1b ) is a communication satellite launched on an ariane 5 eca launch vehicle . sky muster ii is the second satellite of an operation to improve australia 's internet with the nbn program . 28 january 2017 — a soyuz-2 carrying the geostationary communication satellite hispasat ag1 to orbit . it is the first of the esa 's '' small-geo '' class of satellites . 14 february 2017 -
