the friedrich wilhelm university in berlin . he was taught by adolf rudorff , georg friedrich puchta , and friedrich schelling . at his father 's request , welti renounced an academic career and instead pursued law . in 1847 , he took part in the sonderbundskrieg as actuary of the commission of inquiry against the war council of the sonderbundes . from 1852 to 1856 , he was president of zurzach district court . career . cantonal and federal politics . in 1856 , welti was elected to the grand council of the canton of aargau and to the government council . during his first term , he was head of the justice department . he introduced a new criminal code , code of criminal procedure and the construction of lenzburg prison . from 1862 to 1866 , he stood ran education department and created a new school law . his demands for civil marriage and full legal equality for jews were not initially accepted . in the years 1858 , 1862 and 1866 , he was landammann . in 1857 , the great council elected welti to the council of states and confirmed it annually until 1866 . he immediately took a leading role and commented on issues such as the trade agreement with france and a railway line through the alps . in the years 1860 and 1866 , he was a council president . in 1860 , the federal council sent him to geneva as federal commissioner to mediate during the savoy trade talks . geneva gave him honorary citizenship . in 1864 he again intervened in geneva when trouble followed the state council elections riots . in 1866 , he received an honorary doctorate from the university of zurich , and in 1867 , honorary citizenship of the city of aarau . federal council . in the federal council elections in 1863 , welti lost to the incumbent friedrich frey-herosé . after the latter retired at the end of 1866 , welti became a promising candidate . he received support from the left wing as a supporter of a centralized state . representatives of the industry around '' railway king '' alfred escher backed him as a staunch supporter of the gotthard railway . in the election of the fifth member of the government on 8 december 1866 welti received in the first ballot 103 of 159 valid votes , taking office on 1 january 1867 . from the beginning , welti was one of the most influential figures in the state executive . during his 24-year tenure he represented four different departments : military department ( 1867–68 , 1870–71 , 1873–75 ) , political department ( 1869 , 1872 , 1876 , 1880 , 1884 ) , post and railway department ( 1877–79 , 1882–83 , 1885–91 ) and justice and police department ( 1881 ) . in the years 1869 , 1872 , 1876 , 1880 , 1884 and 1891 he was federal president . because of his appearance and his german-friendly attitude , he was sometimes referred to as '' swiss bismarck '' . as secretary of defense , welti pushed for the merger of the individual cantonal armies into a national army . the necessity became especially evident after the franco-prussian war of 1871 , when the army 's weakness was revealed and conflicts of competence with general hans herzog . in the debate on the revision of the federal constitution , welti represented a centralist position . however , the constitutional draft of 1872 , which was decisively influenced by him , narrowly failed referendum earning 50.5 % no votes . he had to accept federalist compromises , but he was able to enforce his most important concern , the unification of law , in the final constitution of 1874 . he kept himself largely out of the kulturkampf and took a mediating role . railroad policy was another focus . when asked whether the planned alpine railway should lead through the gotthard or the splügen , he could not intervene directly as a representative of the federal government , as the railway was a matter for the cantons and private companies . in negotiations , however , he was able to convince italy and the german reich to support the gotthard project and to subsidize it . he guaranteed the federal government a right of supervision and codetermination , since he did not want to leave this project of national importance to the private sector alone . in 1878 , when the company threatened to fail due to increasing costs , it was able to supply additional subsidies in parliament despite fierce opposition . for the first time in 1862 , the repurchase of private railways by the federal government became the subject of debate , but succumbed to the resistance of the circles around alfred escher . the situation changed with the railway crisis in the late 1870s . in 1883 , the confederation could finally have asserted its right of repurchase , but because of the overvaluation of its assets , the price would have been too high . welti put the financial management of the railway companies under federal supervision . after negotiations with the nordostbahn had failed , the federal government was able to take over in 1890 a large share of the jura-simplon-bahn . resignation . in 1891 , welti was able to conclude a repurchase agreement with the centralbahn , which was approved by parliament . a referendum came about , and on 6 december 1891 the repurchase agreement was rejected by a two-thirds majority . the same day , welti announced his retirement for the end of the year . parliament tried to dissuade him but accepted his resignation on 17 december . in 1898 his successor josef zemp nationalized the most important private railways . another reason for welti 's resignation may have been the family tragedy involving daughter-in-law lydia welti-escher , who took her own life on december 12 after she was locked up in a roman madhouse the year before . in politics , welti accepted no more tasks . on behalf of the federal council , however , he worked in trade and railway matters . he devoted himself to scientific studies and occasionally taught at the municipal gymnasium in bern . at the age of 73 , he died of concussion and pneumonia . during his time in office he held the following departments : military department ( 1867 & ndash ; 1868 ) political department as president of the confederation ( 1869 )
