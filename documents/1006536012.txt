Jay Gould

early life and education . gould was born in roxbury , new york , to mary more ( 1798–1841 ) and john burr gould ( 1792–1866 ) . his maternal grandfather alexander t . more was a businessman , and his great-grandfather john more was a scottish immigrant who founded the town of moresville , new york . gould studied at the hobart academy in hobart , new york , paying his way by bookkeeping . history of hobart high school as a young boy , he decided that he wanted nothing to do with farming , his father 's occupation , so his father dropped him off at a nearby school with fifty cents and a sack of clothes . h . w . brands '' masters of enterprise '' . early career . gould 's school principal was credited with getting him a job as a bookkeeper for a blacksmith . gould 's eventful life , a year later , the blacksmith offered him half interest in the blacksmith shop , which he sold to his father during the early part of 1854 . gould devoted himself to private study , emphasizing surveying and mathematics . in 1854 , he surveyed and created maps of the ulster county , new york , area . in 1856 , he published history of delaware county , and border wars of new york , which he had spent several years writing . in 1856 , gould entered a partnership with zadock pratt to create a tanning business in pennsylvania in an area that was later named gouldsboro . he eventually bought out pratt , who retired . in 1856 , gould entered a partnership with charles mortimer leupp , a son-in-law of gideon lee and one of the leading leather merchants in the united states . the partnership was successful , until the panic of 1857 . leupp lost all his money in that financial crisis , but gould took advantage of the depreciation in property value and bought up former partnership properties . the gouldsboro tannery became a disputed property after leupp 's death . leupp 's brother-in-law david w . lee was also a partner in leupp and gould , and he took armed control of the tannery . he believed that gould had cheated the leupp and lee families in the collapse of the business . gould eventually took physical possession , but he was later forced to sell his shares in the company to lee 's brother . '' david williamson lee 's career '' , the new york times , january 21 , 1886 . . railroad investing . in 1859 , gould began speculative investing by buying stock in small railways . his father-in-law daniel s . miller introduced him to the railroad industry by suggesting that gould help him save his investment in the rutland and washington railroad in the panic of 1857 . gould purchased stock for 10 cents on the dollar , which left him in control of the company . he engaged in more speculation on railroad stocks in new york city throughout the civil war , and he was appointed manager of the rensselaer and saratoga railroad in 1863 . the erie railroad encountered financial troubles in the 1850s , despite receiving loans from financiers cornelius vanderbilt and daniel drew . it entered receivership in 1859 and was reorganized as the erie railway . gould , drew , and james fisk engaged in stock manipulations known as the erie war , and drew , fisk , and vanderbilt lost control of the erie in the summer of 1868 , while gould became its president . schafer , mike ( 2000 ) . more classic american railroads . mbi publishing company . p . 47 . retrieved september 22 , 2016.iarchive : moreclassicameri00mike read on archive.org it was during the same period that gould and fisk became involved with tammany hall , the democratic party political machine that largely ran new york city at the time . they made its boss , boss tweed , a director of the erie railroad , and tweed arranged favorable legislation . tweed and gould became the subjects of political cartoons by thomas nast in 1869 . gould was the chief bondsman in october 1871 when tweed was held on 1 million bail . tweed was eventually convicted of corruption and died in jail . . black friday . in august 1869 , gould and fisk began to buy gold in an attempt to corner the market , hoping that the increase in the price of gold would increase the price of wheat and motivate western farmers to sell . this , in turn , would cause a great amount of shipping eastward , increasing freight business for the erie railroad . during this time , gould used contacts with president ulysses s . grant 's brother-in-law abel corbin to influence the president and his secretary general horace porter . these speculations culminated in the panic of black friday on september 24 , 1869 , when the greenback ( cash ) premium over face value fell on a gold double eagle from 62 percent to 35 percent . gould made a small profit from this operation by hedging against his own attempted corner as it was about to collapse , but he lost it in subsequent lawsuits . the gold corner established gould 's reputation in the press as an all-powerful figure who could drive the market up and down at will . lord gordon-gordon . in 1873 , gould attempted to take control of the erie railroad by recruiting foreign investments from lord gordon-gordon , supposedly a cousin of the wealthy clan campbell who was buying land for immigrants . he bribed gordon-gordon with a million dollars in stock , but gordon-gordon was an impostor and cashed the stock immediately . gould sued him , and the case went to trial in march 1873 . in court , gordon-gordon gave the names of the europeans whom he claimed to represent , and he was granted bail while the references were checked . he immediately fled to canada , where he convinced authorities that the charges were false . having failed to convince canadian authorities to hand over gordon-gordon , gould attempted to kidnap gordon-gordon with the help of his associates and future members of congress loren fletcher , john gilfillan , and eugene mclanahan wilson . the group captured him successfully , but they were stopped and arrested by the north-west mounted police before they could return to the us . canadian authorities put them in prison and refused them bail , and this led to an international incident between the united states and canada . governor horace austin of minnesota demanded their return when he learned that they had been denied bail , and he put the local militia on full readiness , and thousands of minnesotans volunteered for an invasion of canada . after negotiations , the canadian authorities released them on bail . gordon-gordon was eventually ordered to be deported but committed suicide before the order could be carried out . . western railroads . after being forced out of the erie railroad , gould started to build up a system of railroads in the midwest and west . he took control of the union pacific in 1873 when its stock was depressed by the panic of 1873 , and he built a viable railroad that depended on shipments from farmers and ranchers . he immersed himself in every operational and financial detail of the union pacific system , building an encyclopedic knowledge and acting decisively to shape its destiny . biographer maury klein states that '' he revised its financial structure , waged its competitive struggles , captained its political battles , revamped its administration , formulated its rate policies , and promoted the development of resources along its lines .
