Small Magellanic Cloud

observation history . in the southern hemisphere , the magellanic clouds have long been included in the lore of native inhabitants , including south sea islanders and indigenous australians . persian astronomer al sufi labelled the larger of the two clouds as al bakr , the white ox . european sailors may have first noticed the clouds during the middle ages when they were used for navigation . portuguese and dutch sailors called them the cape clouds , a name that was retained for several centuries . during the circumnavigation of the earth by ferdinand magellan in 1519 & ndash ; 22 , they were described by antonio pigafetta as dim clusters of stars . in johann bayer 's celestial atlas uranometria , published in 1603 , he named the smaller cloud , nubecula minor . in latin , nubecula means a little cloud . between 1834 and 1838 , john frederick william herschel made observations of the southern skies with his reflector from the royal observatory . while observing the nubecula minor , he described it as a cloudy mass of light with an oval shape and a bright center . within the area of this cloud he catalogued a concentration of 37 nebulae and clusters . in 1891 , harvard college observatory opened an observing station at arequipa in peru . between 1893 and 1906 , under the direction of solon bailey , the telescope at this site was used to survey photographically both the large and small magellanic clouds . henrietta swan leavitt , an astronomer at the harvard college observatory , used the plates from arequipa to study the variations in relative luminosity of stars in the smc . in 1908 , the results of her study were published , which showed that a type of variable star called a '' cluster variable '' , later called a cepheid variable after the prototype star delta cephei , showed a definite relationship between the variability period and the star 's apparent brightness . leavitt reaized that since all the stars in the smc are roughly the same distance from earth , this result implied that there is similar relationship between period and absolute brightness . this important period-luminosity relation allowed the distance to any other cepheid variable to be estimated in terms of the distance to the smc . she hoped a few cepheid variables could be found close enough to earth so that their parallax , and hence distance from earth , could be measured . this soon happened , allowing cepheid variables to be used as standard candles , facilitating many astronomical discoveries . using this period-luminosity relation , in 1913 the distance to the smc was first estimated by ejnar hertzsprung . first he measured thirteen nearby cepheid variables to find the absolute magnitude of a variable with a period of one day . by comparing this to the periodicity of the variables as measured by leavitt , he was able to estimate a distance of 10,000 parsecs ( 30,000 light years ) between the sun and the smc . this later proved to be a gross underestimate of the true distance , but it did demonstrate the potential usefulness of this technique . announced in 2006 , measurements with the hubble space telescope suggest the large and small magellanic clouds may be moving too fast to be orbiting the milky way . . features . there is a bridge of gas connecting the small magellanic cloud with the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , which is evidence of tidal interaction between the galaxies . the magellanic clouds have a common envelope of neutral hydrogen indicating they have been gravitationally bound for a long time . this bridge of gas is a star-forming site . in 2017 , using dark energy survey plus maglites data , a stellar over-density associated with the small magellanic cloud was discovered , which is probably the result of interactions between smc and lmc . . x-ray sources . the small magellanic cloud contains a large and active population of x-ray binary . recent star formation has led to a large population of massive stars and high-mass x-ray binaries ( hmxbs ) which are the relics of the short-lived upper end of the initial mass function . the young stellar population and the majority of the known x-ray binaries are concentrated in the smc 's bar . hmxb pulsars are rotating neutron stars in binary systems with be-type ( spectral type 09-b2 , luminosity classes v–iii ) or supergiant stellar companions . most hmxbs are of the be type which account for 70 % in the milky way and 98 % in the smc . coe et al . 2005 the be-star equatorial disk provides a reservoir of matter that can be accreted onto the neutron star during periastron passage ( most known systems have large orbital eccentricity ) or during large-scale disk ejection episodes . this scenario leads to strings of x-ray outbursts with typical x-ray luminosities l x & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 10 36 –10 37 & nbsp ; erg/s , spaced at the orbital period , plus infrequent giant outbursts of greater duration and luminosity . negueruela 1998 for a review monitoring surveys of the smc performed with nasa 's rossi x-ray timing explorer ( rxte ) laycock et al . 2005 ; galache et al . 2008 see x-ray pulsars in outburst at more than 10 36 erg/s and have counted 50 by the end of 2008 . the rosat and asca missions detected many faint x-ray point sources , haberl & sasaki 2000 but the typical positional uncertainties frequently made positive identification difficult . recent studies using xmm-newton haberl et al . 2008 ; haberl & pietsch 2004 and chandra antoniou et al . 2009 ; edge et al . 2004 , and laycock et al . 2010 have now cataloged several hundred x-ray sources in the direction of the smc , of which perhaps half are considered likely hmxbs , and the remainder a mix of foreground stars , and background agn . no x-rays above background were observed from the magellanic clouds during the september 20 , 1966 , nike-tomahawk flight . balloon observation from mildura , australia , on october 24 , 1967 , of the smc set an upper limit of x-ray detection . an x-ray astronomy instrument was carried aboard a thor missile launched from johnston atoll on september 24 , 1970 , at 12:54 utc for altitudes above 300 & nbsp ; km , to search for the small magellanic cloud . the smc was detected with an x-ray luminosity of 5 ergs/s in the range 1.5–12 kev , and 2.5 ergs/s in the range 5–50 kev for an apparently extended source . the fourth uhuru catalog lists an early x-ray source within the constellation tucana : 4u 0115-73 ( 3u 0115-73 , 2a 0116-737 , smc x-1 ) . uhuru observed the smc on january 1 , 12 , 13 , 16 , and 17 , 1971 , and detected one source located at 01149-7342 , which was then designated smc x-1 . some x-ray counts were also received on january 14 , 15 , 18 , and 19 , 1971 . the third ariel 5 catalog ( 3a ) also contains this early x-ray source within tucana : 3a 0116-736 ( 2a 0116-737 , smc x-1 ) . the smc x-1 , a hmxrb , is at j2000 right ascension ( ra ) declination ( dec ) . two additional sources detected and listed in 3a include smc x-2 at 3a 0042-738 and smc x-3 at 3a 0049-726 . . mini magellanic cloud ( mmc ) . it has been proposed by astrophysicists d . s . mathewson , v . l . ford and n . visvanathan that the smc may in fact be split in two , with a smaller section of this galaxy behind the main part of the smc ( as seen from earth perspective ) , and separated by about 30,000 ly . they suggest the reason for this is due to a past interaction with the lmc splitting the smc , and that the two sections are still moving apart . they have dubbed this smaller remnant the mini magellanic cloud . . see also . small magellanic cloud in fiction large magellanic cloud magellanic clouds objects within the small magellanic cloud : ngc 265 ngc 290 ngc 346 ngc 602 . references . external links . nasa extragalactic database entry on the smc seds entry on the smc smc at esa/hubble astronomy picture of the day 2010 january 7 the tail of the small magellanic cloud - likely stripped from the galaxy by gravitational tides , the tail contains mostly gas , dust , and newly formed stars . a stellar over-density associated with the small magellanic cloud
