Gherman Titov

biography . titov was born in the village of verkhneye zhilino in the altai krai and went to school at the stalingrad military aviation school . after graduating as an air force pilot , he was selected for cosmonaut training in 1960 . he flew the vostok 2 mission launched on 6 august 1961 . it lasted for 25.3 hours and he performed 17 orbits of the earth . his call sign was eagle . he landed close to the town of krasny kut in saratov oblast , russia . a month short of 26 years old at launch , he remains the youngest person to fly in space . titov was a member of the communist party of the soviet union , as were almost all the soviet cosmonauts . titov was a fine sportsman , and keen on gymnastics : he was the first person to suffer from space sickness ( motion sickness in space ) and was also the first person to sleep in space . he slept for roughly one orbit and was surprised to wake with his arms floating in the air because of the absence of normal gravity . he returned to sleep after he had his arms under a security belt and slept 30 minutes more than predicted by the flight plan . he stated , '' once you have your arms and legs arranged properly , space sleep is fine . i slept like a baby '' . english version of titov 's biography . though he had been suffering from space sickness during his orbit , titov celebrated upon landing . his celebration is described as '' a fit of euphoria '' after landing , and on his return flight to kubishev for debriefing , he alarmed the medical staff by opening and downing a beer , in complete violation of the rules . after landing , titov landed and was sent to hospital for further testing to ensure that he was not sick . after his mission , he reportedly engaged in behaviours that could be considered unacceptable for someone working within the space programme . he is reported to have been enthralled in his love of women , excessive drinking , and fast cars , which caused some to theorise that his behaviour had potentially been another side effect of the space sickness he experienced from zero gravity . further testing revealed that not to be the case . during a widely-publicised 1962 visit to seattle to tour the century 21 world 's fair , titov was asked by reporters how his space flight affected his philosophy of life . he replied : '' sometimes people are saying that god is out there . i was looking around attentively all day but i did n't find anybody there . i saw neither angels nor god '' . soviet cosmonaut gherman titov visits seattle 's century 21 exposition on may 5 and may 6 , 1962 historylink.org . essay 10104 . the utterance was famously used in soviet anti-religion propaganda , but it was misattributed to yuri gagarin . following his space flight , titov assumed various senior positions in the soviet space programme until his retirement in 1992 . in 1995 , he was elected to the state duma as a member of the communist party . he died of cardiac arrest in his sauna at the age of 65 in moscow . умер второй космонавт планеты герман титов lenta.ru , 2000-09-21 .
