Heaven 17

history . 1980s . ian craig marsh and martyn ware were the founding members of pioneering british electro-pop group the human league ; glenn gregory had been their original choice when seeking a lead singer for the band but he was unavailable at the time , so they chose philip oakey instead . when personal and creative tensions within the group reached a breaking point in late 1980 , marsh and ware left the band , ceding the human league name to oakey . taking their new name from a fictional pop band mentioned in anthony burgess 's dystopian novel , a clockwork orange ( where the heaven seventeen are at number 4 in the charts with '' inside '' ) , they became heaven 17 and formed the production company british electric foundation ( b.e.f . ) . b.e.f . 's first recordings were a cassette-only album called music for stowaways and an lp called music for listening to , which was re-released on cd in 1997 with two extra tracks . shortly after , they completed their line-up when they recruited their friend , photographer glenn gregory , as vocalist . like the human league , heaven 17 used synthesisers and drum machines heavily ( the linn lm-1 programmed by ware ) . session musicians were used for bass guitar and guitar ( john wilson ) and grand piano ( nick plytas ) . whereas the band 's former colleagues the human league had gone on to major chart success in 1981 , heaven 17 struggled to make an impact . their debut single '' ( we do n't need this ) fascist groove thang '' attracted some attention and , due to its overtly left-wing politics lyrics , was banned by the bbc due to concerns by radio 1 's legal department that it libelled ronald reagan , who had recently been elected president of the united states . neither this nor any other of the four singles taken from the band 's debut album penthouse and pavement managed to reach the top 40 in the uk singles chart . the album itself proved to be a success , peaking at number 14 on the uk albums chart , and was later certified gold by the bpi in 1982 . was unable to complete the album . in october 1982 , heaven 17 released their new single '' let me go '' , which charted just outside the uk top 40 ( but reached the irish top 30 ) . however , in 1983 the band 's fortunes changed . their next single , '' temptation '' ( on which they were augmented by vocalist carol kenyon and a studio orchestra ) , reached number 2 on the uk singles chart in spring 1983 and became their biggest hit . the song was taken from their second album , the luxury gap , which featured further chart hits '' come live with me '' ( uk 5 ) and '' crushed by the wheels of industry '' ( uk 17 ) . the album itself charted at number 4 on the uk albums chart , their highest ever position , and was certified platinum by the bpi in 1984 . , plus frequent mtv exposure . towards the end of 1983 , the band ( under their b.e.f . guise and assisted by greg walsh ) helped relaunch tina turner 's career , producing , and providing backing vocals on her hit '' let 's stay together '' , a cover of the al green song . 1984 saw the release of heaven 17 's third studio album , how men are , which reached number 12 in the uk albums chart and was certified silver by the bpi . the album featured the earth , wind & fire brass section , and two singles from the album ( '' sunset now '' and '' this is mine '' ) both reached the uk top 40 , but would be the band 's last singles to do so until various remixes were released in the 1990s . the band also worked on the band aid single '' do they know it 's christmas ? '' at the end of 1984 , with gregory supplying vocals alongside midge ure and sting , after a personal request from ure that he attend . however , the band did not perform at live aid the following year . heaven 17 's first '' live '' performance was in 1986 on the uk television programme the tube ( though the band made use of backing tapes during this performance ) . after the remix album endless peaked at number 70 in july 1986 , the band 's fourth studio album pleasure one was released in november 1986 and featured the single '' trouble '' ( uk no . 51 , germany 17 ) . the album contained a number of songs that were originally intended for a french film project that never came to be . this was also the first heaven 17 album to not mention production credits for b.e.f . and the abbreviation would not appear again until the bigger than america album in 1996 . it was followed up in 1988 with the album teddy bear , duke & psycho ( featuring the singles '' train of love in motion '' and '' the ballad of go go brown '' ) , although these two albums were poorly received and had little commercial success . in september 1988 , the band appeared on the bill at the sport aid event in sheffield . heaven 17 were managed by keith bourton for heavenly management ltd . during much of this period . 1990s . the early 1990s was a quiet period for the band , though ware produced a second b.e.f . album in 1991 , to follow 1982 's original music of quality & distinction . this album again featured tina turner and billy mackenzie , but this time also featured artists such as scritti politti 's green gartside , lalah hathaway , billy preston , and chaka khan . ware also became a producer for the likes of terence trent d'arby , soft cell 's marc almond , and erasure . gregory , meanwhile , went on to form the band honeyroot with keith lowndes , then ugly with john uriel and ian wright . in late 1992 , a brothers in rhythm remix of '' temptation '' reached number 4 and was followed by the compilation album higher and higher â€“ the best of heaven 17 in 1993 . remixes of '' ( we do n't need this ) fascist groove thang '' and '' penthouse and pavement '' were also minor hits in 1993 . however , the band would not release any new material as heaven 17 until 1996 's bigger than america . the album failed to chart in the uk . . 2000s . the year 2005 saw the release of a new studio album , before after , which had a much more contemporary dance sound compared to previous albums . a cd composed entirely of remixes of the song '' hands up to heaven '' from the album reached number six on the us billboard dance club songs chart in may 2006 . in october of the same year , virgin records issued a greatest hits compilation album entitled sight and sound , which included a previously-unheard version of '' temptation '' with spoken vocals by an unknown student from germany whom the band met in 1982 . it had been discovered on 1-inch tape by gregory 's mother and was remastered by simon heyworth . in november 2005 , heaven 17 were filmed for a live dvd playing to a packed house at the scala in london . the dvd contains an in-depth question-and-answer session with both ware and gregory , along with fans ' reactions to the gig . in december 2008 , heaven 17 toured the uk as part of the sheffield band-based steel city tour alongside the human league and abc . coinciding with this was the release of their new album , naked as advertised , issued through the just music record label . the album contained re-workings of tracks such as '' temptation '' along with versions of ware songs best known from his time with the human league , including '' being boiled '' and '' empire state human '' , as well as a cover of the associates ' hit '' party fears two '' . the band were managed by nick ashton-hart for much of the early 2000s . in december 2009 , heaven 17 made appearances at the '' nokia night of the proms '' in germany . . 2010s . on 16 february 2010 , heaven 17 joined la roux to record a joint live session for the bbc which was shown on the bbc red button interactive channel in january 2010 . glenn gregory joined la roux on stage at glastonbury festival on 26 june 2010 , performing '' temptation '' .
