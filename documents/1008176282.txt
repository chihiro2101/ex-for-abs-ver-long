'' he also remained active in politics , being elected to the central committee of the young finnish party . in 1908 , ståhlberg was elected as a member of parliament for the southern häme constituency , which he represented until 1910 . he also served as a member for the southern oulu constituency from 1913 until his appointment as president of the supreme administrative court in 1918 . ståhlberg also served as speaker of the parliament in 1914 . after the february revolution in 1917 , ståhlberg was backed by the majority of the non-socialists members of parliament as a candidate to become vice-chairman of the economic department of the senate . however , he did not receive the support of the social democrats , which he had made a precondition of his being elected . instead , the social democrat oskari tokoi was elected , with ståhlberg being appointed as chairman of the constitutional council . this body had been set up earlier to draw up plans for a new form of government for finland , in light of the events surrounding the february revolution and the abdication of nicholas ii as emperor of russia and grand duke of finland . the new form of government approved by the council was largely based on the 1772 instrument of government , dating from the period of swedish rule . the proposed form of government was rejected by the russian provisional government , and was then left largely forgotten for a time due to the confusion and urgency of the situation surrounding the october revolution and the declaration of finland 's independence . architect of the finnish constitution . after finland gained its independence in december 1917 , the constitutional committee drafted new proposals for a form of government of an independent republic of finland . as chairman of the council , ståhlberg was involved in the drafting and re-drafting of constitutional proposals during 1918 , when the impact of the finnish civil war , and debates between republicans and monarchists on the future constitution , all led to various proposals . his proposals would eventually be enacted as the constitution of finland in 1919 . in 1918 , ståhlberg supported the idea of republic instead of a constitutional monarchy which was supported by more conservative victors of the civil war . ståhlberg 's appointment as the first president of the supreme administrative court in 1918 meant that he relinquished his role as a member of parliament , and was therefore not involved in the election by the parliament of prince frederick charles of hesse as king of finland in october of that year . as it became clear that finland would be a republic , stålberg also championed direct election of the president of finland , but the council of state chose the electoral college system , although the first president would be elected by parliament . first president of finland . ståhlberg emerged as a candidate for president , with the support of the newly formed kansallinen edistyspuolue , of which he was a member , and the agrarian league . in the 1919 finnish presidential election , he was elected by parliament as president of the republic on 25 july 1919 , defeating carl gustaf mannerheim ( the candidate supported by the national coalition and swedish people 's parties ) by 143 votes to 50 . see , for example , sakari virkkunen , '' finland 's presidents i , '' helsinki , 1994 ståhlberg was inaugurated as the first president of the republic on the following day , and reluctantly moved out of his home in helsinki to take up residence in the presidential palace . see , for example , virkkunen 1994 as president , ståhlberg was very formal and , due to his shyness , wrote everything he had to say in public beforehand . he also had a distaste for official occasions , and it was not solely due to foreign-policy reasons that he declined to make a state visit to sweden . he had been a widower since 1917 , but in 1920 , he married his second wife , ester ståhlberg ( 1870–1950 ) . as the first president of the republic , ståhlberg had to form various presidential precedents and interpretations of how the office of president should be conducted . his term in office was also marked by a succession of short-lived governments . during his time as president , ståhlberg nominated and appointed eight governments . these were mostly coalitions of the agrarians and the national progressive , national coalition and swedish people 's parties , although ståhlberg also appointed two caretaker governments . importantly , ståhlberg generally supported all the governments that he nominated , although he also sometimes disagreed with them . he forced kyösti kallio 's first government to resign in january 1924 , when he demanded early elections to restore the full membership of parliament - 200 deputies - and kallio disagreed . the parliament had lacked 27 deputies since august 1923 , when the communist deputies had been arrested on suspicions of treason . sakari virkkunen , '' the finnish presidents i : ståhlberg - relander - svinhufvud '' / suomen presidentit i : ståhlberg - relander - svinhufvud , helsinki : otava publications ltd . , 1994 ståhlberg supported moderate social and economic reforms to make even the former reds accept the democratic republic . he pardoned most of the red prisoners , despite the strong criticism that this aroused from many right-wing finns , especially the white veterans of the civil war and several senior army officers . he signed into law bills that gave the trade unions an equal power with the employers ' organizations to negotiate labour contracts , a bill to improve the public care for the poor , and the lex kallio law which distributed land from the wealthy landowners to the former tenant farmers and other landless rural people . see , for example , virkkunen , '' the finnish presidents i '' ; '' forum iv : turning points of the finnish history from the autonomy to the present '' / forum iv . suomen historian käännekohtia autonomiasta nykypäivään ( an upper-secondary school history textbook ) , helsinki : otava , 2005–2006 in foreign policy ståhlberg was markedly reserved towards sweden , largely as a consequence of the åland crisis , which marked the early years of his presidency . he was also cautious towards germany , and generally unsuccessful in his attempts to establish closer contacts with poland , the united kingdom and france . post-presidential life . ståhlberg did not seek re-election in 1925 , finding his difficult term of office a great strain . he also believed that the right-wing and the monarchists would become more reconciled to the republic if he stepped down . according to the longtime late agrarian and centrist politician johannes virolainen , he believed that the incumbent president was too much favoured over the other candidates while standing for re-election . see virolainen , '' the last electoral term '' / viimeinen vaalikausi , published in finland in 1991 he was offered the post of chancellor of the university of helsinki , but declined it , instead becoming a member of the government 's law drafting committee . he also served as a national progressive member of parliament again , as a member for the uusimaa constituency from 1930 to 1933 . in 1930 , activists from the right-wing lapua movement kidnapped him and his wife , attempting to send them to the soviet union , but the incident merely hastened the lapua movement 's demise . ståhlberg was a national progressive party candidate in the 1931 presidential election , eventually losing to pehr evind svinhufvud by only two votes in the third ballot . he was also a candidate in the 1937 election , eventually finishing third . in 1946 , ståhlberg retired and became the legal adviser of president juho kusti paasikivi . paasikivi often consulted ståhlberg , for example on the 1950 presidential election which ståhlberg believed should be normal , if the finnish people wanted to deserve an independent republic . their last discussion occurred less than two weeks before ståhlberg died . see , for example , '' j.k . paasikivi's diaries i-ii '' / j.k . paasikiven päiväkirjat i-ii , edited and published in finland around 1985-86 he died in 1952 , and was buried in helsinki 's hietaniemi cemetery with full honours . among finnish presidents , ståhlberg has retained a remarkably impeccable reputation . he is generally regarded as a moral and principled defender of democracy and of the rule of law , and as the father of the finnish constitution . his decision to voluntarily give up the presidency is also generally speaking admired as a sign that he was not a power-hungry career politician . see , for example , '' the republic 's presidents 1919-1931 '' / tasavallan presidentit 1919-1931 , published in finland in 1993-94 . honours . awards and decorations . : grand cross of the order of the white rose ( finland ) : grand cross of the order of the cross of liberty : cross of liberty ( estonia ) : order of the three stars
