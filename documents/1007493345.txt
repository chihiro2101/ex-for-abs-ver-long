Irish whiskey

historical distilleries . throughout the 18th and 19th centuries , around 1,000 registered distilleries opened and closed across ireland - with multiples of this number operating illegally . most of these have disappeared without a trace , only to be remembered by local street names e.g . bond street in dublin . for instance , the excise return for 1800 lists 40 distilleries operating in dublin city alone , while drogheda is estimated to have had 15 distilleries in the 1780s , with as many as ten operating in cork city in the 19th century . of these numerous ventures , only one , bushmills , has remained in continuous operation until the present day . however , the kilbeggan distillery ( est . 1757 ) which closed in 1954 , reopened in recent years , while a new distillery was constructed in tullamore to replace an existing distillery which also closed in 1954 . some of the notable distilleries previously in operation across ireland are listed below . avoniel , belfast , county antrim ( 1882–1929 ) belfast distillery , belfast , county antrim ( 1823–1868 ) cromac distillery , belfast , county antrim ( 1776–1930 ) irish distillery , connswater , belfast , county antrim ( 1886–1929 ) dunville & co , belfast , county antrim ( 1868–1938 or later ) – among ireland 's largest distilleries in the 1890s , the royal irish was the home of dunville 's whisky . although the distillery is now gone , dunville 's was resurrected as an irish whiskey brand by the echlinville distillery in 2013 . bandon distillery , bandon , county cork ( 1826–1929 ) – at its peak , allman 's distillery in bandon was the largest rural distillery in ireland , with an output of over 500,000 gallons per annum . glen distillery , kilnap , county cork ( 1802–1925 ) hackett 's distillery , midleton , county cork ( 1824 – c . 1845 ) old midleton distillery , midleton . county cork ( 1825–1975 ) – home to the world 's largest pot still , the old midleton distillery closed in 1975 when irish distillers concentrated production in a new purpose-built facility constructed along the distillery . it now operates as a visitor centre . north mall distillery , cork , county cork ( 1779–1920 ) watercourse distillery , cork , county cork ( 1795–1975 ) green distillery , blackpool , county cork ( 1796–1870 ) daly 's distillery , county cork ( 1807–1869 ) burt distillery , county donegal ( 1814–1841 ) comber distilleries , county down ( 1825–1953 ) bow street distillery , dublin ( 1780–1971 ) – run by john jameson & son , bow street was one of the '' big four '' dublin distilleries and the original home of jameson irish whiskey . at its peak bow street was the second largest distillery in ireland and one of the largest in the world , with an output of one million gallons per annum . in the 1970s , production was moved to the new midleton distillery , county cork and the bow street distillery now operates as a visitors ' centre . dodder bank distilleries , dublin john 's lane distillery , dublin ( 1796–1976 ) – run by james power & son , john 's lane was one of the '' big four '' dublin distilleries , and the original home of powers ( whiskey ) . the distillery had an output of 900,000 gallons per annum in the 1880s . production was moved to midleton in the 1970s . jones road distillery , dublin ( 1873 – c . 1945 ) marrowbone lane distillery , dublin ( late 1700s–1920s ) – one of the '' big four '' dublin distilleries , marrowbone lane was run by william jameson & co .

whiskey comes in several forms , with the name of the style depending on the type of grain used and the distillation process . traditionally , irish whiskey was produced in pot stills . irish whiskeys made in a pot still fall into two categories . single malt irish whiskey . whiskeys made entirely from malted barley distilled in a pot still within a single distillery are referred to as single malt whiskeys , a style also very commonly associated with scotch whisky . these may be double or triple distilled . . single pot still whiskey . single pot still whiskey is made from a mixture of malted and unmalted barley completely distilled in a pot still within a single distillery . this differs from single malt whiskey through the inclusion of raw , unmalted grain in the mash . this style has also historically been referred to as '' pure pot still '' whiskey and '' irish pot still whiskey '' , with older bottlings and memorabilia often bearing these names . single pot whiskeys were the most common style of irish whiskey until the emergence of blends in the 20th century . . grain whiskey . whiskey produced from continuous distillation in a column or coffey still , rather than a pot still , is referred to as grain whiskey . this may be produced from a variety of grains . lighter and more neutral in taste , this spirit is rarely found on its own , though some examples exist . the vast majority of grain whiskey is used to make blended whiskey , a product made by mixing column still product with richer and more intense pot still product . blended whiskey . a mixture of the above styles . regardless of whether the blended whiskey is made from combining grain whiskey with either single malt whiskey or with single pot still whiskey or both , it is labelled with the same terminology . blended whiskeys are now the most common style of both irish and scotch whiskeys . . examples . blends : black bush , bushmills original , clontarf , inishowen , jameson , kilbeggan ,
