List of one-hit wonders in the United States

criteria . music reviewers and journalists sometimes describe a musical artist as a one-hit wonder , based on their professional assessment of chart success , sales figures , and fame . for the purpose of his book the billboard book of one-hit wonders , music journalist wayne jancik defines a one-hit wonder as '' an act that has won a position on billboards national , pop , top 40 just once . '' in his definition of an '' act '' , jancik distinguishes between a solo performer and any group he or she may have performed in ( thus , for example , roger daltrey 's '' without your love '' is counted despite daltrey 's numerous hits as frontman for the who ) , and a number of musicians appear multiple times , either with multiple bands or as a member of a band and as a solo artist . ( eponymous bands are generally not separated ; thus charlie daniels is not counted as a one-hit wonder for '' uneasy rider '' and the hits of the charlie daniels band are credited to him . ) fred bronson , a journalist and former writer for billboard magazine , in his book billboard 's hottest hot 100 hits , uses the criterion that an artist is ineligible to be categorized as a '' one-hit wonder '' if they have a second song listed on the billboard hot 100 . in both cases , the billboard hot 100 was used as an objective standard for one-hit wonder status , since billboard magazine published the books . disc jockey and music writer brent mann points out how some artists have been called a '' one-hit wonder '' despite having other charting singles ; in these cases , one signature song so overshadows the rest of the artist 's discography that only that song remains familiar to later audiences . as an example , english-born singer albert hammond enjoyed success with '' it never rains in southern california '' ( 1972 ) rising to number 5 in the us , but his follow-up single , '' i 'm a train '' was dismissed by mann as '' totally forgotten '' even though it charted at number 31 in 1974 . in another case , scottish rockers simple minds followed their big hit '' do n't you ( forget about me ) '' ( appearing in the opening and closing scenes of the film the breakfast club ) with '' alive and kicking '' which peaked at number 3 in the us , '' sanctify yourself '' which peaked at number 14 in the us , and '' all the things she said '' which peaked at number 28 in the us , yet the band is remembered primarily for the first song . on the other hand , some artists with long , successful careers have been identified as one-hit wonders by virtue of having reached the top 40 of the hot 100 only once . consequence of sound editor matt melis lists beck ( '' loser '' ) and the grateful dead ( '' touch of grey '' ) as '' technically '' being one-hit wonders despite their large bodies of work . entertainment weekly mentions prolific artist frank zappa as a one-hit wonder because his only top 40 hit was '' valley girl '' in 1982 . chris molanphy says that an artist can only be seen as a '' one hit wonder '' if they have never had a second billboard top 10 hit , if any subsequent top 40 singles were released within six months of their first big hit , and if the artist has not had three or more top 10 or platinum albums . . multiple appearances . british musician tony burrows sang the lead vocal on five one-hit wonders : edison lighthouse 's '' love grows ( where my rosemary goes ) '' ( february 1970 ) ; white plains ' '' my baby loves lovin ' '' ( march 1970 ) ; the pipkins ' '' gim me dat ding '' ( april 1970 ) ; the first class ' '' beach baby '' ( july 1974 ) ; and '' united we stand '' ( 1970 ) by the first incarnation of the brotherhood of man . joey levine , american session singer best known for his prolific work in the bubblegum pop and commercial jingle genera , who had recorded hits for the ohio express ( '' yummy yummy yummy '' ) , also sang hits for the third rail , the kasenetz-katz singing orchestral circus ( '' quick joey small '' ) and reunion ( '' life is a rock ( but the radio rolled me ) '' ) . cooper , kim ( april 26 , 2006 ) . speech awarding joey levine the bubblegum achievement award . retrieved from the internet archive june 26 , 2019 . british singer limahl sang lead vocal on two us one-hit wonder songs ; the first , '' too shy '' in 1983 , came during his tenure as the frontman for the group kajagoogoo . the next year , he had another hit single as a solo artist with '' the neverending story '' , the title track to the film the neverending story . the latter song charted at number 17 in may 1985 . it could be argued that if a lead singer appears in more than one top 40 hit , then that artist should not qualify as a '' one-hit-wonder '' . . list of one-hit wonders in the us . each artist listed here has been identified by at least two publications as being a one-hit wonder in the u.s . some artists listed here have reached the top 40 of the billboard hot 100 more than once . the year indicates when the song charted or peaked . 1950s . lillian briggs “ i want you to be my baby ” ( 1955 ) jancik , wayne , the billboard book of one hit wonders , billboard books , new york 1998 p.8 briggs , lillian , lillian briggs , i want you to be my baby , jasmine reccords , london , compact disc , jascd 282 dale hawkins -
