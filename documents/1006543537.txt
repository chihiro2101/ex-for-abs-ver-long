Bunhill Fields

historical background . bunhill fields was part of the manor of finsbury ( originally fensbury ) , which has its origins as the prebend of halliwell and finsbury , belonging to st paul 's cathedral and established in 1104 . in 1315 the prebendary manor was granted by archdeacon robert baldock to the mayor and commonalty of london . this enabled more general public access to the semi-fen or moor stretching from the city of london 's boundary ( london wall ) , to the village of hoxton . in 1498 part of the otherwise unenclosed landscape was set aside to form a large field for military exercises of archers and others . this part of the manor has sports and occasional military use : artillery ground . next to this lies bunhill fields . the name derives from '' bone hill '' , likely linked to occasional burials from at least saxon times , but more probably derives from the use for mass-deposit for human bones—amounting to over 1,000 cartloads—brought from st paul 's charnel house in 1549 ( when that building was demolished ) . holmes 1896 , pp . 133–34 . the dried bones were deposited on the moor and capped with a thin layer of soil . this built up a hill across the otherwise damp , flat fens , such that three windmills could safely be erected in a spot that came to be one of the many windmill hills . opening as a burial ground . in keeping with this tradition , in 1665 the city of london corporation decided to use some of the land as a common burial ground for the interment of bodies of inhabitants who had died of the plague and could not be accommodated in the churchyards . outer walls were completed but church of england officials never consecrated the ground nor used it for burials . a mr . tindal took over the lease . he allowed extramural graveyard burials in what was unconsecrated soil , thus popular with nonconformists—those protestantism who practised their faiths outside the church of england ; unlike anglican , jewish and catholic grounds it was open for interment to anyone who could afford the fees . it appears on rocque 's map of london of 1746 , and elsewhere , as '' tindal 's burying ground '' . an inscription at the eastern entrance gate to the burial ground reads : '' this church-yard was inclosed with a brick wall at the sole charges of the city of london , in the mayoralty of sir john lawrence , , anno domini 1665 ; and afterwards the gates thereof were built and finished in the mayoralty of thomas bloodworth , knt . , anno domini , 1666 . '' the present gates and inscription date from 1868 , but the wording follows that of an original 17th-century inscription at the western entrance , now lost . the earliest recorded monumental inscription was that to '' grace , daughter of t . cloudesly , of leeds . february 1666 '' . william maitland , the history and survey of london from its foundation to the present time ( london , 1756 ) , p . 775 the earliest surviving monument is believed to be the headstone to theophilus gale : the inscription reads '' theophilus gale ma / born 1628 / died 1678 '' . in 1769 an act of parliament gave the corporation the right to continue the lease for 99 years . the city authorities continued to let the ground to their tenant as a burial ground ; in 1781 the corporation decided to take over management of the burial ground . so many historically important protestant nonconformists chose this as their place of interment that the 19th-century poet and writer robert southey characterised bunhill fields in 1830 as the ground '' which the dissenters regard as their campo santo '' . this term was applied to its '' daughter '' , abney park cemetery in stoke newington . closure as a burial ground . in 1852 the burial act was passed which enabled grounds to be closed once they became full . an order for closure for bunhill fields was made in december 1853 , and the final burial ( that of elizabeth howell oliver ) took place on 5 january 1854 . occasional interments continued to be permitted in existing vaults or graves : the final burial of this kind is believed to have been that of a mrs . gabriel of brixton in february 1860 . corporation of london 1991 , p . 8 . by this date approximately 123,000 interments had taken place in the burial ground . corporation of london 1991 , pp . 4 , 8 . two decades before , a group of city nonconformists led by george collison bought a site for a new landscaped alternative , at part of abney park in stoke newington . this was named abney park cemetery and opened in 1840 . all parts were available for the burial of any person , regardless of religious creed . it preceded brookwood cemetery as the prototype of many cemeteries to come nationally with '' no invidious dividing lines '' . it has a unique nondenominational chapel , designed by william hosking . community garden . upon closure of the bunhill fields burial ground , its future was uncertain as its lessee , the city of london corporation , was close to expiry of its lease , scheduled for christmas 1867 . ledger-lomas 2017 . to prevent the land from being redeveloped by the ecclesiastical commissioners ( who controlled the freehold ) at this expiry , the corporation formed the special bunhill fields burial ground committee in 1865 . this became formally known as the bunhill fields preservation committee . appointed by the corporation , it consisted on twelve advisors under the chairmanship of charles reed , fsa ( son of the congregational philanthropist andrew reed ) . he later rose to prominence as the first mp for hackney and chairman of the first school board for london before being knighted . along with his interest in making it into a parkland landscape , he was similarly interested in the wider educational and public benefits of abney park cemetery , of which he was a prominent director . to corroborate the committee 's work , the corporation obtained an act of parliament , the bunhill fields burial ground act 1867 , '' for the preservation of bunhill fields burial ground & nbsp ; . as an open space '' . the legislation enabled them to continue to maintain the site when reversion ( law ) to the ecclesiastical commissioners , provided it was laid out as a public open space with seating , gardens , and some of its most worthy monuments were restored . the improvements , which included the laying out of walks and paths , cost an estimated £3,500 . the new park was opened by the lord mayor , james clarke lawrence , on 14 october 1869 . the ground was severely damaged by german bombing during world war ii ; it is believed to have hosted an anti-aircraft gun during the blitz . in the 1950s , after some debate , the city ordered : to clear the northern third ( the projection ) of the site of most of its monuments to open it as a public garden ; and to preserve and protect the rest behind railings . legislation in 1960 gave the freehold to the city ( the corporation ) , which continues to maintain the grounds . landscaping was designed and overseen by the architect and landscape architect peter shepheard in 1964–65 . corporation of london 1991 , pp . 9–10 . in february 2012 , occupy london opened an encampment in the nw corner to replace their bank of ideas at sun street . bunyan , defoe and blake . the best-known monuments are those to the three literary and artistic figures , john bunyan , daniel defoe and william blake . their graves have long been sites of cultural pilgrimage : isabella holmes stated in 1896 that the '' most frequented paths '' in the burial ground were those leading to the monuments of bunyan and defoe . holmes 1896 , p . 135 . in their present form , all these monuments post-date the closure of the burial ground . their settings were further radically modified by the landscaping of 1964–65 , when a paved north–south '' broadwalk '' was created in the middle of the burial ground to display them—outside the railed-off areas , accessible to visitors , and cleared of other monuments . bunyan 's monument lies at the broadwalk 's southern end , and that to defoe at its northern end , while blake 's headstone was moved from the site of his grave and repositioned next to defoe , alongside the headstone to the lesser-known joseph swain ( d . 1796 ) . this arrangement survives , but in 2018 a second monument to blake was placed on the actual site of his grave . john bunyan . john bunyan , author of pilgrim 's progress , died in august 1688 . he was initially buried in the '' baptist corner '' at the back of the burial ground , on the understanding that his remains would be moved into the family vault of his friend john strudwick when that was next opened for a burial . there is no certain evidence as to when ( or even if ) this was done : the probability , however , is that it occurred when strudwick himself died in 1695 , and certainly bunyan 's name was inscribed on the side of the monument . the strudwick monument took the form of a large baroque stone chest . by the 19th century , this had fallen into decay , but in the period following the closure of the burial ground a public appeal for its restoration was launched under the presidency of the 7th earl of shaftesbury . this work was completed in may 1862 , and comprised a complete reconstruction of the monument , undertaken by the sculptor edgar george papworth senior ( 1809–1866 ) . although papworth retained the basic form of the tomb-chest , he added a recumbent effigy of bunyan to the top of it , and two relief panels to its sides depicting scenes from pilgrim 's progress . the monument was further restored in 1928 ( the tercentenary of bunyan 's birth ) , and again after world war ii ( following serious wartime damage to the effigy 's face ) . file : bunyan tomb 1849.jpg the monument to the strudwick family and john bunyan in its original form : an engraving of 1849 file : monument to john bunyan , central broadwalk 2013-09-04 14-21-58.jpg john bunyan 's monument as remodelled in 1862 . daniel defoe . daniel defoe , author of robinson crusoe , died in april 1731 and was buried in bunhill fields : his wife , mary , died in december 1732 and was laid to rest beside him . his daughter-in-law was also buried in the same grave . defoe died in poverty , and the grave was marked with a simple headstone . in the winter of 1857/8 – at a time when the burial ground was closed and neglected—the grave was struck by lightning and the headstone broken . in 1869 , james clarke , editor of the christian world children 's newspaper , launched an appeal for subscriptions to place a more suitable memorial on the grave . he encouraged his readers to make donations of sixpence each ; and to stimulate enthusiasm opened two lists , one for boys and one for girls , to encourage a spirit of competition between them . many adults also made donations . in the end , some 1,700 subscriptions raised a total of about £200 . a design for a marble obelisk ( or '' cleopatric pillar '' ) was commissioned from c . c . creeke ; and the sculptor samuel horner of bournemouth was commissioned to execute it . in late 1869 , when the foundations were being dug , skeletons were disinterred , and there was an unseemly rush for souvenirs by the crowd of onlookers : the police had to be called before calm was restored . the monument was unveiled at a ceremony attended by three of defoe 's great-granddaughters on 16 september 1870 . . william blake . william blake—painter , poet , printmaker and visionary—died in august 1827 and was buried in the northern part of the burial ground . his wife , catherine blake , died in october 1831 and was buried in a separate grave on the south side of the ground . by the 20th century , blake 's grave was in disrepair ; and in 1927 , for the centenary of his death and at a time when his reputation was on the rise , a new headstone was commissioned . as it had been decided to commemorate both william and catherine , despite the fact that the headstone would stand at some distance from catherine 's grave , the inscription was phrased as '' near by lie the remains of . '' . when bunhill fields was relandscaped in the 1960s , blake 's grave lay in the area that was to be cleared of monuments . the headstone was therefore moved approximately 20 & nbsp ; metres to its present location , next to the monument to daniel defoe . it was also rotated through 90° , so that it now faces south rather than west . joseph swain 's headstone was added to the grouping at the same time , although that faces west . flowers , coins and other tokens are regularly left by visitors to blake 's headstone . in 2006–07 , members of the group the friends of william blake established the original location of his grave , and proposed placing a new memorial there . in the form of a ledger stone , with lettering by lida cardozo kindersley , this was finally unveiled on 12 august 2018 by philip pullman , president of the blake society . file : finsbury bunhill blake 1.jpg 1927 headstone to william and catherine sophia blake file : bunhill blake 2018.jpg 2018 ledger stone on william blake 's grave . records . burial ground registers , from 1713 to 1854 , are held at the national archives at kew . references rg 4/3985–4001 . other records , including interment order books dating from 1789 to 1854 , and a list of the legible monument/headstone inscriptions in 1869 , are held at london metropolitan archives . baptist minister john rippon—who was himself buried at the site in 1836—made transcripts of its monumental inscriptions in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , some copied while '' laying on his side '' . in 1803 he issued a prospectus for a six-volume publication on bunhill fields , but this never came to fruition . the british library now holds 14 manuscript volumes of his transcripts ; a further six volumes are held in the college of arms . corporation of london 1991 , p . 11 . ledger-lomas 2017 , pp . 164–65 . . notable graves . notable burials include : . 17th century . thomas brand ( 1635–1691 ) , nonconformist minister and divine john bunyan ( 1628–1688 ) , author of the pilgrim 's progress thomas cole ( 1628–1697 ) , independent minister john faldo ( 1633–1690 ) , nonconformist minister and controversialist lt . gen . charles fleetwood ( c . 1618–1692 ) , fought on the roundhead side in the english civil war , served as lord deputy of ireland 1652–55 , and married bridget , eldest daughter of oliver cromwell theophilus gale ( 1628–1678 ) , nonconformist minister , educationalist and theologian thomas goodwin ( 1600–1680 ) , puritan theologian and preacher william hooke or hook ( 1600–1677 ) , puritan clergyman francis howell ( 1625–1679 ) , principal of jesus college , oxford , from 1657 to 1660 william jenkyn ( 1613–1685 ) , nonconformist minister , imprisoned during the interregnum hanserd knollys ( 1599–1691 ) , particular baptist minister nathaniel mather ( 1631–1697 ) , independent minister john owen ( 1616–1683 ) , puritan divine , theologian , academic administrator and statesman vavasor powell ( 1617–1670 ) , welsh puritan preacher and vicar of dartford , kent , parliamentary army chaplain , '' church planter '' sent out by the westminster assembly , and writer thomas rosewell ( 1630–1692 ) , nonconformist minister of rotherhithe john rowe ( 1626–1677 ) , nonconformist minister nathaniel vincent ( c . 1639–1697 ) , nonconformist minister . 18th century . james adair ( c . 1743–1798 ) , judge and serjeant-at-law stephen addington ( 1729–1796 ) , dissenting clergyman and teacher william aldridge ( 1737–1797 ) , nonconformist minister thomas amory ( 1701–1774 ) , dissenting minister , tutor and poet john asty ( c . 1672–1730 ) , dissenting clergyman joshua bayes ( 1671–1746 ) , nonconformist minister thomas bayes ( 1702–1761 ) , mathematician , clergyman , and friend of richard price william blackburn ( 1750–1790 ) , architect and surveyor thomas bradbury ( 1677–1759 ) , congregational minister john brine ( 1703–1765 ) , particular baptist minister thomas fowell buxton ( 1758–1795 ) , father of thomas folwell buxton , anti-slavery philanthropist samuel chandler ( 1693–1766 ) , nonconformist minister dr . john conder ( 1714–1781 ) , president of homerton college james coningham ( 1670–1716 ) , presbyterian divine and tutor thomas cotton ( 1653–1730 ) , dissenting minister cromwell family : two tombs commemorate various 18th-century members of this family , including hannah cromwell née hewling ( 1653–1732 ) , widow of major henry cromwell ( 1658–1711 ) , the grandson of oliver cromwell ; together with several of the couple 's children and grandchildren .
