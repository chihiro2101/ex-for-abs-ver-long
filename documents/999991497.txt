Human Potential Movement

roots . the emergence of hpm is linked to humanistic psychology . abraham maslow 's theory of self-actualization as the supreme expression of a human 's life has strongly influenced the movement . the institutes for the achievement of human potential , founded in 1955 by glenn doman and carl delacato , represent an early precusor to and influence on the human potential movement , with doman quoted as stating , '' every child born has , at the moment of birth , a greater potential intelligence than leonardo da vinci ever used . '' in the middle of the 1960s , george leonard did research across the united states on the subject of human potential for the magazine look . in his research , he interviewed 37 psychiatrists , brain researchers , and philosophers on the subject of human potential . he found that '' not one of them said we were using more than 10 % of our capacity . '' during the course of his research , leonard met michael murphy , a co-founder of the nascent esalen institute ( established in 1962 ) that at the time was running educational programs for adults on the topic of '' human potentialities '' . leonard and murphy became close friends and together '' put forth the idea that there should be a human potential movement . '' . social influence . hpm was regarded by some as being related to psychedelia such as hippies and summer of love . according to author andrew grant jackson , george harrison 's adoption of hindu philosophy and indian instrumentation in his songs with the beatles in the mid 1960s , together with the band 's highly publicised study of transcendental meditation , '' truly kick-started '' the human potential movement . as elizabeth puttick writes in the encyclopedia of new religions : the human potential movement ( hpm ) originated in the 1960s as a counter-cultural rebellion against mainstream psychology and organised religion . it is not in itself a religion , new or otherwise , but a psychological philosophy and framework , including a set of values that have made it one of the most significant and influential forces in modern western society . . authors and essayists . abraham maslow published his concept of a hierarchy of needs in a paper in 1943 . he argued that as people 's basic survival needs are met , so their desire to grow in mental and emotional dimensions increases . he also coined the term 'metamotivation ' to describe the motivation of people who go beyond the scope of the basic needs and strive for constant betterment . michael murphy and dick price founded the esalen institute in 1962 , primarily as a center for the study and development of human potential , and some people continue to regard esalen as the geographical center of the movement . aldous huxley gave lectures on the '' human potential '' at esalen in the early 1960s . his writings and lectures on the mystical dimensions of psychedelics and on what he called '' the perennial philosophy '' were foundational . moreover , his call for an institution that could teach the 'nonverbal humanities ' and the development of the 'human potentialities ' functioned as the working mission statement of early esalen . christopher lasch notes the impact of the human potential movement via the psychotherapy : '' the new therapies spawned by the human potential movement , according to peter marin , teach that '' the individual will is all powerful and totally determines one 's fate '' ; thus they intensify the '' isolation of the self '' . quoting george leonard , a magazine writer and editor who conducted research for an article on human potential , became an important early influence on esalen . leonard claims that he coined the phrase '' human potential movement '' during a brainstorming session with michael murphy , and popularized it in his 1972 book the transformation : a guide to the inevitable changes in mankind . leonard worked closely with the esalen institute afterwards , and in 2005 served as its president . human potential in europe . human potential concepts found in europe a growing interest thanks to training courses aimed at managers , graduate students , and unemployed , mainly funded by the european union in public development courses in the 1980s and 90s . . in these courses , modules such as communication skills , marketing , leadership and others in the '' soft skills '' area were embedded in the programs , and enabled the familiarization of most of the human potential concepts . a key role was played by '' eu strategic objective 3 , 4 , and 5 '' that explicitly included transversal key competences , such as learning to learn , a sense of initiative , entrepreneurship , and cultural awareness '' . official journal of the european union , council conclusions of 12 may 2009 on a strategic framework for european cooperation in education and training , 2009/c 119/02 these training programs , lasting as much as 900 to 1200 hours aimed at enhancing creativity and innovation , including entrepreneurship , and contained at all levels of education and training human potential concepts . one of the core concepts , maslow 's hierarchy of needs , a theory of psychological health predicated on fulfilling innate human needs , became popular in europe in the 80s mainly as a support to understanding consumer 's needs , and only after its use as a key marketing concept . philip kotler 's book '' marketing management '' was particularly influential in the 80 's in popularizing several human potential concepts that were '' embedded '' in the book kotler , philip ( 1984 ) , marketing management : analysis , planning , and control . published by prentice-hall , inc . , first edition 1984 . and entered in the working and management community . specifically targeted books on human potential have emerged in europe and can be found in the works of specific authors . for the '' anglo '' cultural area , the work of john whitmore whitmore , john ( 1992 ) , coaching for performance : growing human potential and purpose : the principles and practice of coaching and leadership , brealey publishing ( first edition ) contains a harsh critique of mainstream approaches to human potential as fast cures for self-improvement : '' contrary to the appealing claims of the one minute manager , there are no quick fixes in business '' . . for the '' latin '' cultural area , an early approach to human potential can be found in the work of maria montessori . montessori 's theory and philosophy of education were influenced by the work of jean marc gaspard itard , édouard séguin , friedrich fröbel , johann heinrich pestalozzi . her model emphasized autonomous learning , sensory exploration and training children in physical activities , empowering their senses and thoughts by exposure to sights , smells , and tactile experiences , and later included , problem solving . notable proponents . william james ( 1842–1910 ) , an early proponent gerald heard ( 1889–1971 ) fritz perls ( 1893–1970 ) aldous huxley ( 1894–1963 ) carl rogers ( 1902–1987 ) viktor frankl ( 1905–1997 ) viola spolin ( 1906–1994 ) joshua l . liebman ( 1907–1948 ) abraham maslow ( 1908–1970 ) alan watts ( 1915–1973 ) harvey jackins ( 1916–1999 ) chungliang al huang ( b . 1937 ) alexander everett ( 1921–2005 ) george leonard ( 1923–2010 ) moshé feldenkrais ( 1904–1984 ) stan dale ( 1929–2007 ) michael murphy ( b . 1930 ) werner erhard ( b . 1935 ) marilyn ferguson ( 1938–2008 ) william schutz ( 1925–2002 ) jean houston ( b . 1937 ) harold c . lyon , jr .
