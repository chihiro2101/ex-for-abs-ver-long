Republican Guard (France)

history . thumb the republican guard is the heir of the various bodies that preceded it in the course of french and parisian history and whose task was to honor and protect the high authorities of the state and the capital city : gardes françaises of the kings , consular and imperial guard of napoleon , etc . its name derives from the municipal guard of paris , established on 12 vendémiaire xi ( october 4 , 1802 ) by napoleon bonaparte . this unit distinguished itself in battles of historical significance , including danzig and friedland in 1807 , alcolea in 1808 and burgos in 1812 . in 1813 the municipal guard was dissolved following malet coup of 1812 of general malet and replaced by the imperial gendarmerie of paris and then , under the restoration , the royal guard of paris and the royal mounted police of paris . in 1830 , it was recreated , and again removed after the revolution of 1848 in favor of the civic guard ( which proved to be a transient institution ) . june 1848 saw the creation of the republican guard of paris , including an infantry regiment and a regiment of cavalry . on february 1 , 1849 , a napoleon iii decree made the guard a part of the french national gendarmerie . it received its insignia july 14 , 1880 . it did n't take part in the first world war as a unit but more than one third of its personnel were seconded to army regiments for the duration of the conflict . as a consequence , its flag and banner decorated with the knight 's cross of the legion of honour . during the second world war , it reported to the police headquarters and took the name of guard of paris . part of its staff rallied to general de gaulle and the guard was involved in the fighting alongside the ffi during the liberation of paris . from 1947 to 1954 , the republican guard took part in the indochina war by sending three '' legions of march '' which were mainly assigned to the training of allied indigenous troops and to the defense of certain places . the 3 legions , comprising a constant workforce of nearly 3,000 men , suffered heavy losses ( more than 600 dead and 1,500 wounded during the conflict ) , which earned it the croix de guerre toe . in 1954 , the republican guard split into two distinct branches , the mobile gendarmerie and the republican guard of paris . in 1978 , the guard took its current name of '' republican guard . '' president valéry giscard d'estaing gave it , on 11 november 1979 , its new insignia . michèle alliot-marie , minister of defence , said in october 2002 : '' the republican guard has a popularity that transcends borders , '' it contributes '' to the splendour of the french military and france .
