World Chess Championship

history . the concept of a world chess champion started to emerge in the first half of the 19th century , and the phrase '' world champion '' appeared in 1845 . from then onwards various players were acclaimed as world champions , but the first contest that was defined in advance as being for the world championship was the match between wilhelm steinitz and johannes zukertort in 1886 . until 1948 world championship contests were arranged privately between the players . as a result , the players also had to arrange the funding , in the form of stakes provided by enthusiasts who wished to bet on one of the players . in the early 20th century this was sometimes an obstacle that prevented or delayed challenges for the title . between 1888 and 1948 various difficulties that arose in match negotiations led players to try to define agreed rules for matches , including the frequency of matches , how much or how little say the champion had in the conditions for a title match and what the stakes and division of the purse should be . however these attempts were unsuccessful in practice , as the same issues continued to delay or prevent challenges . the first attempt by an external organization to manage the world championship was in 1887–1889 , but this experiment was not repeated . a system for managing regular contests for the title went into operation in 1948 , under the control of fide , and functioned quite smoothly until 1993 . however , in that year reigning champion kasparov and challenger short were so dissatisfied with fide 's arrangements for their match that they set up a breakaway organization . the split in the world championship continued until world chess championship 2006 ; however , the compromises required in order to achieve reunification had effects that lasted until the 2010 match . after reunification , fide retains the right to organize the world championship match , stabilizing to a two-year cycle . unofficial champions ( pre-1886 ) . image : louisdelabourdonnais.jpg thumb de la bourdonnais , the world 's strongest player from 1821 to his death in 1840 a series of players regarded as the strongest ( or at least the most famous ) in the world extends back hundreds of years , and these players are sometimes considered the world champions of their time . they include ruy lópez de segura around 1560 , paolo boi and leonardo da cutri around 1575 , alessandro salvio around 1600 , and gioachino greco around 1623 . in the 18th and early 19th centuries , french players dominated , with legall de kermeur ( 1730–1755 ) , françois-andré danican philidor ( 1755–1795 ) , alexandre deschapelles ( around 1800–1821 ) and louis-charles mahé de la bourdonnais ( 1821–1840 ) all widely regarded as the strongest players of their time . something resembling a world championship match was the la bourdonnais - mcdonnell chess matches in 1834 , in which la bourdonnais played a series of six matches – and 85 games – against the irishman alexander mcdonnell , with la bourdonnais winning a majority of the games . the idea of a chess world champion goes back at least to 1840 , when a columnist in fraser 's magazine wrote , '' will gaul continue the dynasty by placing a fourth frenchman on the throne of the world ? -- the three last chess chiefs having been successively philidor , deschapelles , and de la bourdonnais .

'' from morphy to fischer '' , israel horowitz , ( batsford , 1973 ) p.3 a letter quoted in the times on 16 november 1843 , but probably written before that , described the second staunton vs saint-amant match , played in paris in november–december 1843 , as being for '' the golden sceptre of philidor . '' the earliest recorded use of the term '' world champion '' was in 1845 , when howard staunton was described as '' the chess champion of england , or & nbsp ; . & nbsp ; the champion of the world '' . the earl of mexborough 's speech to the meeting of yorkshire chess clubs , as reported in the 1845 chess player 's chronicle ( with the cover date 1846 ) – the first known proposal that a contest should be defined in advance as being for recognition as the world 's best player was by ludwig bledow in a letter to tassilo von der lasa , written in 1846 and published in the deutsche schachzeitung in 1848 : '' . the winner of the battle in paris in 1843 , when staunton defeated st . amant should not be overly proud of his special position , since it is in trier that the crown will first be awarded . '' this was in reference to a proposed tournament to be held in trier , where von de lasa resided ; but bledow died in 1846 and the proposed tournament did not take place . similarly , the london 1851 chess tournament was described beforehand by some contemporary commentators as being for the world championship , but there is no mention afterwards in the tournament book by staunton . this can be viewed online at or downloaded as pdf from image : anderssen.jpeg thumb adolf anderssen is seen as the world 's leading player from 1851 , until he was defeated by paul morphy in 1858 . after morphy 's retirement from chess , anderssen was regarded as the strongest active player , especially after winning the london 1862 chess tournament . the 1851 london tournament was won by the german adolf anderssen , establishing him as the world 's leading player . '' from morphy to fischer '' , israel horowitz , ( batsford , 1973 ) p.4 anderssen has been described as the first modern chess master . '' the world 's great chess games '' , reuben fine , ( mckay , 1976 ) p.17 however , there is no evidence that he was widely acclaimed at the time as the world champion , although in 1893 henry bird retrospectively awarded the title to anderssen for his victory . section '' progress of chess '' in anderssen was himself decisively defeated in an 1858 match against the american paul morphy ( 7-2 , 2 draws ) , after which morphy was toasted across the chess-playing world as the world chess champion . morphy played matches against several leading players , crushing them all . 1858–59 paul morphy matches , mark weeks ' chess pages harper 's weekly ( 25 september 1858 ) and the american union ( 9 october 1858 ) hailed him as the world champion , but another article in harper 's weekly ( 9 october 1858 ; by c.h . stanley ) was uncertain about whether to describe the morphy–harrwitz match as being for the world championship . soon after , morphy offered pawn and move odds to anyone who played him . finding no takers , he abruptly retired from chess the following year , but many considered him the world champion until his death in 1884 . his sudden withdrawal from chess at his peak led to his being known as '' the pride and sorrow of chess '' . afterward morphy 's retirement from chess , anderssen was again regarded as the world 's strongest active player , a reputation he reinforced by winning the strong london 1862 chess tournament . from 1866 . in 1866 , wilhelm steinitz narrowly defeated anderssen in a match ( 8-6 , 0 draws ) . steinitz confirmed his standing as the world 's leading player by winning a match against johannes zukertort in 1872 ( 7-1 , 4 draws ) , winning the vienna 1873 chess tournament , and winning a match over joseph henry blackburne by a crushing 7-0 ( 0 draws ) in 1876 . however apart from the blackburne match , steinitz played no competitive chess from 1874 to 1882 . during that time , zukertort emerged as the world 's leading active player , winning the paris 1878 chess tournament . zukertort then won the london 1883 chess tournament by a convincing 3-point margin , ahead of nearly every leading player in the world , with steinitz finishing second . 1883 london tournament , mark weeks ' chess pages david hooper and kenneth whyld , the oxford companion to chess , oxford university press , 1992 ( 2nd edition ) , p.459 . this tournament established steinitz and zukertort as the best two players in the world , and led to a match between these two , the world chess championship 1886 , '' the centenary match , kasparov–karpov iii '' , raymond keene and david goodman , batsford 1986 , p.9 won by steinitz . there is some debate over whether to date steinitz ' reign as world champion from his win over anderssen in 1866 , or from his win over zukertort in 1886 . the 1886 match was clearly agreed to be for the world championship , j.i . minchin , the editor of the tournament book , wrote , '' dr . zukertort at present holds the honoured post of champion , but only a match can settle the position of these rival monarchs of the chess realm . '' j.i . minchin ( editor ) , games played in the london international chess tournament , 1883 , british chess magazine , 1973 ( reprint ) , p.100 . but there is no indication that steinitz was regarded as the defending champion . '' from morphy to fischer '' , israel horowitz , ( batsford , 1973 ) , p.24 there is also no known evidence of steinitz being called world champion after defeating anderssen in 1866 . it has been suggested that steinitz could not make such a claim while morphy was alive ( morphy died in 1884 ) . there are a number of references to steinitz as world champion in the 1870s , the earliest being after the first zukertort match in 1872 . later , in 1879 , it was argued that zukertort was world champion , since morphy and steinitz were not active . but later in his career , at least from 1887 , steinitz dated his reign from this 1866 match ; early uses of 'world chess champion ' , edward g . winter , 2007 and early sources such as the new york times in 1894 , and emanuel lasker in 1908 , do the same ; as did reuben fine in 1952 . many recent commentators divide steinitz 's reign into an '' unofficial '' one from 1866 to 1886 , and an '' official '' one after 1886 . by this reckoning , the first world championship match was in 1886 , and steinitz was the first official world chess champion . official champions before fide ( 1886–1946 ) . . the reign of wilhelm steinitz ( 1886-1894 ) . image : wilhelm steinitz2.jpg thumb wilhelm steinitz dominated chess from 1866 to 1894 . some commentators date his time as world champion from 1866 ; others from 1886 . following the steinitz-zukertort match , a tradition continued of the world championship being decided by a match between the reigning champion , and a challenger : if a player thought he was strong enough , he ( or his friends ) would find financial backing for a match purse and challenge the reigning world champion . if he won , he would become the new champion . steinitz successfully defended his world title against mikhail chigorin in 1889 , isidor gunsberg in 1891 , and chigorin again in 1892 . in 1887 the american chess congress started work on drawing up regulations for the future conduct of world championship contests . steinitz supported this endeavor , as he thought he was becoming too old to remain world champion . the proposal evolved through many forms ( as steinitz pointed out , such a project had never been undertaken before ) , and resulted in the 1889 tournament in new york to select a challenger for steinitz , rather like the more recent candidates tournaments . the tournament was duly played , but the outcome was not quite as planned : chigorin and max weiss tied for first place ; their play-off resulted in four draws ; and neither wanted to play a match against steinitz – chigorin had just lost to him , and weiss wanted to get back to his work for the rothschild bank . the third prizewinner isidor gunsberg was prepared to play steinitz for the title in new york , so this match was played in 1890-1891 and was won by steinitz . based on the experiment was not repeated , and steinitz ' later matches were private arrangements between the players . two young strong players emerged in late 1880s and early 1890s : siegbert tarrasch and emanuel lasker . tarrasch had the better tournament results at the time , but it was lasker who was able to raise the money to challenge steinitz . '' from morphy to fischer '' , israel horowitz , ( batsford , 1973 ) 39 lasker won the 1894 match and succeeded steinitz as world champion . lasker ( 1894–1921 ) . lasker was the first champion after steinitz ; although he did not defend his title in 1897–1906 or 1911–1920 , he did string together an impressive run of tournament victories and dominated his opponents . his success was largely due to the fact that he was an excellent practical player . in difficult or objectively lost positions he would complicate matters and use his extraordinary tactical abilities to save the game . he held the title from 1894 to 1921 , the longest reign ( 27 years ) of any champion . in that period he defended the title successfully in one-sided matches against steinitz , frank marshall , siegbert tarrasch and dawid janowski , and was only seriously threatened in a tied 1910 match against carl schlechter . lasker 's negotiations for title matches from 1911 onwards were extremely controversial . in 1911 he received a challenge for a world title match against josé raúl capablanca and , in addition to making severe financial demands , proposed some novel conditions : the match should be considered drawn if neither player finished with a two-game lead ; and it should have a maximum of 30 games , but finish if either player won six games and had a two-game lead ( previous matches had been won by the first to win a certain number of games , usually 10 ; in theory such a match might go on for ever ) . capablanca objected to the two-game lead clause ; lasker took offence at the terms in which capablanca criticized the two-game lead condition and broke off negotiations . this cites : a report of lasker 's concerns about the location and duration of the match , in ; capablanca 's letter of 20 december 1911 to lasker , stating his objections to lasker 's proposal ; lasker 's letter to capablanca , breaking off negotiations ; lasker 's letter of 27 april 1921 to alberto ponce of the havana chess club , proposing to resign the 1921 match ; and ponce 's reply , accepting the resignation . further controversy arose when , in 1912 , lasker 's terms for a proposed match with akiba rubinstein included a clause that , if lasker should resign the title after a date had been set for the match , rubinstein should become world champion ( american chess bulletin , october 1913 ) . when he resumed negotiations with capablanca after world war i , lasker insisted on a similar clause that if lasker should resign the title after a date had been set for the match , capablanca should become world champion . on 27 june 1920 lasker abdicated in favor of capablanca because of public criticisms of the terms for the match , naming capablanca as his successor ( american chess bulletin , july august 1920 ) . some commentators questioned lasker 's right to name his successor ( british chess magazine , august 1920 ; rochester democrat and chronicle ) ; amos burn raised the same objection but welcomed lasker 's resignation of the title ( the field , 3 july 1920 ) . capablanca argued that , if the champion abdicated , the title must go to the challenger as any other arrangement would be unfair to the challenger ( british chess magazine , october 1922 ) . nonetheless lasker agreed to play a match against capablanca in 1921 , announcing that , if he won , he would resign the title so that younger masters could compete for it ( '' dr lasker and the championship '' in american chess bulletin , september–october 1920 ) . capablanca won their 1921 match easily . . capablanca , alekhine and euwe ( 1921–1946 ) . after the breakdown of his first attempt to negotiate a title match against lasker ( 1911 ) , capablanca drafted rules for the conduct of future challenges , which were agreed by the other top players at the 1914 saint petersburg tournament , including lasker , and approved at the mannheim congress later that year . the main points were : the champion must be prepared to defend his title once a year ; the match should be won by whichever player first won six or eight games ( the champion had the right to choose ) ; and the stake should be at least £1,000 ( about £ . see also . list of world chess championships candidates tournament chess olympiad comparison of top chess players throughout history list of world championships in mind sports my great predecessors fast chess women 's world chess championship world junior chess championship world chess solving championship world correspondence chess championship chess world cup fide grand prix
