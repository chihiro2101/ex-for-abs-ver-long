later work . after leaving bowie 's entourage after the '' farewell concert '' in 1973 , ronson released three solo albums . his solo debut slaughter on 10th avenue , featured a version of elvis presley 's '' love me tender '' , as well as ronson 's most famous solo track , '' only after dark '' . in addition , his sister , margaret ( maggi ) ronson , provided the backing vocals for the set . between this and the 1975 follow-up , ronson had a short-lived stint with mott the hoople . he then became a long-time collaborator with mott 's former leader ian hunter , commencing with the album ian hunter ( uk no . 21 ) and featuring the uk singles chart no . 14 hit '' once bitten , twice shy '' , including a spell touring as the hunter ronson band . in 1980 , the live album welcome to the club was released , including a couple of ronson contributions , although it also contained a few studio-based tracks – one of which was a hunter/ronson composition . in 1974 , ronson secured the no . 2 spot from a reader 's poll in creem magazine as the best guitarist that year ( with jimmy page taking first place ) , and eric clapton in third place after ronson . ronson contributed guitar to the title track of the 1976 david cassidy release getting it in the street . on 11 february 1977 the single '' billy porter '' ( b/w '' seven days '' ) was released on rca victor records , but did not chart . roger daltrey employed ronson 's guitar on his 1977 solo release one of the boys . in 1979 , ronson and hunter produced and played on the ellen foley debut album , night out , with '' we belong to the night '' and the hit single '' what 's a matter baby '' . he also played guitar on roger c reale ’ s “ reptiles in motion ” album recorded in 1979 and only released in 2019 after the master tapes were acquired from the family of the original rights owners . the label big sound , based in connecticut , had gone bust and the album remained unreleased for forty years . in 1982 , ronson worked with john mellencamp on his american fool album , and in particular the song '' jack & diane '' : '' i owe mick ronson the hit song 'jack & diane ' . mick was very instrumental in helping me arrange that song , as i 'd thrown it on the junk heap . ronson came down and played on three or four tracks and worked on the american fool record for four or five weeks . all of a sudden , for 'jack & diane ' , mick said 'johnny , you should put baby rattles on there . ' i thought , 'what the fuck does put baby rattles on the record mean ? so he put the percussion on there and then he sang the part 'let it rock , let it roll ' as a choir-ish-type thing , which had never occurred to me . and that is the part everybody remembers on the song . it was ronson 's idea . '' ( john mellencamp , classic rock magazine , january 2008 , p.61 ) both '' jack & diane '' and american fool topped their respective us billboard charts . ronson was recruited to midge ure 's band for ure 's gift tour in 1985 . after weeks of rehearsal , ronson left the band due to financial disagreements and was replaced by zal cleminson . in 1990 , ronson again collaborated with hunter on the album yui orta , this time getting joint credit , as '' hunter/ronson '' . one of the backing singers on the album was carola westerlund . while in sweden ronson wrote and produced three new songs with estelle millburne and westerlund as ec2 : '' i 'm so sorry '' / '' kiss me '' ( 1990 ) , then a second single as ecii : '' passion '' with a b-side cover of j . kilette and k . brown 's '' i 'm forever blowing bubbles '' . in 1993 , he again appeared on a bowie album , black tie white noise , playing on the track '' i feel free '' , originally recorded by cream . ronson and bowie had already covered this track live 20 years earlier , whilst touring as ziggy stardust and the spiders from mars . he also played lead guitar on the morrissey-penned '' i know it 's gon na happen someday '' . his second and third solo albums were play do n't worry in 1975 , and heaven and hull in 1994 . the latter set was only partly completed at the time of ronson 's death , and was released posthumously . artists involved with the album included bowie , john mellencamp , joe elliott , ian hunter , chrissie hynde , and martin chambers . besides bowie and hunter , ronson went on to work as a musician , songwriter and record producer with many other acts . he did not restrict his influence behind the recording desk to just established acts . his production work appears on albums by more obscure artists , such as payolas , phil rambow and los illegals , the mundanes and italian band modà . ronson produced the visible targets , a seattle , washington-based group , on their 1983 five track ep , '' autistic savant '' . in 1985 he produced and played on the four song ep '' stillwell avenue '' with the nyc based band xdavis . ronson was also a member of bob dylan 's '' rolling thunder revue '' live band , and can be seen both on and off-stage in the film of the tour . he made a connection with roger mcguinn during this time , which led to his producing and contributing guitar and arrangements to mcguinn 's 1976 solo album cardiff rose . in 1982 , he participated on lead guitar in a short-lived band with hilly michaels on drums and les fradkin on bass guitar . one of their recordings from this group , '' spare change '' , appeared on the fradkin 's 2006 album , goin ' back . in 1987 , ronson made an appearance on a record by the toll . ronson played lead on the band 's song , '' stand in winter '' , from the album the price of progression . in 1991 , ronson produced the swedish cult band the leather nun 's album , nun permanent , adding backing vocals and guitar overdubs on several tracks . at the end of the production , during a short visit to his sister in london , ronson was diagnosed with cancer . in 1992 he produced morrissey 's album , your arsenal . the same year , ronson 's final high-profile live performance was his appearance at the freddie mercury tribute concert . he played on '' all the young dudes '' with bowie and hunter ;
