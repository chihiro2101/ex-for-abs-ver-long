Bobby Fuller

early life . born in baytown , texas , fuller was born in the middle of three boys , having a maternal older half-brother , jack , and a younger brother , randy . fuller moved as a small child to salt lake city , where he remained until 1956 , when he and his family moved to el paso , texas . his father got a job at el paso natural gas at that time . it was the same year that elvis presley became popular , and bobby fuller became mesmerized by the new rock and roll star . fuller soon adopted the style of fellow texan buddy holly , fronting a four-man combo and often using original material . career . during the early 1960s , he played in clubs and bars in el paso , and he recorded on independent record labels in texas with a constantly changing line-up . the only constant band members were fuller and his younger brother , randy fuller ( born on january 29 , 1944 , in hobbs , new mexico ) on bass . most of these independent releases ( except two songs recorded at the studio of norman petty in clovis ) , and an excursion to yucca records , also in new mexico , were recorded in the fullers ' own home studio , with fuller acting as the producer . he even built a primitive echo chamber in the back yard . the quality of the recordings , using a couple of microphones and a mixing board purchased from a local radio station , was so impressive that he offered the use of his '' studio '' to local acts for free so he could hone his production skills . fuller moved to los angeles in 1964 with his band the bobby fuller four and was signed to mustang records by producer bob keane , who was noted for discovering ritchie valens and producing many surf music groups . by this time , the group consisted of fuller and his brother randy on vocals/guitar and bass respectively , jim reese on guitar and dewayne quirico on drums . this lineup recorded '' i fought the law '' . ( there are actually two versions of '' i fought the law '' by fuller , the original hit that was released as a 45-rpm single and the re-recording that was issued on an album . the arrangements are identical , but the vocals by fuller are slightly different . ) at a time when the british invasion and folk rock were the dominant genres in rock , fuller stuck to buddy holly 's style of classic rock and roll with tex mex flourishes . his recordings , both covers and originals , also reveal the influences of eddie cochran , the beatles , elvis presley , little richard , and the everly brothers , as well as surf music . less well known was fuller 's ability to emulate the reverb-laden surf guitar of dick dale and the ventures . his first top 40 hit was the self-penned '' let her dance '' . his second hit , '' i fought the law '' , peaked at 9 on the billboard hot 100 on march 12–19 , 1966 . the song was originally written and recorded by sonny curtis , who became a member of buddy holly 's former group the crickets after holly 's death . the group 's third top 40 single was a cover of holly 's '' love 's made a fool of you . '' . death . within months of '' i fought the law '' becoming a top 10 hit , fuller was found dead in an automobile parked outside his hollywood apartment . the los angeles deputy medical examiner , jerry nelson , performed the autopsy . according to dean kuipers : '' the report states that bobby 's face , chest , and side were covered in 'petechia , ' probably caused by gasoline vapors and the summer heat . he found no bruises , no broken bones , no cuts . no evidence of beating . '' kuipers further explains that boxes for '' accident '' and '' suicide '' were checked , but next to the boxes were question marks . despite the official cause of death , some commentators believe fuller was murdered . erik greene , a relative of sam cooke , has cited similarities in the deaths of cooke and fuller . fuller bandmate jim reese suspected that charles manson played a role in fuller 's death but never provided credible evidence . besides , manson could not possibly have been involved because he was in prison from 1961 to 1967 . a sensationalist crime website has speculated that the los angeles police department may have been involved because of fuller 's connection to a mafia-related woman . fuller was buried at forest lawn memorial park in the hollywood hills of los angeles . his death was profiled in a segment of unsolved mysteries . his death was also explored in the may 11 , 2015 episode of the npr program all things considered . the program references the book i fought the law : the life and strange death of bobby fuller , by miriam linna , with contributions by randy fuller . sometime after the unsolved mysteries segment in question initially aired , the cause of fuller 's death was officially changed from '' suicide '' to '' accident . '' . in popular culture . in 1996 , atlanta indie rock band the rock a teens released their song '' who killed bobby fuller '' on their debut album , and the indie rock band metric referenced both bobby fuller 's name and '' i fought the law '' on their 2006 single '' monster hospital '' , , as did lou reed on the track '' dirt '' , from his 1978 album street hassle . in 2015 , producer and artist terry manning released a tribute album to his friend and mentor bobby fuller entitled west texas skyline . in 2017 , chuck prophet released the critically lauded album bobby fuller died for your sins . the clash recorded a cover version of '' i fought the law '' on an ep and became a standard of their live shows . it was also covered by the dead kennedys . phil seymour 's recording of '' let her dance '' was a hit single in various cities in the u.s . in 1981 and 1982 . discography . studio albums . krla king of the wheels ( mustang m-900 mono / ms-900 stereo , 1965 ) 5 a1 .
