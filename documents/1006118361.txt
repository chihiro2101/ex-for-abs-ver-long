Mount Vernon

washington 's tomb . on december 12 , 1799 , washington spent several hours riding over the plantation , in snow , hail and freezing rain . he ate his supper later that evening without changing from his wet clothes . the following day , he awoke with a severe sore throat ( either quinsy or acute epiglottitis ) and became increasingly hoarse as the day progressed . all the available medical treatments failed to improve his condition , and he died at mount vernon at around 10 pm on december 14 , 1799 , aged 67 . on december 18 , a funeral was held at mount vernon , where his body was interred . congress passed a joint resolution to construct a marble monument in the united states capitol for his body , an initiative supported by martha . in december 1800 , the united states house passed an appropriations bill for 200,000 to build the mausoleum , which was to be a pyramid with a base square . southerners who wanted his body to remain at mount vernon defeated the measure . in accordance with his will , washington was entombed in a family crypt he had built upon first inheriting the estate . it was in disrepair by 1799 , so washington 's will also requested that a new , larger tomb be built . this was not executed until 1831 , the centennial of his birth . the need for a new tomb was confirmed when an unsuccessful attempt was made to steal his skull . a joint congressional committee in early 1832 debated the removal of washington 's body from mount vernon to a crypt in the capitol , built by charles bulfinch in the 1820s . southern opposition was intense , exacerbated by an ever-growing rift between north and south . congressman wiley thompson of georgia expressed the southerners ' fears when he said : in 1831 , the bodies of george and martha washington , along with other members of the family , were moved from the old crypt to the new family tomb . on october 7 , 1837 , washington 's remains , encased in a lead inner casket , were transferred from the closed tomb to a sarcophagus presented by john struthers of philadelphia . it was placed on the right side of the gateway to the tomb . a similar structure was provided for martha 's remains , which was placed on the left . other members of the washington family are interred in an inner vault , behind the vestibule containing the sarcophagi . preservation , legacy and tourism . following martha washington 's death in 1802 , george washington 's will was carried out in accordance with the terms of his bequests . the largest part of his estate , which included both his papers and mount vernon , passed to his nephew , bushrod washington , an associate justice of the supreme court of the united states .

( 5 ) . the younger washington and his wife then moved to mount vernon . bushrod washington did not inherit much cash and was unable to support the upkeep of the estate 's mansion on the proceeds from the property and his supreme court salary . he sold some of his own slaves to gain working capital .

( 2 ) however , the farms ' low revenues left him short , and he was unable to adequately maintain the mansion . following bushrod washington 's death in 1829 , ownership of the plantation passed to george washington 's grandnephew , john augustine washington ii . after he died in 1832 , his wife , jane charlotte inherited the estate , and her son began managing it . upon her death in 1855 , john augustine washington iii inherited the property . as his funds dwindled and the wear and tear of hundreds of visitors began to take its toll , washington could do little to maintain the mansion and its surroundings . washington suggested to the united states congress that the federal government purchase the mansion . however , congress paid little interest to washington 's offer , as the legislature was focusing on the conditions that shortly led to the american civil war . washington then traveled to richmond , where he was equally unsuccessful in appealing to the virginia general assembly for the state to purchase the mansion . the mansion 's decline continued . in 1858 , washington sold the mansion and a portion of the estate 's land to the mount vernon ladies ' association , which was under the leadership of ann pamela cunningham . the association paid the final installment of the purchase price of 200,000 ( 6.3 million in 2020 dollars ) in december 1859 , taking possession in february 1860 . the estate first opened to the public during that year . the estate served as a neutral ground for both sides during the civil war , although fighting raged across the nearby countryside . troops from both the union and the confederacy toured the building . the two women caretakers asked that the soldiers leave their arms behind and either change to civilian clothes or at least cover their uniforms . they usually did as asked . harrison howell dodge became the third resident superintendent in 1885 . during his 52 years ' overseeing the estate , he doubled the facility 's acreage , improved the grounds , and added many historic artifacts to the collections . dodge reviewed george washington 's writings about the estate , visited other colonial-era gardens , and traveled to england to see gardens dating from the georgian period . using that knowledge , dodge oversaw the restoration of the site and put in place a number of improvements that washington had planned but had never implemented . charles wall was assistant superintendent from 1929 to 1937 , then resident superintendent for 39 years . he oversaw restoration of the house and planted greenery consistent with what was used in the 18th century . in 1974 , a campaign he organized was successful in preserving as parkland areas in maryland across the potomac river from mount vernon , as part of an effort to retain the bucolic vista from the house . his office was the same one used in the 18th century by washington . steamboats began to carry tourists to the mount vernon estate in 1878 . in 1892 , the washington , alexandria and mount vernon electric railway opened , providing electric tram service between alexandria and the estate . 1894 topographic map of the city of alexandria , alexandria county , and eastern fairfax county , showing the route of the washington , alexandria and mount vernon railway ( unlabled ) between the city of alexandria and mount vernon : the electric railway and its successors carried tourists and others between washington , d.c . , and mount vernon from 1896 to 1932 , when the federal government acquired part of its route on which to construct the george washington memorial parkway .
