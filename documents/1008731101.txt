Brigade of Gurkhas

history . during the war in nepal in 1814 , in which the british attempted to annex nepal into the empire , army officers were impressed by the tenacity of the gurkha soldiers and encouraged them to volunteer for the east india company . gurkhas served as troops of the company in the pindaree war of 1817 , in bharatpur , nepal in 1826 , and the first and second sikh wars in 1846 and 1848 . during the sepoy mutiny in 1857 , the gurkha regiments remained loyal to the british , and became part of the british indian army on its formation . the 2nd gurkha rifles ( the sirmoor rifles ) and the 60th rifles famously defended hindu rao 's house . during the malayan emergency in the late 1940s , gurkhas fought as jungle soldiers as they had done in burma . the training depot brigade of gurkhas was established on 15 august 1951 at sungai petani , kedah , malaya . after the conflict ended , the gurkhas were transferred to hong kong , where they carried out security duties . the troops patrolled the border checking for illegal immigrants entering the territory , most crucially during the turbulence of the cultural revolution . they were deployed to contain crowds during the hong kong 1966 riots . after indian independence and partition in 1947 , under the tripartite agreement , six gurkha regiments joined the post-independence indian army . four gurkha regiments , the 2nd , 6th , 7th ,

regiments ( the gurkha military police having been disbanded in 1965 ) were reduced to squadron strength . on 1 july 1997 , the british government handover of hong kong to the people 's republic of china , which led to the elimination of the local british garrison . gurkha hq and recruit training were moved to the uk . the royal gurkha rifles took part in operations in kosovo in 1999 , in un peacekeeping operations in east timor in 2000 and in sierra leone later that year . in september 2008 the high court in london ruled that the british government must issue clear guidance on the criteria against which gurkhas may be considered for settlement rights in the uk . on 21 may 2009 , and following a lengthy gurkha justice campaign , the british home secretary , jacqui smith ,

islands , sir lawrence freedman ) , sir john nott , as secretary of state for defence , expressed the british government 's concern that the gurkhas could not be sent with the task force to falkland war because it might upset the non-aligned members of the fragile coalition of support that the british had built in the united nations . the then-chief of defence staff sir edwin bramall , a former officer in the 2nd gurkhas like nott , said that the gurkhas were needed for sound military reasons ( as a constituent part of 5th infantry brigade ) and if they were not deployed then there would always be a political reason not to deploy gurkhas in future conflicts . so he requested that nott argue the case in government for deploying them against the advice of the foreign office . nott agreed to do so , commenting that the gurkhas '' would be mortified if we spoilt their chances of going '' . lawrence freedman , ( 2005 ) . the official history of the falklands campaign , volume 2 :
