Roky Erickson

mental illness and legal problems . in 1968 , while performing at hemisfair , erickson began speaking gibberish . he was soon diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and sent to a houston psychiatric hospital , where he involuntarily received electroconvulsive therapy . the elevators were vocal proponents of marijuana and psychedelic drug use , and were subject to extra attention from law enforcement agencies . in 1969 , erickson was arrested for possession of a single marijuana joint in austin . facing a potential ten-year incarceration , erickson pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to avoid prison . he was first sent to the austin state hospital . after several escapes , he was sent to the rusk state hospital in rusk , texas , where he was subjected to more electroconvulsive therapy and thorazine treatments , ultimately remaining in custody until 1972 . during his time at rusk , he continued writing songs and poetry . family and friends managed to smuggle out some of these poems and , in 1972 , self published the book openers , intending to use the proceeds to hire a lawyer . ( various sources claim approximately 1,000 copies of openers were printed ; how many copies were actually sold remains unknown . ) six tracks from the 1999 erickson collection never say goodbye were also recorded during his time at rusk . alien years . in 1974 , after having been released from the state hospital , erickson formed a new band which he called '' bleib alien , '' bleib being an anagram of bible and/or german for '' remain , '' and '' alien '' being a pun on the german word allein ( '' alone '' ) – the phrase in german , therefore , being '' remain alone . '' his new band exchanged the psychedelic sounds of the 13th floor elevators for a more hard rock sound that featured lyrics on old horror film and science fiction themes . '' two headed dog ( red temple prayer ) '' ( produced by the sir douglas quintet 's doug sahm and inspired by vladimir demikhov 's 1950s head transplant experiments ) was released as a single . the new band was renamed roky erickson and the aliens . in 1979 , after playing with the reversible cords on may day at raul 's , erickson recorded 15 new songs with producer stu cook , former bass player of creedence clearwater revival . these efforts were released in two '' overlapping '' lps – roky erickson and the aliens ( cbs uk , 1980 ) and the evil one ( 415 records , 1981 ) . cook played bass on two tracks , '' sputnik '' and '' bloody hammer . '' roky performed with the nervebreakers as his backup band at the palladium in dallas in july 1979 . a recording was issued on the french label new rose and was recently re-issued elsewhere . the austin-based band the explosives served as roky 's most frequent back-up band during the early raul 's club era , between 1978 and the early 1980s . billed as roky erickson and the explosives , they were regulars at raul 's , the continental club , and other austin venues . it was this incarnation that contributed two live tracks to the first live at raul 's lp , released in 1980 , with other raul 's top bands : the skunks , terminal mind , the next , standing waves , and the explosives ( without roky erickson ) . the roky erickson tracks ( '' red temple prayer '' and '' do n't shake me lucifer '' ) were not included on the initial release for contractual reasons , but were included on a later release . interview with fred krc , june 17 , 2015 ; club calendars of raul 's , continental club and soap creek saloon , 1978—1982 in 1982 , erickson asserted that a martian had inhabited his body . he came to feel that , due to his being alien , human beings were attacking him psychically . a concerned friend enlisted a notary public to witness an official statement by erickson that he was an alien ; he hoped by declaring so publicly he would be in line with any '' international laws '' he might have been breaking . erickson claimed the attacks then indeed stopped . creative decline and renewed interest . beginning in the 1980s , erickson developed a years-long obsession with the mail , often spending hours poring over random junk mail he received and writing to solicitors and celebrities ( dead or living ) . he was arrested in 1989 on charges of mail theft for gathering up mail from the mailboxes of neighbors who had moved ; erickson collected the mail and taped it to the walls of his bedroom . the charges were dropped when erickson insisted that he had never opened any of the mail . several live albums of his older material have been released since then , and in 1990 sire records/warner bros . records released a tribute album , where the pyramid meets the eye : a tribute to roky erickson , produced by wb executive bill bentley . it featured versions of erickson 's songs performed by the jesus and mary chain , r.e.m . , zz top , poi dog pondering , julian cope , butthole surfers , bongwater , john wesley harding , doug sahm , and primal scream , among others . according to the liner notes , the title of the album came from a remark erickson made to a friend who asked him to define psychedelic music , to which erickson reportedly replied '' it 's where the pyramid meets the eye , man , '' an apparent reference to the eye of providence and the great seal of the united states . return to music and later life . image : roky erickson and the explosives at bumbershoot 2007 01.jpg thumb roky erickson and the explosives at bumbershoot festival ( 2007 ) . thumb thumb in 1995 , erickson released all that may do my rhyme on butthole surfers drummer king coffey 's label trance syndicate records . produced by texas tornados

erickson 's lyrics . published by henry rollins 's 2.13.61 publications , it was compiled and edited by casey monahan with assistance from rollins and erickson 's youngest brother sumner erickson , a classical tuba player . sumner was granted legal custody of roky in 2001 , and established a legal trust to aid his brother . as a result , roky received some of the most effective medical and legal aid of his life , the latter useful in helping sort out the complicated tangle of contracts that had reduced royalties to all but nothing for his recorded works . he also started taking medication to better manage his schizophrenia . a documentary film on the life of roky erickson titled you 're gon na miss me was made by director keven mcalester and screened at the 2005 sxsw film festival . in

perform songs from the 13th floor elevators catalog that had not been performed in decades with fellow austinites the black angels as his backing band . after months of practices and time recording in an austin studio , they performed a show in dallas followed by a west coast tour . the black angels played a regular set and then backed erickson as his rhythm section , playing 13th floor elevators songs as well as songs from erickson 's solo albums . on april 20 , 2010 , erickson released true love cast out all evil , his first album of new material in 14 years . okkervil river serves as
