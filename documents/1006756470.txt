John Taylor (bass guitarist)

biography . born in solihull , which was then in warwickshire , john taylor grew up in nearby hollywood , worcestershire , england . as a child , he attended our lady of the wayside catholic school and the abbey high school , in redditch , wore glasses ( due to severe myopia , over -10 dioptres ) , enjoyed james bond movies and was interested in the hobby of wargaming with hand-painted model soldiers . in his early teen years , he discovered music , choosing roxy music as his favourite band , and before long was collecting records and teaching himself to play the piano . his first band was called shock treatment . 1978–1997 : duran duran and power station . in 1978 , taylor and school friend nick rhodes formed duran duran with stephen duffy while attending the school of foundation studies & experimental workshop birmingham polytechnic ( now birmingham city university ) . soon after taylor underwent an '' ugly duckling '' transformation—ditching the glasses for contact lenses , adopting the ruffles and sashes of the fashion that would become known as the new romantic style , and learning to wear eyeliner and lipstick . he stopped using the name '' nigel '' , and has been known throughout his professional career as john taylor . taylor played guitar when duran duran was founded , but switched to bass guitar after discovering the funky rhythms of chic , and learned to enjoy playing in the rhythm section with duran 's newly recruited drummer roger taylor . he has frequently cited chic 's bernard edwards and the clash 's paul simonon as his strongest influences , in addition to paul mccartney , james jamerson , and roxy music players graham simpson and john porter . duran duran released their first album in 1981 , and went on to worldwide success in the early 1980s . in 1985 , after recording the theme song to the bond movie a view to a kill , duran duran split into two side projects . john taylor and duran duran guitarist andy taylor joined forces with former chic drummer tony thompson and robert palmer , who earlier met at duran duran 's charity concert at aston villa football ground 1983 , to form the band the power station . with the guidance of producer bernard edwards , they released one album , the power station , which produced the hit singles '' some like it hot '' and the t.rex cover song '' get it on ( t . rex song ) '' . that year , taylor also launched his first solo effort , recording the single '' i do what i do . '' for the soundtrack to the movie 9½ weeks starring kim basinger . he also wrote some instrumental music for the movie 's score with collaborator jonathan elias . when andy taylor and roger taylor left the band , the three remaining members reformed duran duran for the 1986 notorious album , and continued to record and tour throughout the 1990s with new guitarist warren cuccurullo . on 24 december 1991 , taylor married 19-year-old amanda de cadenet , who was already pregnant with his daughter atlanta ( born 31 march 1992 ) . he moved from england to los angeles , california to help further his wife 's acting career , as well as to escape constant attention from the british tabloids . taylor 's marriage declined even as duran duran 's star rose with the success of 1993 's duran duran , also known as the wedding album . in late 1994 , taylor sought treatment for his substance abuse , and has remained sober since . he and de cadenet separated in may 1995 . duran duran 's success rapidly waned with the widely derided 1995 covers album thank you . following that album 's supporting tour , duran duran spent part of the summer of 1995 in london working on the album medazzaland . concurrently , taylor devoted time to the side project neurotic outsiders , recording and touring with that band from the end of 1995 through the start of 1996 . 1997–2001 : solo music career . in january 1997 , taylor announced at a duran duran fan convention that he was leaving the band .
