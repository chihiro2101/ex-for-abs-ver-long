charles kenzie steele , vice president ; abernathy , financial secretary-treasurer ; t . j . jemison , secretary ; i . m . augustine , general counsel . on august 8 , 1957 , the southern leadership conference held its first convention , in montgomery , alabama . at that time , they changed the conference 's name for the final time to the southern christian leadership conference , and decided upon starting up voter registration drives for black people across the south . on may 20 , 1961 , the freedom riders stopped in montgomery , alabama while on their way from washington , d.c . to new orleans , to protest the still segregated buses across the south . many of the freedom riders were beaten by a white mob once they arrived at the montgomery bus station , causing several of the riders to be hospitalized . the following night abernathy and king set up an event in support of the freedom riders , where king would make an address , at abernathy 's church . more than 1,500 people came to the event that night . the church was soon surrounded by a mob of white segregationists who laid siege on the church . king , from inside the church , called the attorney general robert f . kennedy , and pleaded for help from the federal government . there was a group of united states marshals sent there to protect the event , but they were too few in number to protect the church from the angry mob , who had begun throwing rocks and bricks through the windows of the church . reinforcements with riot experience , from the marshals service , were sent in to help defend the perimeter . by the next morning , the governor of alabama , after being called by kennedy , sent in the alabama national guard , and the mob was finally dispersed . after the success of the freedom riders in montgomery , birmingham , and huntsville in 1961 , king insisted that abernathy assume the pastorate of the west hunter street baptist church in atlanta , and abernathy did so , moving his family from montgomery , alabama , in 1962 . the king/abernathy partnership spearheaded successful nonviolent movements in montgomery ; albany , georgia ; birmingham ; mississippi ; washington d.c . ; selma , alabama ; st . augustine ; chicago ; and memphis . king and abernathy journeyed together , often sharing the same hotel rooms , and leisure times with their wives , children , family , and friends . and they were both jailed 17 times together , for their involvement in the movement . . during martin luther king jr . 's assassination . on april 3 , 1968 , at the mason temple , abernathy introduced king before he made his last public address ; king said at the beginning of his now famous '' i 've been to the mountaintop '' speech : as i listened to ralph abernathy and his eloquent and generous introduction and then thought about myself , i wondered who he was talking about . it 's always good to have your closest friend and associate to say something good about you , and ralph abernathy is the best friend that i have in the world . the following day , april 4 , 1968 , abernathy was with king in the room ( room 306 ) they shared at the lorraine motel in memphis , tennessee . at 6:01 & nbsp ; p.m . while abernathy was inside the room getting cologne , king was shot while standing outside on the balcony . once the shot was fired abernathy ran out to the balcony and cradled king in his arms as he lay unconscious . abernathy accompanied king to st . joseph 's hospital within fifteen minutes of the shooting . the doctors performed an emergency surgery , but he never regained consciousness . king was pronounced dead at 7:05 & nbsp ; p.m . at age 39 . . leadership of the southern christian leadership conference . until king 's assassination , abernathy had served as southern christian leadership conference 's first financial secretary/treasurer and vice president at-large . after king 's death , abernathy assumed the presidency of the sclc . one of his first roles was to take up the role of leading a march to support striking sanitation workers in memphis , tennessee which king and abernathy had planned before king 's assassination . in may 1968 , abernathy led the poor people 's campaign in washington , d.c . . protest at nasa . on the eve of the apollo 11 launch , july 15 , 1969 , abernathy arrived at cape canaveral with several hundred members of the poor people campaign to protest spending of government space exploration , while many americans remained poor . he was met by thomas o . paine , the administrator of nasa , whom he told that in the face of such suffering , space flight represented an inhuman priority and funds should be spent instead to '' feed the hungry , clothe the naked , tend the sick , and house the homeless '' . paine told abernathy that the advances in space exploration were '' child 's play '' compared to the '' tremendously difficult human problems '' of society abernathy was discussing . despite protesting the launch , abernathy acknowledged that he was '' profoundly moved by the nation 's achievements in space and the heroism of the three men embarking for the moon '' , but added that '' what we can do for space and exploration we demand that we do for starving people . '' later in 1969 , abernathy also took part in a labor struggle in charleston , south carolina , on behalf of the hospital workers of the local union 1199b , which led to a living wage increase and improved working conditions for thousands of hospital workers . . wounded knee . in 1973 , abernathy helped negotiate a peace settlement at the wounded knee uprising between the federal bureau of investigation and the leaders of the american indian movement , russell means and dennis banks . abernathy remained president of the sclc for nine years following king 's death in 1968 . after king 's death the organization lost the popularity it had under his leadership . by the time abernathy left the organization the sclc had become indebted , and critics stated that it was n't as imaginative as the sclc led by dr . king . in 1977 abernathy resigned from his leadership role at the sclc , and was bestowed the title president emeritus . . political career and later activism . abernathy addressed the united nations in 1971 on world peace . he was also a member of the board of directors of the martin luther king jr . center for nonviolent social change . in 1977 , he ran unsuccessfully for georgia 's 5th congressional district seat , losing to congressman wyche fowler . he founded the nonprofit organization foundation for economic enterprises development ( feed ) , which offered managerial and technical training , creating jobs , income , business and trade opportunities for underemployed and unemployed workers for underprivileged blacks . in 1979 , abernathy endorsed senator edward m . kennedy 's candidacy for the presidency of the united states . however , he shocked critics a few weeks before the 1980 november election , when he endorsed the front-runner , ronald reagan , over the struggling presidential campaign of jimmy carter . abernathy stated of his endorsement : '' the republican party has too long ignored us and the democratic party has taken us for granted and so since all of my colleagues and the latter in various places across the country were supporting the democratic party , i felt that i should support ronald reagan . '' after the disappointing performance of the reagan administration on civil rights and other areas , abernathy withdrew his endorsement of reagan in 1984 . in 1982 , abernathy testified—along with his executive associate , james peterson of berkeley , california—before the congressional hearings calling for the extension of the voting rights act . documents declassified in 2017 show that abernathy was on the national security agency watchlist because of fbi leadership 's hatred of the civil rights movement . . and the walls came tumbling down . in late 1989 , harper collins published abernathy 's autobiography , and the walls came tumbling down . it was his final published accounting of his close partnership with king and their work in the civil rights movement . in it he revealed king 's marital infidelity , stating that king had sexual relations with two women on the night of april 3 , 1968 ( after his '' i 've been to the mountaintop '' speech earlier that day ) . the book 's revelations became the source of much controversy , as did abernathy . jesse jackson and other civil rights activists made a statement in october 1989—after the book 's release—that the book was '' slander '' and that '' brain surgery '' must have altered abernathy 's perception . . unification church . in the 1980s , the unification church hired abernathy as a spokesperson to protest the news media 's use of the term '' moonies '' , which they compared with the word '' nigger '' . abernathy also served as vice president of the unification church-affiliated group american freedom coalition , and served on two unification church boards of directors . . death . abernathy died at emory crawford long memorial hospital on the morning of april 17 , 1990 , from two blood clots that traveled to his heart and lungs , five weeks after his 64th birthday . after his death , george h . w . bush , then-president of the united states issued the following statement : barbara and i join with all americans to mourn the passing of the rev . ralph abernathy , a great leader in the struggle for civil rights for all americans and a tireless campaigner for justice . he is entombed in the chapel mausoleum of lincoln cemetery in atlanta , georgia . resting places : the burial places of 14,000 famous persons , by scott wilson at abernathy 's behest , his tomb has the simple inscription : '' i tried .
