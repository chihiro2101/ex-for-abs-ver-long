Georg Ebers

life . georg ebers was born in berlin and was the youngest of the five children of an affluent family of bankers and porcelain manufacturers . the ebers children were raised by their mother on her own , after their father committed suicide shortly after ebers was born . his mother ran a salon popular among members of the intelligentsia , which included georg wilhelm friedrich hegel , the brothers grimm , and alexander von humboldt . at göttingen , ebers studied jurisprudence , and at berlin oriental languages and archaeology . having made a special study of egyptology , he became in 1865 dozent in egyptian language and antiquities at jena , becoming professor in 1868 . in 1870 he was appointed professor in these subjects at leipzig . he had made two scientific journeys to egypt , and his first work of importance , ägypten und die bücher moses , appeared in 1867–1868 . in 1874 he edited the celebrated medical papyrus ( papyrus ebers ) which he had discovered in thebes ( translation by h . joachim , 1890 ) . ebers early conceived the idea of popularising egyptian lore by means of historical romances . eine ägyptische königstochter ( an egyptian princess ) was published in 1864 and obtained great success . his subsequent works of the same kind — uarda ( 1877 ) , homo sum ( 1878 ) , die schwestern ( 1880 ) , der kaiser ( 1881 ) , of which the scene is laid in egypt at the time of hadrian , serapis ( 1885 ) , die nilbraut ( 1887 ) , and kleopatra ( 1894 ) — were also well received , and did much to make the public familiar with the discoveries of egyptologists . '' ebers had an extraordinary career , as professor of egyptology at leipzig , journalist and best-selling novelist . his series of egyptian-themed romances ( varda , an egyptian princess , cleopatra , and others ) helped stimulate interest in egyptian artefacts and keep it alive .
