'' in 1618 , after shakespeare 's death , the 12-year-old davenant wrote an ode '' in remembrance of master shakespeare '' . alan palmer , veronica palmer , who 's who in shakespeare 's england , palgrave macmillan , 1 may 1999 , p.61 . he attended lincoln college , oxford , for a while in about 1620 , but left before gaining any degree , becoming a page to the duchess of richmond . in london in 1630 , he contracted a venereal disease , and was given a syphilis treatment by thomas cademan . as a convalescent , he left for the country in 1632 for a time . the syphilis severely disfigured his nose , resulting in damage that is discreetly depicted in john greenhill 's portrait . his ruined nose was the subject of much ribald comment by his enemies . raymond a . anselment , the realms of apollo : literature and healing in seventeenth-century england , university of delaware press , 1995 , p.109 . . poet laureate and civil war . following the death of ben jonson in 1637 , davenant was named poet laureate in 1638 . he was a supporter of king charles i in the english civil war . in 1641 , before the war began , he was declared guilty of high treason by parliament along with john suckling , after he participated in the first army plot , a royalist plan to use the army to occupy london . he fled to france . alan hager , the age of milton : an encyclopedia of major 17th-century british and american authors , greenwood publishing group , 2004 , p.104 returning to join the king 's army when the war started , he was knighted two years later by king charles following the siege of gloucester . in 1645 , after the royalist defeat at the battle of naseby , he retired to paris , where he became a roman catholic and worked on his epic poem gondibert . that same year he was appointed emissary to france , and in 1649 was given the symbolic post of treasurer of the colony of virginia by the exiled charles ii . the following year , he was made lieutenant governor of maryland , but was captured at sea , imprisoned , and sentenced to death . in july , 1650 , he was put on trial for his life , along with others in front of the newly established high court of justice . he is said to have been saved by the intervention of john milton . he spent all of 1651 in the tower of london , where he continued writing gondibert . on his release in 1652 , he immediately published gondibert , but he was only pardoned in 1654 . in order to avoid the strict laws of censorship in force in all public places at the time , he turned a room of his home , rutland house , into a private theatre where his works , and those of other writers considered seditious , could be performed . a performance of his the siege of rhodes at rutland house in 1656 is considered to be the first performance of an english opera , and also included england 's first known professional actress , mrs coleman . restoration . davenant once again found himself in legal trouble in 1659 , when he was imprisoned for his part in sir george booth 's uprising in cheshire after the death of cromwell . he was , however , released the same year , and left once more for france . when charles ii was restored to the throne , davenant returned to england . the restoration also led to the re-opening of theatres , which had been closed due to the influence of the puritans under cromwell . in 1660 , he is publicly recorded as being one of the two theatrical patentees , along with thomas killigrew , who obtained a monopoly of public theatre performances . he headed the duke of york 's men and produced highly successful theatrical seasons at lincoln 's inn fields from 1660 until his death in 1668 . among his more successful productions were some shakespeare plays , including : hamlet , henry viii , and macbeth , as well as non-shakespeare plays such as sir samuel tuke 's the tragedy of five hours and john dryden 's comedy sir martin marall . he had returned to england sometime before the initial production of his adaptation of shakespeare 's the tempest , written with john dryden , who would be named the next ( and first officially by letters patent ) poet laureate . he died in london on 7 april 1668 , shortly after his final play , the man 's the master , was first performed . he is buried in poets ' corner at westminster abbey where the inscription on his tablet reads '' o rare sir william davenant . '' it has been noted that the original inscription on ben jonson 's tablet , which was already removed by the time davenant died , was '' o rare ben , '' which was the name shakespeare supposedly had for jonson .
