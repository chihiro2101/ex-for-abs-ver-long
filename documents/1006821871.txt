Petal

corolla . the role of the corolla in plant evolution has been studied extensively since charles darwin postulated a theory of the origin of elongated corollae and corolla tubes . a corolla of separate petals , without fusion of individual segments , is apopetalous . if the petals are free from one another in the corolla , the plant is polypetalous or choripetalous ; while if the petals are at least partially fused , it is gamopetalous or sympetalous . in the case of fused tepals , the term is syntepalous . the corolla in some plants forms a tube . variations . petals can differ dramatically in different species . the merosity may hold clues to a plant 's classification . for example , flowers on eudicots ( the largest group of dicots ) most frequently have four or five petals while flowers on monocots have three or six petals , although there are many exceptions to this rule . the petal whorl or corolla may be either radially or bilaterally symmetrical ( see symmetry in biology and floral symmetry ) . if all of the petals are essentially identical in size and shape , the flower is said to be regular or actinomorphic ( meaning '' ray-formed '' ) . many flowers are symmetrical in only one plane ( i.e . , symmetry is bilateral ) and are termed irregular or zygomorphic ( meaning '' yoke- '' or '' pair-formed '' ) . in irregular flowers , other floral parts may be modified from the regular form , but the petals show the greatest deviation from radial symmetry . examples of zygomorphic flowers may be seen in orchids and members of the fabaceae . in many plants of the asteraceae such as the sunflower , helianthus annuus , the circumference of the flower head is composed of ray florets . each ray floret is anatomically an individual flower with a single large petal . florets in the center of the disc typically have no or very reduced petals . in some plants such as narcissus the lower part of the petals or tepals are fused to form a floral cup ( hypanthium ) above the ovary , and from which the petals proper extend . petal often consists of two parts : the upper , broad part , similar to leaf blade , also called the blade and the lower part , narrow , similar to leaf petiole , called the claw , separated from each other at the limb . claws are developed in petals of some flowers of the family brassicaceae , such as erysimum cheiri . the inception and further development of petals show a great variety of patterns . sattler , r . 1973 . organogenesis of flowers . a photographic text-atlas . university of toronto press . petals of different species of plants vary greatly in color or color pattern , both in visible light and in ultraviolet . such patterns often function as guides to pollinators and are variously known as nectar guides , pollen guides , and floral guides . genetics . the genetics behind the formation of petals , in accordance with the abc model of flower development , are that sepals , petals , stamens , and carpels are modified versions of each other . it appears that the mechanisms to form petals evolved very few times ( perhaps only once ) , rather than evolving repeatedly from stamens . . significance of pollination . pollination is an important step in the sexual reproduction of higher plants . pollen is produced by the male flower or by the male organs of monoecious flowers . pollen does not move on its own and thus requires wind or animal pollinators to disperse the pollen to the stigma ( botany ) of the same or nearby flowers . however , pollinators are rather selective in determining the flowers they choose to pollinate . this develops competition between flowers and as a result flowers must provide incentives to appeal to pollinators ( unless the flower self-pollinates or is involved in wind pollination ) . petals play a major role in competing to attract pollinators . henceforth pollination dispersal could occur and the survival of many species of flowers could prolong . functions and purposes . petals have various functions and purposes depending on the type of plant . in general , petals operate to protect some parts of the flower and attract/repel specific pollinators . function . this is where the positioning of the flower petals are located on the flower is the corolla e.g . the buttercup having shiny yellow flower petals which contain guidelines amongst the petals in aiding the pollinator towards the nectar . pollinators have the ability to determine specific flowers they wish to pollinate . cares-suarez , r , poch , t , acevedo , r.f , acosta-bravo , i , pimentel , c , espinoza , c , cares , r.a , munoz , p , gonzalez , a.v , botto-mahan , c ( 2011 ) do pollinators respond in a dose-dependent manner to flower herbivory ?
