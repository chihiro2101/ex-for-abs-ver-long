'' the great white hope '' . the term , '' the great white hope , '' reflects the racism and segregation of the era in which jack johnson fought . johnson , the first african american to hold the world heavyweight championship title , was one of the best fighters of his generation . yet , white reaction against johnson 's win and his very public relationships with white women was so strong that , in 1912 , the united states congress , concerned that film scenes of johnson pummeling white boxers would cause race riots , passed a law making it illegal to transport prizefight films across state lines .
