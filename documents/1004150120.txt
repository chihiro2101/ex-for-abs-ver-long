'' gimpel , diary of an art dealer ( john rosenberg , tr . ) 1966:211 . barnard had a commanding personal manner : '' he talks of art as if it were a cabalistic science of which he is the only astrologer '' , wrote the unsympathetic gimpel ; '' he speaks to impress . he 's a sort of rasputin of criticism . the rockefellers are his imperial family . and the dealers court him .
