Bad Religion

logo . bad religion 's logo has been referred to by fans as the '' crossbuster '' . it features a black latin cross with a red prohibition sign over it . it was created by guitarist brett gurewitz by drawing it on a piece of paper and showing it to the rest of the band . in the live documentary along the way , greg hetson , greg graffin and jay bentley are all asked the question '' what 's the meaning of the bad religion symbol ? '' . hetson : '' the meaning of the symbol ? it 's , to me it 's just against any established set of rules , and the church just seemed to be the easiest target . it has a . you know , the christian religion has this symbol , it has a bunch of beliefs . they say 'you either believe it or not , this is the way it is ' and that 's not the way the world works . so , it was just an easy target to use , to be anti-establishment . '' graffin : '' yeah . when it first came out , we all liked it , you know ? we were little kids and we thought 'yeah , this is a great idea , it 'll piss people off . ' you know , when you 're fifteen years-old , the first thing you think about is 'how can i piss people off ? ' , you know ? and it 's very good to . it 's very easy to piss people off when you 're fifteen , especially it 's easy to piss off your parents and adults , in general . but as you get a little older , or as i 've gotten older , i 've looked back on the symbol of bad religion as still having some meaning , but i wish it was n't so offensive to other people , because other people could benefit from the ideas , i think , that we 've laid down . for instance , what we look at it today as is just a symbol . the cross is sort of the international symbol points to a no parking sign behind him as this parking symbol , the no parking is . everybody in the world can recognize it . the cross we look at as an international symbol for religion , and it 's not anti-christian , it 's not anti-buddhist , it 's not anti-jewish , it 's not anti-anything . it 's simply is sic showing . it 's our way of showing that we do n't like to subscribe to dogmatic ways of life and dogmatic views on life and that religion , in general , is founded in dogma and in restriction of ideas , restriction of thought and it 's these things that i feel are bad about religion , it 's also very bad about nationalistic views , it 's very bad . it 's something that mankind , as a group , is not going to benefit from ; it 's only something that mankind will . it 's something mankind will . i 'm sorry , it 's something that will instill violence , and it will instill fighting , and it will instill non-cooperation of different groups of humans . '' bentley : '' brett made that when we were fifteen years-old . brett came up with a piece of paper and said 'look at this ! ' and , and we all laughed and said 'that 's really funny ' 'cause the concept of taking that symbol and putting the 'no ' thing on top of it was just . it seemed shocking enough and good enough , because it represented . sometimes people took it that it represented that we were like satan worshipers and that we were not liking god , but it was more against , in america , is sic there 's too much tv evangelism , of , you know , 'send me monies and god will love you ' , and it 's like scoffs . so that was , at the time , that was very popular , when we were starting , so that was one of the , one of the things that we still hate the most , is having to pay to be saved in some , like , ridiculous . you do n't need that . you do n't need anybody to tell you that you have to pay money . so that was one of the reasons why we did that , and it 's just . it 's one of those things that , it happened and we took it and , maybe . it was a really easy symbol for kids to spray paint and it 's an easy symbol to put on a shirt and , so , it became , maybe , bigger than what it really was in the beginning . it was just , it was something that we liked and we thought that it would piss our parents off or something , you know ? and then , when the records came out it just came everywhere , and so then everyone said 'what does that mean ? what does that mean ? ' whatever you want it to mean , you know . you decide . '' brian baker , who joined the band later in their career , sums it up as follows : '' the name bad religion and the crossbuster logo came to pass in the minds of two fifteen-year-olds who were trying to find the most offensive name and image they could possibly find for the punk band they were starting in their garage . these are not people who thought that 21 years later they would be on the telephone doing interviews .
