Color television

development . the human eye 's detection system in the retina consists primarily of two types of light detectors : rod cells that capture light , dark , and shapes/figures , and the cone cells that detect color . a typical retina contains 120 & nbsp ; million rods and 4.5 & nbsp ; million to 6 & nbsp ; million cones , which are divided into three types , each one with a characteristic profile of excitability by different wavelengths of the spectrum of visible light . this means that the eye has far more resolution in brightness , or '' luminance '' , than in color . however , post-processing of the optic nerve and other portions of the human visual system combine the information from the rods and cones to re-create what appears to be a high-resolution color image . the eye has limited bandwidth to the rest of the visual system , estimated at just under 8 mbit/s . michael reilly , '' calculating the speed of sight '' , new scientist , july 28 , 2006 this manifests itself in a number of ways , but the most important in terms of producing moving images is the way that a series of still images displayed in quick succession will appear to be continuous smooth motion . this illusion starts to work at about 16 frame/s , and common motion pictures use 24 frame/s . television , using power from the electrical grid , historically tuned its rate in order to avoid interference with the alternating current being supplied – in north america , some central and south american countries , taiwan , korea , part of japan , the philippines , and a few other countries , this was 60 video fields per second to match the 60 & nbsp ; hz power , while in most other countries it was 50 fields per second to match the 50 & nbsp ; hz power . the ntsc color system changed from the black-and-white 60-fields-per-second standard to 59.94 fields per second to make the color circuitry simpler ; the 1950s tv sets had matured enough that the power frequency/field rate mismatch was no longer important . modern tv sets can display multiple field rates ( 50 , 59.94 , or 60 , in either interlaced or progressive scan ) while accepting power at various frequencies ( often the operating range is specified as 48–62 & nbsp ; hz ) . in its most basic form , a color broadcast can be created by broadcasting three monochrome images , one each in the three colors of red , green , and blue ( rgb ) . when displayed together or in rapid succession , these images will blend together to produce a full-color image as seen by the viewer . to do so without making the images flicker , the refresh time of all three images put together would have to be above the critical limit , and generally the same as a single black and white image . this would require three times the number of images to be sent in the same time , and thus greatly increase the amount of radio bandwidth required to send the complete signal and thus similarly increase the required radio spectrum . early plans for color television in the united states included a move from very high frequency ( vhf ) to ultra high frequency ( uhf ) to open up additional spectrum . one of the great technical challenges of introducing color broadcast television was the desire to conserve bandwidth . in the united states , after considerable research , the national television systems committee national television system committee ( 1951–1953 ) , report and reports of panel no . 11 , 11-a , 12–19 , with some supplementary references cited in the reports , and the petition for adoption of transmission standards for color television before the federal communications commission , n.p . , 1953 , 17 v . illus . , diagrams . , tables . 28 cm . lc control no . :54021386 library of congress online catalog approved an all-electronic system developed by rca which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth . the brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution , while color-capable televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display . the higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the eye to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image . the ntsc standard represented a major technical achievement . early television . experiments with facsimile image transmission systems that used radio broadcasts to transmit images date to the 19th century . it was not until the 20th century that advances in electronics and light detectors made what we know as television practical . a key problem was the need to convert a 2d image into a '' 1d '' radio signal ; some form of image scanning was needed to make this work . early systems generally used a device known as a '' nipkow disk '' , which was a spinning disk with a series of holes punched in it that caused a spot to scan across and down the image . a single photodetector behind the disk captured the image brightness at any given spot , which was converted into a radio signal and broadcast . a similar disk was used at the receiver side , with a light source behind the disk instead of a detector . a number of such mechanical television systems were being used experimentally in the 1920s . the best-known was john logie baird 's , which was actually used for regular public broadcasting in britain for several years . indeed , baird 's system was demonstrated to members of the royal institution in london in 1926 in what is generally recognized as the first demonstration of a true , working television system . in spite of these early successes , all mechanical television systems shared a number of serious problems . being mechanically driven , perfect synchronization of the sending and receiving discs was not easy to ensure , and irregularities could result in major image distortion . another problem was that the image was scanned within a small , roughly rectangular area of the disk 's surface , so that larger , higher-resolution displays required increasingly unwieldy disks and smaller holes that produced increasingly dim images . rotating drums bearing small mirrors set at progressively greater angles proved more practical than nipkow discs for high-resolution mechanical scanning , allowing images of 240 lines and more to be produced , but such delicate , high-precision optical components were not commercially practical for home receivers . it was clear to a number of developers that a completely electronic scanning system would be superior , and that the scanning could be achieved in a vacuum tube via electrostatic or magnetic means . converting this concept into a usable system took years of development and several independent advances . the two key advances were philo farnsworth 's electronic scanning system , and vladimir zworykin 's iconoscope camera . the iconoscope , based on kálmán tihanyi 's early patents , superseded the farnsworth-system . with these systems , the bbc began regularly scheduled black-and-white television broadcasts in 1936 , but these were shut down again with the start of world war ii in 1939 . in this time thousands of television sets had been sold . the receivers developed for this program , notably those from pye ltd . , played a key role in the development of radar . by 22 march 1935 , 180-line black-and-white television programs were being broadcast from the paul nipkow tv station in berlin . in 1936 , under the guidance of the minister of public enlightenment and propaganda , joseph goebbels , direct transmissions from fifteen mobile units at the 1936 summer olympics were transmitted to selected small television houses in berlin and hamburg . in 1941 , the first ntsc meetings produced a single standard for us broadcasts . us television broadcasts began in earnest in the immediate post-war era , and by 1950 there were 6 & nbsp ; million televisions in the united states . '' television '' , the world book encyclopedia 2003 : 119 . all-mechanical color . the basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built . among the earliest published proposals for television was one by maurice le blanc in 1880 for a color system , including the first mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning , although he gave no practical details . m . le blanc , '' etude sur la transmission électrique des impressions lumineuses '' , la lumière electrique , vol . 11 , december 1 , 1880 , pp . & nbsp ;

and three light sources , controlled by the signal , at the receiving end , with a commutator to alternate their illumination . john logie baird , television apparatus and the like , u.s . patent , filed in u.k . in 1928 . the demonstration was of a young girl wearing different colored hats . the girl , noele gordon , later became a tv actress in the soap opera crossroads . as detailed by itv in their on-air obituary broadcast prior to an episode of crossroads broadcast on april 14 , 1985 as noted in bbc one 's tv heros series , 1991 baird also made the world 's first color over-the-air broadcast on february 4 , 1938 , sending a mechanically scanned 120-line image from baird 's crystal palace studios to a projection screen at london 's dominion theatre . baird television : crystal palace television studios . previous color television demonstrations in the u.k . had been via closed circuit . mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by bell laboratories in june 1929 using three complete systems of solar cell , amplifiers , glow-tubes , and color filters , with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red , green , and blue images into one full color image . hybrid systems . as was the case with black-and-white television , an electronic means of scanning would be superior to the mechanical systems like baird 's . the obvious solution on the broadcast end would be to use three conventional iconoscopes with colored filters in front of them to produce an rgb signal . using three separate tubes each looking at the same scene would produce slight differences in parallax between the frames , so in practice a single lens was used with a mirror or prism system to separate the colors for the separate tubes . each tube captured a complete frame and the signal was converted into radio in a fashion essentially identical to the existing black-and-white systems . the problem with this approach was there was no simple way to recombine them on the receiver end . if each image was sent at the same time on different frequencies , the images would have to be '' stacked '' somehow on the display , in real time . the simplest way to do this would be to reverse the system used in the camera : arrange three separate black-and-white displays behind colored filters and then optically combine their images using mirrors or prisms onto a suitable screen , like frosted glass . rca built just such a system in order to present the first electronically scanned color television demonstration on february 5 , 1940 , privately shown to members of the us federal communications commission at the rca plant in camden , new jersey . kenyon kilbon , pioneering in electronics : a short history of the origins and growth of rca laboratories , radio corporation of america , 1919 to 1964 , chapter nine – television : monochrome to color , 1964 . v.k . zworykin with frederick olessi , iconoscope : an autobiography of vladimir zworykin , chapter 10 – television becomes a reality , 1945–1954 , 1971 .
