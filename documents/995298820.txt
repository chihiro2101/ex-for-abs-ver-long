135 film

characteristics . cassette . individual rolls of 135 film are enclosed in single-spool , light-tight , metal cassettes to allow cameras to be loaded in daylight . the film is clipped or taped to a spool and exits via a slot lined with flocking . the end of the film is cut on one side to form a leader . it has the same dimensions and perforation pitch as 35 mm movie film ( also called '' long pitch '' , ks-1870 , whereas 35 & nbsp ; mm professional motion picture camera films are always '' short pitch '' , bh-1866 ) . most cameras require the film to be rewound before the camera is opened . some motorized cameras unwind the film fully upon loading and then expose the images in reverse order , returning the film to the cassette ; this protects all images except the last one or two , should the camera back be accidentally opened . disposable cameras use the same technique so that the user does not have to rewind . since the 1980s , film cassettes have been marked with a dx encoding 6-digit barcode pattern , which identifies the manufacturer and film type ( and thus processing method ) , and the number of exposures , for the use of photofinishing laboratories . the cassettes are also manufactured with a camera auto sensing code constructed as two rows of six rectangular areas on the metal cassette surface which are either conductive or insulating , representing 32 possible film speeds , 8 possible film lengths , and 4 possible values of exposure tolerance or latitude . conforming cameras detect at least some of these areas ; only 3 contacts are needed to set a light meter for the 4 most popular film speeds . film type and speed . 135 film has been made in several emulsion types and sensitivities ( film speeds ) , standardised by iso . since the introduction of digital cameras the most usual films have colour emulsions of iso 100/21° to iso 800/30° . films of lower sensitivity ( and better picture quality ) and higher sensitivity ( for low light ) are for more specialist purposes . there are colour and monochrome films , negative and positive . monochrome film is usually panchromatic ; orthochromatic has fallen out of use . film designed to be sensitive to infrared radiation can be obtained , both monochrome and with false-colour ( or pseudocolour ) rendition . more exotic emulsions have been available in 135 than other roll-film sizes . image format . the term 135 format usually refers to a 36 & times ; 24 & nbsp ; mm film format , commonly known as 35 & nbsp ; mm format . the 36 & times ; 24 & nbsp ; mm format is common to digital image sensors , where it is typically referred to as full frame format . on 135 film , the longer dimension of the 36 & times ; 24 & nbsp ; mm frame runs parallel to the length of the film . the perforation size and pitch are according to the standard specification ks-1870 . for each frame , the film advances 8 perforations . this is specified as 38.00 & nbsp ; mm . this allows for 2 & nbsp ; mm gaps between frames . camera models typically have different locations for the sprocket which advances the film . therefore , each camera model 's frame may vary in position relative to the perforations . the film is approximately 0.14 & nbsp ; mm thick . other image formats have been applied to 135 film , such as the half-frame format of 18 & times ; 24 & nbsp ; mm which earned some popularity in the 1960s , and the 24 & times ; 24 & nbsp ; mm of the robot cameras . the successful range of olympus pen f cameras utilized the smaller half-frame size , allowing the design of a very compact slr camera . unusual formats include the 24 & times ; 32 & nbsp ; mm and 24 & times ; 34 & nbsp ; mm on the early nikon rangefinders , and 24 & times ; 23 & nbsp ; mm for use with some stereo cameras . in 1967 , the soviet kmz factory introduced a 24 & times ; 58 & nbsp ; mm panoramic format with its horizont camera ( descendants of which are called , in the roman alphabet , horizon ) . in 1998 , hasselblad and fuji introduced a 24 & times ; 65 & nbsp ; mm panoramic format with the xpan/tx-1 camera . there is also a 21 & times ; 14 & nbsp ; mm format used by tessina subminiature camera . length . the film is available in lengths for varying numbers of exposures . the standard full-length roll has always been 36 exposures ( assuming a standard 24 & times ; 36 frame size ) . through about 1980 , 20 exposure rolls were the only shorter length with widespread availability . since then , 20 exposure rolls have been largely discontinued in favour of 24 and 12 exposure rolls . with most cameras it is possible to get up to 3 more exposures than the nominal capacity on the film if the camera is loaded in a darkroom and some cameras allow this with daylight loading . 27 exposure disposable cameras are loaded in the dark with standard 24 exposure cassette . other , mostly shorter lengths have been manufactured . there have been some 6 , 8 , 10 , and 15 exposure rolls given away as samples , sometimes in disposable cameras , or used by insurance adjusters to document damage claims . 12 exposure rolls have been used widely in the daily press . photographers who load their own cassettes can use any length of film – with thinner film base up to 45 exposures will fit . ilford at one time made hp5 black-and-white film on a thin polyester base , which allowed 72 exposures in a single cassette . they produced special reels and tanks to allow this to be processed . history . 35 mm still cameras . the 135 film size is derived from earlier still cameras using lengths of 35 & nbsp ; mm cine film , the same size as , but with different perforations than , 135 film . the 35 & nbsp ; mm film standard for motion picture film was established in thomas edison 's lab by william kennedy dickson . dickson took 70 & nbsp ; mm film stock supplied by george eastman 's eastman kodak company . the 70 & nbsp ; mm film was cut lengthwise into two equal width ( 35 & nbsp ; mm ) strips , spliced together end to end , and then perforated along both edges . the original picture size was 18×24 & nbsp ; mm ( half the full frame size later used in still photography ) . there were four perforations on each side of a motion picture frame . while the leica popularized the format , several 35 & nbsp ; mm still cameras used perforated movie film before the leica was introduced in the 1920s . the first patent for one was issued to leo , audobard and baradat in england in 1908 . the first full-scale production camera was the homeos , a stereo camera , produced by jules richard in 1913 , and was sold until 1920 . it took 18x24 mm stereo pairs , using two tessar lenses . in 1909 , the french designed a device small-format photography , the '' '' , which used the 35 & nbsp ; mm perforated film to take consecutive hundred views in 18×24 & nbsp ; mm . he manufactured , won the gold medal in the concours lépine , and in 1910 sold at a small scale and without much success . the first big-selling 35 & nbsp ; mm still camera was the american tourist multiple , which also appeared in 1913 , at a cost of 175 ( at today 's prices , the same cost as a modern 3000 leica . ) the first camera to take full-frame 24×36 & nbsp ; mm exposures seems to be the simplex , introduced in the u.s . in 1914 . it took either 800 half-frame or 400 full-frame shots on 50 & nbsp ; ft ( 15.2 & nbsp ; m ) rolls . the minigraph , by levy-roth of berlin , another half-frame small camera was sold in germany in 1915 . the patent for the debrie sept camera , a combination 35 & nbsp ; mm still and movie camera was issued in 1918 ; the camera sold from 1922 . the furet camera made and sold in france in 1923 took full-frame 24x36 mm negatives , and was the first cheap small 35 & nbsp ; mm camera of similar appearance to more modern models . leica . the leica camera designed by oskar barnack used 35 & nbsp ; mm film , and proved that a format as small as 24 & nbsp ; mm & times ; 36 & nbsp ; mm was suitable for professional photography . although barnack designed his prototype camera around 1913 , the first experimental production run of ur-leicas ( serial no . 100 to 130 ) did not take place until 1923 . full-scale production of the leica did not begin until 1925 . while by that time there were at least a dozen other 35 & nbsp ; mm cameras available , the leica was a success , and came to be associated with the format . mostly because of this 35 & nbsp ; mm popularity , as well as the entire company legacy , early leica cameras are considered as highly collectible items these days . the original leica prototype holds the record as being the world 's most expensive camera , selling for €2.16 & nbsp ; million in 2012 . pre loaded cassettes and kodak retina cameras . in the earliest days , the photographer had to load the film into reusable cassettes and , at least for some cameras , cut the film leader . in 1934 , kodak introduced a 135 daylight-loading single-use cassette . this cassette was engineered so that it could be used in both leica and zeiss ikon contax cameras along with the camera for which it was invented , namely the kodak retina camera . the retina camera and this daylight loading cassette were the invention of dr . august nagel of the kodak ag dr . nagel werk in stuttgart . kodak bought dr . august nagel 's company in december , 1931 , and began marketing the kodak retina in the summer of 1934 . the first kodak retina camera was a typ 117 . the 35 & nbsp ; mm kodak retina camera line remained in production until 1969 . kodak also introduced a line of american made cameras that were simpler and more economical than the retina . argus , too , made a long-lived range of 35 & nbsp ; mm cameras ; notably the argus c3 . kodak launched 135-format kodachrome color film in 1936 . agfa followed with the introduction of agfacolor neu later in the same year . the designations 235 and 435 refer to 35 & nbsp ; mm film in daylight-loading spools , that could be loaded into leica or contax style reusable cassettes without need of a darkroom . the 335 was a daylight loading spool for the 24 & times ; 23 & nbsp ; mm stereo format . the reflex camera . image : nikon f slr camera with nikkor-s auto 1,4 f 5,8cm.jpg thumb 220px nikon f chrome with eyelevel prism and nikkor-s auto 1:1,4 f 5,8cm lens ( 1959 ) – an early slr system camera . reflex viewfinders , both twin-and single-lens , had been used with earlier cameras using plates and rollfilm . the first 35 & nbsp ; mm single-lens reflex ( slr ) was the kine exakta , introduced in 1936 . world war ii interrupted development of the type . after the war , exakta resumed development and the contax s model with the now familiar pentaprism viewing feature was introduced in 1949 . in the 1950s , the slr also began to be produced in japan by such companies as asahi and miranda . asahi 's pentax introduced the instant-return mirror , important for the popularity of slrs ; until then , the viewfinder on an slr camera blanked as the mirror sprang out of the optical path just before taking the picture , returning when the film was wound on . nikon 's f model , introduced in march 1959 , was a system camera that greatly improved the quality and utility of 35 & nbsp ; mm format cameras , encouraging professionals ( especially photojournalists ) to switch from larger format cameras to the versatile , rugged , and fast slr design . numerous other film formats waxed and waned in popularity , but by the 1970s , interchangeable-lens slr cameras and smaller rangefinders , from expensive leicas to '' point-and-shoot '' pocket cameras , were all using 35 & nbsp ; mm film , and manufacturers had proliferated . colour films improved , both for print negatives and reversal slides , while black-and-white films offered smoother grain and faster speeds than previously available . since 35 & nbsp ; mm was preferred by both amateur and professional photographers , makers of film stock have long offered the widest range of different film speeds and types in the format . the dx encoding was introduced in the 1980s , as were single-use cameras pre-loaded with 35 & nbsp ; mm film and using plastic lenses of reasonable enough quality to produce acceptable snapshots . automated all-in-one processing and printing machines made 35 & nbsp ; mm developing easier and less expensive , so that quality colour prints became available not only from photographic specialty stores , but also from supermarkets , drugstores , and big box retailers , often in less than an hour . from 1996 . in 1996 , a smaller format called advanced photo system ( aps ) was introduced by a consortium of photographic companies in an attempt to supersede 135 film . due in part to its small negative size , aps was not taken seriously as a professional format , despite the production of aps slrs . in the point-and-shoot markets at which the format was primarily aimed , it enjoyed moderate initial success , but still never rivalled the market penetration of 135 . within five years of its launch , cheap digital compact cameras started becoming widely available , and aps sales plummeted . such digital compact cameras also eroded the market for 35 & nbsp ; mm compact cameras . digital slrs at a price ( and quality ) comparable with consumer-level 35 & nbsp ; mm slrs were developed , further reducing the demand for 135 film . most of these use so-called '' aps-c '' sized sensors , approximately 16 & times ; 24 & nbsp ; mm in size ( half-frame ) . a few digital slrs use '' full frame '' sensors , the same size as 135 film . sales of all film sizes declined to a very large extent ; of the remaining sizes , 135 is the most popular . while they have shifted the vast majority of their product lines to digital , major camera manufacturers such as canon and nikon continue to make expensive professional-grade 35 & nbsp ; mm film slrs ( such as the canon eos-1v and the nikon f6 ) . introductory 35 & nbsp ; mm slrs , compact film point-and-shoot cameras , and single-use cameras continue to be built and sold by a number of makers . leica finally introduced the digital leica m8 rangefinder in 2007 , but continues to make its m series rangefinder film cameras and lenses . a digital camera back for the leica r9 slr camera was discontinued in 2007 . on march 25 , 2009 , leica discontinued the r9 slr and r-series lenses .
