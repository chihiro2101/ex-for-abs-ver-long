Dave Walker

history . early life . walker was raised by his strict grandmother in a household where rock and roll was not allowed to be watched on television . his first experience with public singing came at a very young age at a methodist church , where dave volunteered to sing '' away in a manger '' . as teenagers , dave and his brother mick formed a skiffle group which played at weddings and youth gatherings . . career . the redcaps ( 1960–1965 ) . dave walker started his career in 1960 with a brumbeat r & b band called the redcaps . the band was formed by dave on rhythm guitar , his twin brother mick walker ( born michael walker , 25 january 1945 , in walsall - died 25 february 2016 ) on bass guitar , ronnie on lead vocals , ronnie 's brother roy brown on lead guitar , mac broadhurst on saxophone , and jimmy richards on drums . following an on-stage argument between dave walker and ronnie brown in 1962 , ronnie departed the band , leaving dave to take on the role of lead vocalist ; and following a tour of france in 1964 both roy brown and jimmy richards departed the band , and were replaced by mick blythe and alan morley ( who later joined chicken shack ) respectively . they recorded three singles for decca records , who were trying to cash in on the success of the beatles , as the redcaps had opened for the beatles in concert on four occasions . their first single , in 1963 , was a cover of the pulsating isley brothers 's '' shout '' backed by '' little things you do '' an original tune written by dave walker and roy brown . however , lulu had beaten the redcaps to the british charts with her version of '' shout '' . their next single , in 1964 , was a cover of chuck berry 's '' talking about you '' backed by '' come on girl '' . it has been rumoured that guitarist jimmy page , later of led zeppelin , played on '' talking about you '' , in his early pre-yardbirds london session days , but walker has since said page does not play on this track . the story behind the rumour being that page was available , if needed , but redcaps guitarist roy brown handled the lead parts himself . the track was recorded in a different studio from where page was working , on the day of the recording . their final single , '' funny things '' an original tune penned by blythe backed by '' mighty fine girl '' , was also released in 1964 ; but after all three singles flopped , the redcaps disbanded in 1965 . mick walker died on 25 february 2016 , aged 71 . . beckett ( 1965–1969 ) . between 1965 and 1969 walker played in beckett , a band which included pete oliver , don mcginty and colin timmons . beckett played three days a week at the rum runner nightclub in birmingham ( which at the time was managed by mick walker ) , but they never recorded , and disbanded in late 1969 . . the idle race ( 1970–1971 ) . in early 1970 , jeff lynne left his original band , the idle race , to join the move with former idle race guitarist roy wood ; just prior to its evolution into the electric light orchestra . idle race had built a substantial cult following in the birmingham area , and wanted to continue after lynne 's exit . this resulted in the remaining members of the band ( rhythm guitarist dave pritchard , drummer roger spencer , and bassist greg masters ) recruiting walker as lead vocalist and mike hopkins as lead guitarist . in 1970 this new line-up recorded two singles for liberty records ; a cover of mungo jerry 's skiffle hit '' in the summertime '' , ( which reached number one in argentina ) backed by an idle race original '' told you twice '' . their second single was a cover of hotlegs ' '' neanderthal man '' backed by another idle race original number '' victim of circumstance '' . also in 1970 , idle race recorded an album time is for regal zonophone , however walker was incorrectly credited as '' richie walker '' . walker wrote two tracks ( '' i will see you '' and '' and the rain '' ) and co-wrote two others ( '' alcatraz '' and '' we want it all '' ) on this album . the album was a commercial failure and in 1971 all members of the incumbent line-up with the exception of masters ( walker , hopkins , pritchard , and spencer ) departed the band . masters ' initially put together another line-up of the idle race , but he too soon departed , and the remaining members ' soon reformed as the steve gibbons band . . savoy brown ( 1971–1972 ) . in 1971 , guitarist kim simmonds , leader of blues-rock band savoy brown , lost the rest of his band - guitarist dave peverett , bassist tony stevens , and drummer roger earl - after they decided to depart savoy brown in order to form foghat with former black cat bones guitarist rod price . to replace the departing members , simmonds hired walker on vocals , along with three recently departed members ' of stan webb 's chicken shack - keyboardist/guitarist paul raymond ( later of ufo and michael schenker group ) , bassist andy silvester , and drummer dave bidwell . they recorded the street corner talking album in 1971 on parrot/deram records , which included one of savoy brown 's biggest hits '' tell mama '' , written by raymond , and they headlined a tour over rod stewart and the grease band in early 1971 , as persistent touring was beginning to pay off for the savoys . the next album , hellbound train ( parrot/deram ) , was their biggest-selling album to date , reaching the top 40 in the us while the title cut became a concert favourite . ex-blodwyn pig/juicy lucy bassist andy pyle replaced silvester by the next album lion 's share ( parrot/deram ) for which walker wrote '' denim demon '' . lion 's share was released in late 1972 ; after savoy brown had previewed tracks on their extensive tours earlier that year . in addition to the studio albums , two '' official '' live savoy brown albums from this era , also include walker : - a 1972 new york city concert , live in central park ( relix records ) 1985 ( lp ) and 1989 ( cd ) ; and jack the toad live '70/'72 ( mooncrest records ) 2000 taken from kim simmonds ' personal collection of live savoy brown recordings . simmonds recordings are all from the same venue : the gardens edmonton , alberta , canada although foghat 's website shows the location as the coliseum , this would not have been possible , as northlands coliseum , did not open until november 1974 . but on different dates , and only two tracks include walker . one track is from november 1970 , before walker joined savoy brown , seven tracks are from october 1972 , after walker had left , but two tracks are from march 1972 when walker was in savoy brown before the late 1972 tour began , walker decided to leave savoy brown in order to join fleetwood mac . fleetwood mac ( 1972–1973 ) . in august 1972 danny kirwan was fired from fleetwood mac and was replaced by walker on vocals and bob weston on guitar . they joined fleetwood mac at a time when the band were struggling to record the penguin album ( 1973 , reprise records ) . walker only appears on two tracks , his self-penned '' the derelict '' and a cover of jr . walker & the all stars ' motown classic '' ( i 'm a ) roadrunner '' . the subsequent tour seemed to go well , and penguin was the highest charting fleetwood mac album in the us at the time , clawing its way into the top 50 . however , during the recording of their next album , mystery to me ; it was mutually agreed upon by the other five members ' of the band at that time ( mick fleetwood , christine mcvie , john mcvie , bob welch , and weston ) that walker 's vocal style and attitude '' did not fit in '' with fleetwood mac and he was asked to leave in mid-1973 ; ultimately not featuring on mystery to me . . hungry fighter ( 1974 ) . in 1974 walker formed the band hungry fighter along with his former savoy brown colleagues bassist andy silvester and keyboardist/guitarist paul raymond ; his predecessor in fleetwood mac , danny kirwan ; and former warhorse drummer mac poole . hungry fighter only managed to play one live gig , at the university of surrey in guildford , england ( which was unrecorded ) , before the consequences of a road accident sustained by their crew following the gig ( which included the destruction of the band 's equipment and serious injuries sustained by one member of the road crew ) ; combined with kirwan 's deteriorating state of mental health , caused the band to fold . mac poole died on 21 may 2015 . . raven ( 1975–1976 ) . walker then moved to san francisco and joined raven ; a band which in its short life had a revolving door of personnel but was fronted throughout by the late quicksilver messenger service guitarist john cipollina . during walker 's tenure with raven he performed at some live shows and worked on some of the early recording sessions for what would eventually become raven 's eponymous album ( postponed in 1976 but eventually released in 1980 as john cipollina 's raven ) ; however walker does not feature on the final release . during walker 's tenure in raven , the band 's line-up consisted of himself , cipollina , future greg kihn band guitarist greg douglass , bassist skip olsen , and drummer david weber . . mistress ( 1976–1977 ) . later in 1976 , walker , douglass , and olsen decided to leave raven and join keyboardist chris kovacs and drummer chris paulsen in mistress ; a fledgling band which had been around since 1972 . olsen departed later that year and was replaced by dave brown ; with kovacs also departing and the band adding charlie williams on guitar at the same time . with this line-up the band recorded some demos in the hope of gaining a recording contract , but this did not come to fruition during walker 's tenure in the band . in 1977 walker returned to england to join black sabbath and douglass departed to join the steve miller band ; leaving williams to switch to lead vocalist , and guitarists ' danny chauncey and kenny hopkins to join the band . eventually the band were able to release an album , which featured a song co-written by walker and paulsen , entitled '' high on the ride '' , amongst its track-listing ; but it is unknown whether any of walker 's vocals are featured on this track . the album also included a minor hit , with the ballad '' mistrusted love '' scraping into the us top 50 singles chart . legal difficulties also caused the eponymous album recorded by mistress ( again without walker ) in 1977 to be shelved , but it was released in 1979 by rso records , nearly two years after mistress broke up . . black sabbath ( 1977–1978 ) . tony iommi remembered walker from their days in birmingham , and contacted walker in san francisco , asking him to join black sabbath , as singer ozzy osbourne had just left the band . on the flight from san francisco to london in november 1977 , and for the next three weeks , walker wrote lyrics to the new music which the remaining members of black sabbath ( guitarist tony iommi , bassist geezer butler and drummer bill ward ) wrote for their next album . no vocals were recorded with walker , but the new line-up appeared on the bbc midlands tv program '' look hear '' on 6 january 1978 , performing their hit '' war pigs '' plus an early version of what would eventually become '' junior 's eyes '' . shortly after this appearance , osbourne decided to rejoin black sabbath , so dave walker was out before recording with the band . none of walker 's lyrics were used for black sabbath 's resulting never say die ! album , because osbourne would not sing any material written during his time out of the band . geezer butler thus resumed his traditional job as black sabbath 's primary lyricist , and completely new lyrics for the album were written , including what became '' junior 's eyes '' . after the 1978 tour to promote the album , osbourne was asked to leave , and was replaced by ronnie james dio . dave walker band 1 ( 1979 ) . after returning to the us , walker briefly assembled his own band ; consisting of himself , michael boyd and steph burnbaum on guitars , jim pugh on keyboards , jim wade on drums , and mike williams on bass . this venture was short-lived ; and following the band 's dissolution walker temporarily retired from music . savoy brown again ( 1986–1991 ) . after being out of the music business for eight years , in 1986 kim simmonds persuaded walker to rejoin his revamped savoy brown , which included al macomber on drums and jim dagnesi on bass . in 1987 walker moved to gallup , new mexico where he lived until 1998 and savoy brown recorded the make me sweat album , released in early 1988 on gnp crescendo records , followed in april 1989 by the kings of boogie album ( also on gnp crescendo ) . macomber was replaced by pete mendillo on drums , lou kaplan replaced dagnesi on bass and rick jewett augmented the line-up on keyboards for the tour to promote kings of boogie , and in november 1990 a live album from this tour was released called live and kickin ' ( gnp crescendo ) . these well received albums were produced by neil norman who sought out dave 's infectious comedic style . however , by september 1991 , dave walker had had enough of gruelling tours , so he left savoy brown again . donovan 's brain ( 1999-2003 ) . by the late 1990s walker had relocated to bozeman , montana , where in 1999 he met up with an old friend from his san francisco days , ron sanchez , who had ( and still has ) a psychedelic garage band called donovan 's brain , who have an '' open door '' approach to personnel , jamming and making music . consequently , between 1999 and 2003 walker was a member of donovan 's brain ; and during this time he worked on a donovan 's brain session for their tiny crustacean light show album ( originally on get hip records but now on career records ) , in which he did much of the backing vocals and some lead vocals ; a role he also performed on their next album , 2003 's the great leap forward . he also sang on what is now considered to be a rare donovan 's brain track , '' 22 lost marbles '' ( which appeared on a pot by any other name , a free cd with issue 30 ( spring 2001 ) of the independent music magazine ptolemaic terrascope ) , and a brain cover of a song '' the single 2 '' , originally by the band man . this cover appeared on a various-artists man tribute cd man , we 're glad we know you : a tribute to the man band ( originally a private pressing , but now on career records ) . several tracks including walker ; that were left over from the tcls sessions , were released in january 2003 on the donovan 's brain album , the great leap forward ( career records ) . . dave walker band 2 ( 2007–present ) . in 2007 dave walker recorded and released a solo album under his own name . the album , entitled walking underwater , featured guitarist jimmy lewis ; and the working relationship between the two musicians led to dave walker reforming a band under his name , featuring musicians solely from his home city of montana , which has been touring since january 2008 . the line-up of the band consists of walker , lewis , chris cundy ( piano , keyboards , hammond organ ) , eddie tsuru ( bass ) , and mike gillan ( drums ) . the band has made appearances at rockin ' the rivers music festival and magic city blues festival . . other contributions . walker had a band called the pleasure chorizos in his later new mexico days in the early 1990s but ultimately the band did nothing of note . walker played tambourine on a track by the nomads ( who were working in the same studio as donovan 's brain on 24 may 1999 ) called '' top alcohol '' , which was the '' b-side '' to their '' the king of night train '' single ( white jazz records ) . he also recorded backing vocals for one track on a 2003 album by angie pepper . in 2004 , walker also contributed vocals to a cover of i 'm tired , on founder member of savoy brown john o'leary 's album '' sins '' . this album was re-released as '' two for the show '' in 2010 on the acrobat label . in 2005 walker recorded mostly sonny – a tribute to sonny boy williamson on the mooreland street records label . musicians included members of peter green 's splinter group , the kinks , downliners sect ( don craine & keith grant ) and former yardbird ray majors on lead guitar . in addition to which former savoy brown member john o'leary is featured on harmonica . timeline . imagesize width:800 height : auto barincrement:30 plotarea left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:50 alignbars justify dateformat dd/mm/yyyy period from:01/01/1960 till:01/01/2016 timeaxis orientation : horizontal format : yyyy colors id : time value : red legend : tenure legend orientation : horizontal position : bottom scalemajor increment:4 start:1960 bardata bar : caps text : '' the redcaps '' bar : beckett text : '' beckett '' bar : race text : '' the idle race '' bar : brown text : '' savoy brown '' bar : mac text : '' fleetwood mac '' bar : fighter text : '' hungry fighter '' bar : raven text : '' raven '' bar : mistress text : '' mistress '' bar : sabbath text : '' black sabbath '' bar : band text : '' dave walker band '' bar : brain text : '' donovan 's brain '' plotdata width:10 textcolor : black align : left anchor : from shift : ( 10 , -4 ) bar : caps from:01/01/1960 till:30/06/1965 color : time bar : beckett from:01/07/1965 till:31/12/1969 color : time bar : race from:01/01/1970 till:30/06/1971 color : time bar : brown from:01/07/1971 till:31/08/1972 color : time bar : brown from:01/01/1986 till:31/12/1991 color : time bar : mac from:01/09/1972 till:30/06/1973 color : time bar : fighter from:01/01/1974 till:31/12/1974 color : time bar : raven from:01/01/1975 till:30/06/1976 color : time bar : mistress from:01/07/1976 till:31/10/1977 color : time bar : sabbath from:01/11/1977 till:15/01/1978 color : time bar : band from:01/01/1979 till:31/12/1979 color : time bar : band from:01/01/2007 till : end color : time bar : brain from:01/01/1999 till:31/12/2003 color : time . references and notes . external links . dave walker band website dave walker interview at dmme.net , may 2008 savoy brown website dave walker band concert produced by the 11th and grant program for montana pbs
