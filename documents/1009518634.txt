Aroostook War

posses , arrests , and the mobilization of militia . in 1835 the british rescinded their acceptance of the dutch compromise and offered another boundary , which the americans rejected . the united states offered to ask maine to accept the saint john river as the boundary , which the british rejected . in 1836 maine took a special census . penobscot county census representative ebenezer greeley thus began a census of the upper aroostook river territory . governor john harvey of new brunswick had greeley arrested . letters from new brunswick accused the governor of maine of bribery and threatened military action if maine continued to exercise jurisdiction in the basins of the aroostook river and its tributaries . in response , governor robert dunlap of maine issued a general order announcing that a foreign power had invaded maine . in march 1838 the state demanded a survey based on the american claim and that the federal government enforce the claim . washington refused , but did authorize a survey for possible fortifications . the state legislature authorized 800,000 for military defense , and congress gave the president authority to raise the militia with a 10,000,000 budget . meanwhile , nova scotia voted 100,000 in funds to defend new brunswick . both american and new brunswick lumberjacks cut timber in the disputed territory during the winter of 1838–1839 , according to reports submitted to the maine legislature , resulting in the battle of caribou and other conflicts . on 24 january 1839 , the maine legislature authorized the newly elected governor john fairfield to send maine 's land agent , rufus mcintire , the penobscot county sheriff , and a posse of volunteer militia to the upper aroostook to pursue and arrest the new brunswickers . the posse left bangor , maine , on 8 february 1839 . arriving at t10 r5 ( now masardis ) , the posse established a camp at the junction of saint croix stream and the aroostook river and began confiscating new brunswick lumbering equipment , and sending any lumbermen caught and arrested back to maine for trial . a group of new brunswick lumbermen learned of these activities and , unable to retrieve their oxen and horses , broke into the arsenal in woodstock to arm themselves . they gathered their own posse , and seized the maine land agent and his assistants in the middle of the night . this new brunswick posse transported the maine officials in chains to woodstock and held them for an '' interview '' . terming the americans '' political prisoners , '' sir john harvey sent correspondence to washington , dc , that he lacked the authority to act on the arrests without instructions from london , which he awaited . he added that he intended meanwhile to exercise his responsibilities to ensure british jurisdiction over the aroostook , and he demanded removal from the region of all maine forces . he then sent his military commander to the t10 r5 campsite and ordered the maine militia to leave . captain rines and the others refused , stating they were following orders and doing their duty . the maine side then took the new brunswick military commander himself into custody . on 15 february 1839 , the maine legislature authorized militia major general isaac hodsdon to lead 1,000 additional volunteers to augment the posse then on the upper aroostook river . additional correspondence from governor sir john harvey of new brunswick , reports of british army troops arriving from the west indies , reports of the mohawk nation offering their services to quebec , and reports of new brunswick forces gathering on the saint john river resulted in the issuance of general order no 7 on 19 february 1839 , calling for a general draft of maine militia . maine militia companies mustered in bangor and traveled to the upper aroostook until 26 february 1839 , when the early construction of fort fairfield , which the earlier posse built on the aroostook river from seized stolen timber , allowed for camping troops on the eastern boundary . american and british governments step in . during congressional debates in washington on 2 march 1839 , representative francis ormand jonathan smith of maine outlined the events and the various communications sent and received since 1825 . representative smith noted the primary responsibility of the national government to protect and defend its own territory and citizens , but declared that maine would defend its territory alone if the national government chose to not fulfill its obligations . president martin van buren assigned brigadier general winfield scott , then involved in the cherokee removal , to the conflict area ; he arrived in boston in early march 1839 . additional information arriving in washington through april and may 1839 kept congressional debate lively until congress authorized a force of 50,000 men and appropriated 10 & nbsp ; million , placed at the disposal of the president in the event foreign military troops crossed into united states territory during the congressional recess of summer 1839 . the works of james buchanan maine initially committed three thousand to ten thousand militia to the conflict in addition to the land agent 's posse . sir john harvey had supervised winfield scott during his time as prisoner of war during the war of 1812 , and the president and his advisers saw that relationship as a point of mutual respect . pursuant to the terms of the truce for administration within the disputed area , the maine legislature on 6 april 1839 created an armed civil posse . on advice of brigadier general scott , maine issued general orders to recall the militia in may and june 1839 and to replace the militiamen with the armed civil posse . the office of the maine state land agent led the armed civil posse with deputy land agent william parrott at fort fairfield and captain stover rines at camp jarvis on the fish river ( later fort kent , maine ) . the united states army began the permanent structure of fort fairfield in april 1839 and that of fort kent in october 1839 . journal and letterbook of william parrott major r . m . kirby commanded of hancock barracks post near houlton , maine , with three companies of the united states 1st artillery regiment . four companies of the british 11th regiment marched to the area from quebec city to represent canada with the intent to build a suitable barracks across the saint john river from fort kent . new brunswick meanwhile armed every tributary of the saint john river that flowed from the aroostook territory with regular and militia soldiers . in 1840 , maine created aroostook county , maine , to administer the civilian authority of the area . however , reports of collusion resulted in the maine executive council assigning alphus lyons to investigate sheriff packard and district attorney tabor . executive council report on the investigation of the aroostook county sheriff , oct 1840 , maine state archives the two nations agreed to refer the dispute to a boundary commission , but further clashes between their forces continued in the interim . settlement . neither nation wanted a war that would have greatly interfered with the two nations ' trade . daniel webster and alexander baring , 1st baron ashburton , reached a compromise , the webster–ashburton treaty of washington in 1842 , which settled the maine-canada boundary and the boundary between canada and new hampshire , michigan and minnesota . this treaty awarded to the united states and to british control . the british retained the northern area of the disputed territory , including the halifax road with its year-round overland military communications between quebec and nova scotia . the u.s . federal government agreed to pay the states of maine and massachusetts 150,000 each for the loss of the lands of their states and for expenses incurred during the time maine 's armed civil posse administered the truce period . webster used a map that american jared sparks found in the paris archives while searching for pro-american evidence , which benjamin franklin had supposedly marked with a red line , to persuade maine and massachusetts to accept the agreement . the map showed that the disputed region belonged to the british , and so helped convince the representatives of those states to accept the compromise . webster replied to later criticism for hiding the map , '' i did not think it a very urgent duty to go to lord ashburton and tell him that i had found a bit of doubtful evidence in paris . '' ashburton agreed , saying '' my own opinion is that in this respect no reproach can fairly be made . '' the british foreign office , without ashburton 's knowledge , acted similarly by hiding the '' mitchell map '' , which generally supported the american case . some claim that british officials created the franklin map as a fake to pressure the american negotiators . the evidence is that the british map placed the entire disputed area on the american side of the border . john a . garraty , the american nation , houghton mifflin , p . & nbsp ; 336 while lord palmerston and many conservatives in parliament denounced the treaty , the british government was pleased , and conservatives such as benjamin disraeli supported it . similarly , maine and massachusetts complained but were happy to be paid for the loss of territory . canada was unhappy , however , as it viewed the treaty as the british improving relations with the united states by permitting american territory to separate lower canada from the maritimes . keenlyside and brown later wrote '' unjust as such accusations are , it is nevertheless a fact that many canadians still consider the ashburton treaty of 1842 to be the first and most important instance of the loss of canadian rights due to the complacency of great britain and the crooked diplomacy of the united states . '' . casualties . the aroostook war , though without direct combat , did see militiamen die of accident and disease ; for example , private hiram t . smith . in popular culture . the tensions leading up to the aroostook war are referenced in the 1835 short story '' the squatter '' by john neal . the narration of the main character , hayes , voices critical comments on these events from a soldier 's point of view before the conflict came to a head .
