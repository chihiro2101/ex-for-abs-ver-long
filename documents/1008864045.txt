War (American band)

1980s : the music band . in 1979 , following the departure of b.b . dickerson during recording sessions for their next album ( replaced by luther rabb on bass who completed the album ) , the band considered changing their name to the music band , but decided at the last minute to continue as war , and use '' the music band '' as the title of a series of albums . the series originally consisted of two studio albums ( the music band , the music band 2 , both in 1979 ) and a live album ( the music band live , 1980 ) , but after the band left mca in 1981 and had already made records for other labels , mca expanded the series with a compilation ( the best of the music band , 1982 ) and a third original album of left-over material ( the music band – jazz , 1983 ) . the group lost another member when charles miller ( saxophone ) was murdered in 1980 . he had already been replaced by pat rizzo ( ex sly and the family stone ) in 1979 . other new members joining at this time were alice tweed smith ( credited as '' tweed smith '' and '' alice tweed smyth '' on various albums ) on percussion and vocals ( giving the band its first female vocalist ) , and ronnie hammon as a third drummer . after making the one-off single '' cinco de mayo '' for lax records in 1981 ( jerry goldstein 's own label , which also reissued eric burdon declares '' war '' under the title spill the wine the same year ) , war signed with rca records and recorded outlaw ( 1982 ) which included the single plus additional singles '' you got the power '' , '' outlaw '' , and '' just because '' . it was followed by life ( is so strange ) ( 1983 ) from which the title track was also a single . war 's records from 1979 to 1983 were not as successful as those from the preceding decade , and after the two rca albums , the band 's activities became sporadic . they did not record another full album until a decade later . the 1987 compilation album the best of war . and more included two new tracks , '' livin ' in the red '' and '' whose cadillac is that ? '' , and a remixed version of '' low rider '' ( in addition to the original version ) . papa dee allen died of a brain aneurysm which struck him onstage in 1988 . 1990s : reformations . sampling of war by hip hop artists was prevalent enough to merit the compilation album rap declares war in 1992 , which was sanctioned by the band . in 1993 , war reformed with most surviving previous members ( including original members brown , jordan , oskar , and scott , and later members hammon and rizzo ) , augmented by a large line-up of supporting musicians and still under the management and production of jerry goldstein , and released a new album , ☮ in 1994 . in 1996 , the group attempted to gain independence from goldstein , but were unable to do so under the name '' war '' which remains a trademark owned by goldstein and far out productions . in response , brown , oskar , scott , and a returning b.b . dickerson ( who had not worked with war since 1979 ) adopted a name which referenced one of war 's biggest hits : lowrider band . they have yet to record a studio album . lonnie jordan opted to remain with goldstein and create a new version of war with himself as the only original member . some other musicians who had joined between 1983 and 1993 were also part of the new line-up . both the '' new '' war and the lowrider band are currently active as live performance acts . 1996 also saw the release of a double cd compilation , anthology ( 1970–1994 ) , later updated in 2003 with a few track substitutions , as the very best of war . another cd compilation from 1999 , grooves and messages , included a second disc of remixes done by various producers . 21st century . on april 21 , 2008 , eric burdon and lonnie jordan reunited for the first time in 37 years to perform a concert as war at the london royal albert hall . the other original surviving members were not asked to be a part of the reunion . the concert coincided with avenue / rhino records ' eric burdon and war reissues which included eric burdon declares '' war '' and the black-man 's burdon , plus compilations the best of eric burdon and war and anthology . in 2008 , lonnie jordan 's edition of war released a live album / dvd of songs originally from 1969 to 1975 : greatest hits live . war were unsuccessfully nominated for 2009 induction into the rock and roll hall of fame . there were rumours that burdon would join them again in summer 2009 , but it did not happen . in 2011 , war played '' low rider '' and many other hits at the rack n ' roll in stamford , connecticut , with remember september and westchester school of rock . in 2014 the new war released a studio album , evolutionary . also in 2014 , war was a nominee for induction into the rock and roll hall of fame . on
