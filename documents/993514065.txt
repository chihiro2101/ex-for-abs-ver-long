Félix Dupanloup

biography . dupanloup was born at saint-félix , in haute-savoie , an illegitimate son of prince camillo borghese . in his earliest years he was confided to the care of his brother , a priest in the diocese of chambéry . in 1810 he was sent to a pensionnat ecclésiastique at paris . thence he went to the seminary of saint-nicolas-du-chardonnet in 1813 , and was transferred to the seminary of saint sulpice at paris in 1820 . in 1825 he was ordained priest , and was appointed vicar of the madeleine at paris . for a time he was tutor to the orléans princes . he became the founder of a celebrated academy at st hyacinthe , and received a letter from gregory xvi lauding his work there , and calling him apostolus juventutis . he was elected to the académie française in 1854 , king , edward ( 1876 ) .

'oh , madame , ' said the witty bishop , 'please do n't trouble to find a rhyme ; it is not important . ' '' the prince laughed but did not prize the witty word at its real worth . works . image : orléans mausolée monseigneur dupanloup 1.jpg thumb right mgr . dupanloup 's mausoleum in the orléans cathedral , by henri chapu , 1888–1891 .
