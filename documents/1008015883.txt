Coors Brewing Company

history . founding . in 1873 , german immigrants adolph coors and jacob schueler from prussia emigrated to the united states and established a brewery in golden , colorado , after buying a recipe for a pilsner-style beer from a czech immigrant william silhan . coors invested 2,000 in the operation , and schueler invested 18,000 . in 1880 , coors bought out his partner and became sole owner of the brewery . prohibition . the coors brewing company managed to survive prohibition relatively intact . years before the volstead act went into effect nationwide , adolph coors with sons adolph jr . , grover , and herman established the adolph coors brewing and manufacturing company , which included herold porcelain and other ventures . the brewery itself was converted into a malted milk and near beer production facility . coors sold much of the malted milk to the mars candy company for the production of sweets . manna , the company 's non-alcoholic beer replacement , was a near beer similar to current non-alcoholic beverages . however , coors and his sons relied heavily on the porcelain company as well as a cement and real estate company to keep the coors brewing company afloat . by 1933 , after the end of prohibition , the coors brewery was one of only a handful of breweries that had survived . all of the non-brewery assets of the adolph coors company were spun off between 1989 and 1992 . the descendant of the original herold porcelain ceramics business continues to operate as coorstek . . products . for much of its first 100 years of existence , coors beer was marketed solely in the american west . while california and texas were part of the 11-state distribution area , washington and montana were not added until 1976 ( oregon did not approve sales in grocery stores until 1985 ) . this gave it mystique and made it a novelty , particularly on the east coast , and visitors returning from the western states often brought back a case . this iconic status was reflected in the 1977 film smokey and the bandit . the company finally established nationwide distribution in the united states in the mid-1980s . in 1959 , coors became the first american brewer to use an all-aluminum two-piece beverage can . also in 1959 , the company abandoned pasteurization and began to use sterile filtration to stabilize its beer . coors currently operates the largest aluminum can producing plant in the world , known as the rocky mountain metal container ( rmmc ) , in golden . rmmc is a joint venture between ball metal and coors , having been founded in 2003 . in the mid-1970s , coors invented the litter-free push tab can , in place of the ring pull-tab . however , consumers disliked the top and it was discontinued soon afterward . coors light was introduced in 1978 . the longtime slogan of '' silver bullet '' to describe it does not describe the beer , but rather the silver-colored can in which the beer is packaged . coors light was once produced in '' yellow-bellied '' cans like the full-strength coors , but when the yellow coloring was removed and the can was left mostly silver , many dubbed the beer the '' silver bullet '' . change of ownership . on july 22 , 2004 , the adolph coors company , the holding company that owned coors brewing , announced it would be merging with canadian brewing company molson , inc . the merger was completed february 9 , 2005 , with the merged company being named molson coors brewing company . coors brewing company became a subsidiary of the new company . due to the merger , molson coors was rated the third largest producer of beer in the united states , and the second largest brewer in the united kingdom . . brands . coors is responsible for originating a number of alcoholic beverage brands . the most notable of those brands are coors banquet , coors light , and blue moon . controversies . labor problems . in april 1977 , the brewery workers union at coors , representing 1,472 employees , went on strike . the brewery kept operating with supervisors and 250 to 300 union members , including one member of the union executive board who ignored the strike . soon after , coors announced that it would hire replacements for the striking workers . about 700 workers quit the picket line to go back to work , and coors replaced the remaining 500 workers , keeping the beer production process uninterrupted . dana parsons , '' why did strikers return ?
