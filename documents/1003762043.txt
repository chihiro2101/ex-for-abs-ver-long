AES3

history and development . the development of standards for digital audio interconnect for both professional and domestic audio equipment , began in the late 1970s in a joint effort between the audio engineering society and the european broadcasting union , and culminated in the publishing of aes3 in 1985 . the aes3 standard has been revised in 1992 and 2003 and is published in aes and ebu versions . early on , the standard was frequently known as aes/ebu . variants using different physical connections are specified in iec 60958 . these are essentially consumer versions of aes3 for use within the domestic high fidelity environment using connectors more commonly found in the consumer market . these variants are commonly known as s/pdif . hardware connections . the aes3 standard parallels part 4 of the international standard iec 60958 . of the physical interconnection types defined by iec 60958 , two are in common use . iec 60958 type i . thumb type i connections use balanced , 3-conductor , 110-ohm twisted pair cabling with xlr connectors . type i connections are most often used in professional installations and are considered the standard connector for aes3 . the hardware interface is usually implemented using rs-422 line drivers and receivers . two subframes ( a and b , normally used for left and right audio channels ) make a frame . frames contain 64 bit periods and are produced once per audio sample period . at the highest level , each 192 consecutive frames are grouped into an audio block . while samples repeat each frame time , metadata is only transmitted once per audio block . at 48 & nbsp ; khz sample rate , there are 250 audio blocks per second , and 3,072,000 time slots per second supported by a 6.144 & nbsp ; mhz biphase clock . . synchronisation preamble . the synchronisation preamble is a specially coded preamble that identifies the subframe and its position within the audio block . preambles are not normal bmc-encoded data bits , although they do still have zero dc bias . three preambles are possible : x ( or m ) : 11100010 if previous time slot was 0 , 00011101 if it was 1 . ( equivalently , 10010011 nrzi encoded . ) marks a word for channel a ( left ) , other than at the start of an audio block . y ( or w ) : 11100100 if previous time slot was 0 , 00011011 if it was 1 . ( equivalently , 10010110 nrzi encoded . ) marks a word for channel b ( right ) . z ( or b ) : 11101000 if previous time slot was 0 , 00010111 if it was 1 . ( equivalently , 10011100 nrzi encoded . ) marks a word for channel a ( left ) at the start of an audio block . the three preambles are called x , y , z in the aes3 standard ; and m , w , b in iec 958 ( an aes extension ) . the 8-bit preambles are transmitted in the time allocated to the first four time slots of each subframe ( time slots 0 to 3 ) . any of the three marks the beginning of a subframe . x or z marks the beginning of a frame , and z marks the beginning of an audio block . 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 time slots _____ _ _____ _ / \_____/ \_/ \_____/ \_/ \ preamble x _____ _ ___ ___ / \___/ \___/ \_____/ \_/ \ preamble y _____ _ _ _____ / \_/ \_____/ \_____/ \_/ \ preamble z ___ ___ ___ ___ / \___/ \___/ \___/ \___/ \ all 0 bits bmc encoded _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ / \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \ all 1 bits bmc encoded 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 time slots in two-channel aes3 , the preambles form a pattern of zyxyxyxy… , but it is straightforward to extend this structure to additional channels ( more subframes per frame ) , each with a y preamble , as is done in the madi protocol . channel status word . there is one channel status bit in each subframe , a total of 192 bits or 24 bytes for each channel in each block . between the aes3 and s/pdif standards , the contents of the 192-bit channel status word differ significantly , although they agree that the first channel status bit distinguishes between the two . in the case of aes3 , the standard describes , in detail , the function of each bit . byte 0 : basic control data : sample rate , compression , emphasis bit 0 : a value of 1 indicates this is aes3 channel status data . 0 indicates this is s/pdif data . bit 1 : a value of 0 indicates this is linear audio pcm data . a value of 1 indicates other ( usually non-audio ) data . bits 2–4 : indicates the type of signal preemphasis applied to the data . generally set to 100 ( none ) . bit 5 : a value of 0 indicates that the source is locked to some ( unspecified ) external time sync . a value of 1 indicates an unlocked source . bits 6–7 : sample rate . these bits are redundant when real-time audio is transmitted ( the receiver can observe the sample rate directly ) , but are useful if aes3 data is recorded or otherwise stored . options are unspecified , 48 & nbsp ; khz ( the default ) , 44.1 & nbsp ; khz , and 32 & nbsp ; khz . additional sample rate options may be indicated in the extended sample rate field ( see below ) . byte 1 : indicates if the audio stream is stereo , mono or some other combination . bits 0–3 : indicates the relationship of the two channels ; they might be unrelated audio data , a stereo pair , duplicated mono data , music and voice commentary , a stereo sum/difference code . bits 4–7 : used to indicate the format of the user channel word byte 2 : audio word length bits 0–2 : aux bits usage . this indicates how the aux bits ( time slots 4–7 ) are used . generally set to 000 ( unused ) or 001 ( used for 24-bit audio data ) . bits 3–5 : word length . specifies the sample size , relative to the 20- or 24-bit maximum . can specify 0 , 1 , 2 or 4 missing bits . unused bits are filled with 0 , but audio processing functions such as mixing will generally fill them in with valid data without changing the effective word length . bits 6–7 : unused byte 3 : used only for multichannel applications byte 4 : additional sample rate information bits 0–1 : indicates the grade of the sample rate reference , per aes11 bit 2 : reserved bits 3–6 : extended sample rate . this indicates other sample rates , not representable in byte 0 bits 6–7 . values are assigned for 24 , 96 , and 192 & nbsp ; khz , as well as 22.05 , 88.2 , and 176.4 & nbsp ; khz . bit 7 : sampling frequency scaling flag . if set , indicates that the sample rate is multiplied by 1/1.001 to match ntsc video frame rates . byte 5 : reserved bytes 6–9 : four ascii characters for indicating channel origin . widely used in large studios . bytes 10–13 : four ascii characters indicating channel destination , to control automatic switchers . less often used . bytes 14–17 : 32-bit sample address , incrementing block-to-block by 192 ( because there are 192 frames per block ) . at 48 & nbsp ; khz , this wraps approximately every day . bytes 18–21 : 32-bit sample address offset to indicate samples since midnight . byte 22 : channel status word reliability indication bits 0–3 : reserved bit 4 : if set , bytes 0–5 ( signal format ) are unreliable . bit 5 : if set , bytes 6–13 ( channel labels ) are unreliable . bit 6 : if set , bytes 14–17 ( sample address ) are unreliable . bit 7 : if set , bytes 18–21 ( timestamp ) are unreliable . byte 23 : crc . this byte is used to detect corruption of the channel status word , as might be caused by switching mid-block . embedded timecode . smpte timecode data can be embedded within aes3 signals . it can be used for synchronization and for logging and identifying audio content . it is embedded as a 32-bit binary word in bytes 18 to 21 of the channel status data . the aes11 standard provides information on the synchronization of digital audio structures . the aes52 standard describes how to insert unique identifiers into an aes3 bit stream . . smpte 2110-31 : aes3 transmission over an ip network . smpte 2110-31 defines how to encapsulate an aes3 data stream in real-time transport protocol packets for transmission over an ip network using the smpte 2110 ip based multicast framework . . other formats . aes3 digital audio format can also be carried over an asynchronous transfer mode network . the standard for packing aes3 frames into atm cells is aes47 . see also . adat lightpipemultichannel optical digital audio interface . notes . references . further reading . . external links . download page for aes standards european broadcasting union , specification of the digital audio interface ( the aes/ebu interface ) tech 3250-e third edition ( 2004 )
