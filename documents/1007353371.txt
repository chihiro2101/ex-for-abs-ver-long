Manning

origin and meaning . manning is from an old norse word & nbsp ; — manningi & nbsp ; — meaning a brave or valiant man ; and one of the first forms of the name was mannin ; another cartography was mannygn . one historian gives a saxon origin for the family , which he calls '' ancient and noble '' . according to him , manning was the name of a town in saxony , and from it the surname sprang . other historians make mannheim , germany , the cradle of the family , and begin its history with ranulph , or rudolph de manning , count palatine , who , having married elgida , aunt to king harold i of england , had a grant of land in kent , england . his name is also written de mannheim & nbsp ; — rudolph de mannheim . his place in kent was downe court , and there the mannings have been a power ever since . simon de manning , a grandson of rudolph , was the first of the english barons to take up the cross and go forth to the holy wars . he was a companion of richard i of england , and was knighted on the battlefield . he was lord of the manor of kevington , and the area now called berry 's green . we can easily see where the cross of the coat of arms comes from . at downe court these arms are seen graven upon tombstones of the mannings . by the thirteenth century the family was well represented in over a score of countries and several towns bear their name & nbsp ; — manningham , bradford , and mannington , norfolk . the surname manning is also an english patronymic name , being one of those names derived from the first name of a father . in this case it is derived from the old english personal name manning and simply denotes 'son of manning ' , while manning itself may derive from the old norse name menning , meaning 'able ' . early recorded english instances of the name includes a reference to one mannicus in the domesday book of 1086 and algarus manningestepsune in 1130 , mentioned in ekwall 's '' early london personal names '' . seaman lilius manning appears in the pipe rolls for essex in 1181 and ainulf manning in the pipe rolls for kent in 1190 . the surname manning is on the record in ireland from the seventeenth century and is most numerous today in the counties cork and dublin . although it is essentially an english surname , manning has occasionally been used as a synonym of the gaelic surname ó mainnín and that , for example , cornet john manning of o'neill 's dragons in king james ii 's irish army , was an ó mainnín . others trace the origins of the name to ireland : ó mainnín ( anglicized mannion ) is the name of a galway family who were formerly chiefs of soghain ( in what is now ireland ) , a district nearly co-extensive with the barony of tiaquin . ó mainnín , king of soghain , is mentioned in the chronicon scotorum in the year 1135 , and a latter chief died at the second battle of athenry in 1316 . they continued to form a distinct clan down to the time of james i of england . the chief resided at menlough castle , in the parish of killascobe , galway . in 1617 , aedh ó mainnín ( hugh o'mannin ) surrendered his estates , but a small portion of it was restored under the act of settlement in 1676 where the name is still common in galway and roscommon , and has spread into other parts of ireland . . people . al g . manning ( 1927–2006 ) , american occultist anne manning ( racewalker ) ( born 1959 ) , australian racewalker aubrey manning ( 1930–2018 ) , english zoologist and broadcaster barbara manning ( born 1964 ) , american indie rock musician bernard manning ( 1930–2007 ) , british comedian blanche m . manning ( 1934-2020 ) , american judge brandon manning ( born 1990 ) , canadian professional ice hockey player brennan manning , born richard francis xavier manning , ( 1934–2013 ) , american author of the ragamuffin gospel brian manning ( disambiguation ) , several people including : : brian manning ( historian ) ( 1927–2004 ) , british historian : brian g . w . manning ( 1926–2011 ) , british astronomer : brian manning ( american football ) ( born 1975 ) , american football wide receiver : brian manning ( trade unionist and activist ) ( 1932–2013 ) , australian activist caroline joyce manning ( 1909–2000 ) , british campaigner catherine lemmon manning ( 1881–1957 ) , of washington , d.c . chelsea manning ( born 1987 ) , u.s . army intelligence analyst , convicted of leaking classified materials to wikileaks clarence manning ( 1893–1972 ) , u.s . slavicist daniel manning ( 1831–1887 ) , u.s . secretary of the treasury under cleveland david manning ( born 1949 ) , british diplomat dick manning ( 1912–1991 ) , american songwriter don manning ( politician ) ( 1965–2020 ) , american politician dorothy manning ( 1919–2012 ) , new zealand artist emily manning ( 1845–1890 ) , an australian journalist and writer ernest manning ( 1908–1996 ) , a canadian politician edward manning ( disambiguation ) elizabeth manning ( disambiguation ) frankie manning ( born 1914 ) , american dancer frederic manning ( 1882–1935 ) , australian poet and novelist geoff manning ( 1926–2018 ) , south australian historian marie manning ( murderer ) ( died 1849 ) , british murderer guy manning , british musician henry manning ( disambiguation ) , several people including : henry manning ( spy ) , spy in the exiled court of charles ii at cologne and brussels : henry manning ( politician ) ( 1877–1963 ) , australian lawyer and politician : henry edward manning ( 1808–1892 ) , english roman catholic archbishop of westminster : henry j . manning ( 1859– ? ) , u.s . navy sailor and medal of honor recipient hugh manning ( 1920–2004 ) , british actor jack manning ( actor ) ( 1916–2009 ) , american actor james david manning ( born 1947 ) , american pastor jeff manning , ( born 1971 ) , american author and entrepreneur jessie wilson manning ( 1855– ) , american author and lecturer john manning ( disambiguation ) , several people including : : john manning , co-founder of the atlantic brass quintet : john manning jr .
