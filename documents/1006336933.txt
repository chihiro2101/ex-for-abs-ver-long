Porphyrin

complexes of porphyrins . file : porphyrin.svg porphin is the simplest porphyrin , a rare compound of theoretical interest . file : ppixtransh.png derivatives of protoporphyrin ix are common in nature , the precursor to hemes . file : h2octaethylporphyrin.png octaethylporphyrin ( h 2 oep ) is a synthetic analogue of protoporphyrin ix . unlike the natural porphyrin ligands , oep 2− is highly symmetrical . file : h2tpp.png tetraphenylporphyrin ( h 2 tpp ) is another synthetic analogue of protoporphyrin ix . unlike the natural porphyrin ligands , tpp 2− is highly symmetrical . another difference is that its methyne centers are occupied by phenyl groups . file : heme b.svg simplified view of heme , a complex of a protoporphyrin ix . porphyrins are the conjugate acids of ligands that bind metals to form complexes . the metal ion usually has a charge of 2+ or 3+ . a schematic equation for these syntheses is shown : : h 2 porphyrin + ml n 2+ → m ( porphyrinate ) l n−4 + 4 l + 2 h + , where m metal ion and l a ligand a porphyrin without a metal-ion in its cavity is a free base . some iron-containing porphyrins are called hemes . heme-containing proteins , or hemoproteins , are found extensively in nature . hemoglobin and myoglobin are two oxygen-binding proteins that contain iron porphyrins . various cytochromes are also hemoproteins . related species . a benzoporphyrin is a porphyrin with a benzene ring fused to one of the pyrrole units . e.g . verteporfin is a benzoporphyrin derivative . several other heterocycles are related to porphyrins . these include corrins , chlorins , bacteriochlorophylls , and corphins . chlorins ( 2,3-dihydroporphyrin ) are more reduced , contain more hydrogen than porphyrins , i.e . one pyrrole has been converted to a pyrroline . this structure occurs in chlorophylls . replacement of two of the four pyrrolic subunits with pyrrolinic subunits results in either a bacteriochlorin ( as found in some photosynthetic bacteria ) or an isobacteriochlorin , depending on the relative positions of the reduced rings . some porphyrin derivatives follow hückel 's rule , but most do not . natural formation . a geoporphyrin , also known as a petroporphyrin , is a porphyrin of geologic origin . they can occur in crude oil , oil shale , coal , or sedimentary rocks . abelsonite is possibly the only geoporphyrin mineral , as it is rare for porphyrins to occur in isolation and form crystals . . synthesis . biosynthesis . in non-photosynthetic eukaryotes such as animals , insects , fungi , and protozoa , as well as the α-proteobacteria group of bacteria , the committed step for porphyrin biosynthesis is the formation of aminolevulinic acid ( δ-ala , 5-ala or dala ) by the reaction of the amino acid glycine with succinyl-coa from the citric acid cycle . in plants , algae , bacteria ( except for the α-proteobacteria group ) and archaea , it is produced from glutamic acid via glutamyl-trna and glutamate-1-semialdehyde . the enzymes involved in this pathway are glutamyl-trna synthetase , glutamyl-trna reductase , and glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase . this pathway is known as the c5 or beale pathway . two molecules of dala are then combined by porphobilinogen synthase to give porphobilinogen ( pbg ) , which contains a pyrrole ring . four pbgs are then combined through deamination into hydroxymethyl bilane ( hmb ) , which is hydrolysed to form the circular tetrapyrrole uroporphyrinogen iii . this molecule undergoes a number of further modifications . intermediates are used in different species to form particular substances , but , in humans , the main end-product protoporphyrin ix is combined with iron to form heme . bile pigments are the breakdown products of heme . the following scheme summarizes the biosynthesis of porphyrins , with references by ec number and the omim database . the porphyria associated with the deficiency of each enzyme is also shown : . laboratory synthesis . image :

porphyrins is the rothemund reaction , first reported in 1936 , which is also the basis for more recent methods described by adler and longo . the general scheme is a condensation and oxidation process starting with pyrrole and an aldehyde . :400px . isomeric porphyrins . the first synthetic porphyrin isomer was reported by emanual vogel and coworkers in 1986 . this isomer 18porphyrin- ( 2.0.2.0 ) is named as porphycene , and the central n 4 cavity forms a rectangle shape as shown in figure . porphycenes showed interesting photophysical behavior and found versatile compound towards the photodynamic therapy . this inspired vogel and sessler to took up the challenge of preparing 18porphyrin- ( 2.1.0.1 ) and named it as corrphycene or porphycerin . the third porphyrin that is 18porphyrin- ( 2.1.1.0 ) , was reported by callot and vogel-sessler . vogel and coworkers reported successful isolation of 18porphyrin- ( 3.0.1.0 ) or isoporphycene . the japanese scientist furuta and polish scientist latos-grażyński almost simultaneously reported the n-confused porphyrins . the inversion of one of the pyrrolic subunits in the macrocyclic ring resulted to face one of the nitrogen atom outside of the core of the macrocycle . applications . photodynamic therapy . porphyrins have been evaluated in the context of photodynamic therapy ( pdt ) since they strongly absorb light , which is then converted to energy and heat in the illuminated areas . this technique has been applied in macular degeneration using verteporfin . pdt is considered a noninvasive cancer treatment , involving the interaction between light of a determined frequency , a photo-sensitizer , and oxygen . this interaction produces the formation of a highly reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , usually singlet oxygen , as well as superoxide anion , free hydroxyl radical , or hydrogen peroxide . price , m . , terlecky , s . r . and kessel , d .
