Fields of the Nephilim

career . early years ( 1984–1991 ) . fields of the nephilim 's initial sound incorporated elements of hard rock , gothic rock , heavy metal and psychedelic rock , and comprised a bass and guitar driven sound underpinned by mccoy 's death growl . lyrically , the band incorporated themes concerning magic ( specifically chaos magic ) , the cthulhu mythos , the sumerian religion , and the works of aleister crowley . the band had a '' dust and death '' image , associated with characters from sergio leone 's spaghetti westerns and often wore cowboy dusters with a weather-beaten look during photoshoots . this weather-beaten look was attained by dusting themselves down with , by their own admission , mother 's pride flour . this also proved problematic for the band as in may 1988 , nottinghamshire police detained the band whilst a suspect substance was tested for drugs . this was later determined to be nothing but flour from the stage set . their debut ep , burning the fields , was released in 1985 by situation two records ( an imprint of beggars banquet records ) . the band '' upgraded '' to beggars banquet in 1986 to release '' power '' and '' preacher man '' , and their first album , dawnrazor which topped the indie chart in 1987 . the next release , '' blue water '' , was the first fields of the nephilim single to reach the uk charts ( 75 ) . it was followed by '' moonchild '' , lead single from the second lp the nephilim which reached number 28 in the uk charts . psychonaut was released in may 1989 and peaked at number 35 ; the ten-minute track indicated a slight shift for the band toward a more experimental and intense sound . this single/ep was a precursor for the polished and highly produced elizium album ( 1990 ) . produced by pink floyd / david gilmour engineer andy jackson ( taking over from previous band producer bill buchanan ) , the album was preceded by the single '' for her light '' , which clipped the british top 40 in its first week of release . a remixed version of '' sumerland ( dreamed ) '' , released in november 1990 , peaked at number 37 . in 1991 , the band played their final gigs , a two-day 'festival of fire ' in london . the final releases of this era are the live cd earth inferno and video visionary heads , followed by the compilation revelations . departure of mccoy and hiatus ( 1991–1998 ) . frontman mccoy left the band in 1991 . the remaining members , together with singer andy delaney , chose not to continue with the '' fields of the nephilim '' name and recorded instead under the name rubicon . the band released two albums before disbanding : what starts , ends in 1992 and room 101 in 1995 . meanwhile , mccoy formed a new group called nefilim with john 'capachino ' carter in 1991 after the disbanding of fields of the nephilim . it featured mccoy on vocals and multi-instrumentalist carter on bass , guitars and drums . the title track zoon was written during this period as were demos including 'red harvest777 , chaochracy & subsanity ( sensorium ) . after a year carter and mccoy parted company . mccoy later recruited paul miles on guitar , simon rippin on drums and cian houchin on bass . the band played some gigs in 1993 , showcasing some new material . according to mccoy , carl mccoy in orkus magazine , 1998 , mentioning the album '' could have appeared four years earlier '' . accessed through sumerland on 28 july 2009 . the release of their debut album , zoon , was delayed for several years due to disagreements with the record label . zoon was eventually released in 1996 and featured a distinctly heavier sound than mccoy 's previous works . reunion and new album ( 1998–2002 ) . on 15 august 1998 , mccoy and original bassist tony pettitt held a press conference at the zillo festival in germany , announcing their future plans to collaborate under two separate monikers , fields of the nephilim ( along with the wright brothers ) and the nephilim ( an altered spelling of mccoy 's solo project ) . according to different original band members , the band was rehearsing and writing the next fields of the nephilim album ( with the exception of yates ) . however , the awaited reunion of the original band line-up never happened . in may 2000 , mccoy released '' one more nightmare ( trees come down ) '' , the first fields of the nephilim single with their new label , jungle records . it contained newly worked versions of '' trees come down '' and '' darkcell , '' both originally released on the burning the fields ep in 1984 . between june and august 2000 , the band made four live appearances at european festivals , ( now featuring former nefilim members rippin and miles ) , at woodstage , eurorock , roskilde and m'era luna music festivals . in 2002 , jungle records and metropolis records released the first fields of the nephilim studio album since elizium , entitled fallen . the release was not authorised by the band , and consists of unfinished recordings from 1997–2001 , the 2000 reworkings of '' trees come down '' and '' darkcell '' , and a previously unreleased demo by the nefilim . the release was disowned by the band for many years , and only one song from it , '' from the fire , '' has been performed live . mourning sun and ceromonies ( 2005–2008 ) . fifteen years after elizium , mccoy released mourning sun , his fourth full-length studio album under the name fields of the nephilim . the album had seven original songs , with a cover version of zager and evans 's '' in the year 2525 '' included as a bonus track on the
