however , it is generally impractical to produce and maintain bulk material in a defect-free state outside of laboratory conditions . . production . the process of manufacturing fiberglass is called pultrusion . the manufacturing process for glass fibers suitable for reinforcement uses large furnaces to gradually melt the silica sand , limestone , kaolin clay , fluorspar , colemanite , dolomite and other minerals until a liquid forms . it is then extruded through bushings , which are bundles of very small orifices ( typically 5–25 micrometres in diameter for e-glass , 9 micrometres for s-glass ) . these filaments are then sized ( coated ) with a chemical solution . the individual filaments are now bundled in large numbers to provide a roving . the diameter of the filaments , and the number of filaments in the roving , determine its weight , typically expressed in one of two measurement systems : yield , or yards per pound ( the number of yards of fiber in one pound of material ; thus a smaller number means a heavier roving ) . examples of standard yields are 225yield , 450yield , 675yield . tex , or grams per km ( how many grams 1 & nbsp ; km of roving weighs , inverted from yield ; thus a smaller number means a lighter roving ) . examples of standard tex are 750tex , 1100tex , 2200tex . these rovings are then either used directly in a composite application such as pultrusion , filament winding ( pipe ) , gun roving ( where an automated gun chops the glass into short lengths and drops it into a jet of resin , projected onto the surface of a mold ) , or in an intermediary step , to manufacture fabrics such as chopped strand mat ( csm ) ( made of randomly oriented small cut lengths of fiber all bonded together ) , woven fabrics , knit fabrics or unidirectional fabrics . chopped strand mat . chopped strand mat or csm is a form of reinforcement used in fiberglass . it consists of glass fibers laid randomly across each other and held together by a binder . it is typically processed using the hand lay-up technique , where sheets of material are placed on a mold and brushed with resin . because the binder dissolves in resin , the material easily conforms to different shapes when wetted out . after the resin cures , the hardened product can be taken from the mold and finished . using chopped strand mat gives the fiberglass isotropic in-plane material properties . sizing . a coating or primer is applied to the roving to : help protect the glass filaments for processing and manipulation . ensure proper bonding to the resin matrix , thus allowing for the transfer of shear loads from the glass fibers to the thermoset plastic . without this bonding , the fibers can 'slip ' in the matrix , causing localized failure . . properties . an individual structural glass fiber is both stiff and strong in tension and compression—that is , along its axis . although it might be assumed that the fiber is weak in compression , it is actually only the long aspect ratio of the fiber which makes it seem so ; i.e . , because a typical fiber is long and narrow , it buckles easily . on the other hand , the glass fiber is weak in shear—that is , across its axis . therefore , if a collection of fibers can be arranged permanently in a preferred direction within a material , and if they can be prevented from buckling in compression , the material will be preferentially strong in that direction . furthermore , by laying multiple layers of fiber on top of one another , with each layer oriented in various preferred directions , the material 's overall stiffness and strength can be efficiently controlled . in fiberglass , it is the plastic matrix which permanently constrains the structural glass fibers to directions chosen by the designer . with chopped strand mat , this directionality is essentially an entire two-dimensional plane ; with woven fabrics or unidirectional layers , directionality of stiffness and strength can be more precisely controlled within the plane . a fiberglass component is typically of a thin '' shell '' construction , sometimes filled on the inside with structural foam , as in the case of surfboards . the component may be of nearly arbitrary shape , limited only by the complexity and tolerances of the mold used for manufacturing the shell . the mechanical functionality of materials is heavily reliant on the combined performances of both the resin ( aka matrix ) and fibers . for example , in severe temperature conditions ( over 180 & nbsp ; °c ) , the resin component of the composite may lose its functionality , partially due to bond deterioration of resin and fiber . however , gfrps can still show significant residual strength after experiencing high temperatures ( 200 & nbsp ; °c ) . . types of glass fiber used . composition : the most common types of glass fiber used in fiberglass is e-glass , which is alumino-borosilicate glass with less than 1 % w/w alkali oxides , mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics . other types of glass used are a-glass ( alkali-lime glass with little or no boron oxide ) , e-cr-glass ( electrical/chemical resistance ; alumino-lime silicate with less than 1 % w/w alkali oxides , with high acid resistance ) , c-glass ( alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content , used for glass staple fibers and insulation ) , d-glass ( borosilicate glass , named for its low dielectric constant ) , r-glass ( alumino silicate glass without mgo and cao with high mechanical requirements as reinforcement ) , and s-glass ( alumino silicate glass without cao but with high mgo content with high tensile strength ) . naming and use : pure silica ( silicon dioxide ) , when cooled as fused quartz into a glass with no true melting point , can be used as a glass fiber for fiberglass but has the drawback that it must be worked at very high temperatures . in order to lower the necessary work temperature , other materials are introduced as '' fluxing agents '' ( i.e . , components to lower the melting point ) . ordinary a-glass ( '' a '' for '' alkali-lime '' ) or soda lime glass , crushed and ready to be remelted , as so-called cullet glass , was the first type of glass used for fiberglass . e-glass ( '' e '' because of initial electrical application ) , is alkali-free and was the first glass formulation used for continuous filament formation . it now makes up most of the fiberglass production in the world , and also is the single largest consumer of boron minerals globally . it is susceptible to chloride ion attack and is a poor choice for marine applications . s-glass ( '' s '' for '' stiff '' ) is used when tensile strength ( high modulus ) is important and is thus an important building and aircraft epoxy composite ( it is called r-glass , '' r '' for '' reinforcement '' in europe ) . c-glass ( '' c '' for '' chemical resistance '' ) and t-glass ( '' t '' is for '' thermal insulator '' —a north american variant of c-glass ) are resistant to chemical attack ; both are often found in insulation-grades of blown fiberglass . . table of some common fiberglass types . . applications . fiberglass is an immensely versatile material due to its lightweight , inherent strength , weather-resistant finish and variety of surface textures . the development of fiber-reinforced plastic for commercial use was extensively researched in the 1930s . it was of particular interest to the aviation industry . a means of mass production of glass strands was accidentally discovered in 1932 when a researcher at owens-illinois directed a jet of compressed air at a stream of molten glass and produced fibers . after owens merged with the corning company in 1935 , owens corning adapted the method to produce its patented '' fiberglas '' ( one '' s '' ) . a suitable resin for combining the '' fiberglas '' with a plastic was developed in 1936 by du pont . the first ancestor of modern polyester resins is cyanamid 's of 1942 . peroxide curing systems were used by then . during world war ii , fiberglass was developed as a replacement for the molded plywood used in aircraft radomes ( fiberglass being transparent to microwaves ) . its first main civilian application was for the building of boats and sports car bodies , where it gained acceptance in the 1950s . its use has broadened to the automotive and sport equipment sectors . in the production of some products , such as aircraft , carbon fiber is now used instead of fiberglass , which is stronger by volume and weight . advanced manufacturing techniques such as pre-pregs and fiber rovings extend fiberglass 's applications and the tensile strength possible with fiber-reinforced plastics . fiberglass is also used in the telecommunications industry for shrouding antennas , due to its rf permeability and low signal attenuation properties . it may also be used to conceal other equipment where no signal permeability is required , such as equipment cabinets and steel support structures , due to the ease with which it can be molded and painted to blend with existing structures and surfaces . other uses include sheet-form electrical insulators and structural components commonly found in power-industry products . because of fiberglass 's lightweight and durability , it is often used in protective equipment such as helmets . many sports use fiberglass protective gear , such as goaltenders ' and catchers ' masks . storage tanks . storage tanks can be made of fiberglass with capacities up to about 300 tonnes . smaller tanks can be made with chopped strand mat cast over a thermoplastic inner tank which acts as a preform during construction . much more reliable tanks are made using woven mat or filament wound fiber , with the fiber orientation at right angles to the hoop stress imposed in the sidewall by the contents . such tanks tend to be used for chemical storage because the plastic liner ( often polypropylene ) is resistant to a wide range of corrosive chemicals . fiberglass is also used for septic tanks . house building . glass-reinforced plastics are also used to produce house building components such as roofing laminate , door surrounds , over-door canopies , window canopies and dormers , chimneys , coping systems , and heads with keystones and sills . the material 's reduced weight and easier handling , compared to wood or metal , allows faster installation . mass-produced fiberglass brick-effect panels can be used in the construction of composite housing , and can include insulation to reduce heat loss . oil and gas artificial lift systems . in rod pumping applications , fiberglass rods are often used for their high tensile strength to weight ratio . fiberglass rods provide an advantage over steel rods because they stretch more elastically ( lower young 's modulus ) than steel for a given weight , meaning more oil can be lifted from the hydrocarbon reservoir to the surface with each stroke , all while reducing the load on the pumping unit . fiberglass rods must be kept in tension , however , as they frequently part if placed in even a small amount of compression . the buoyancy of the rods within a fluid amplifies this tendency . piping . grp and gre pipe can be used in a variety of above- and below-ground systems , including those for : desalination water treatment water distribution networks chemical process plants water used for firefighting hot and cold water drinking water wastewater/sewage , municipal waste liquified petroleum gas . examples of fiberglass use . thumb diy bows / youth recurve ;

often the mandrel is placed in an oven to achieve this , though sometimes radiant heaters are used with the mandrel still turning in the machine . once the resin has cured , the mandrel is removed , leaving the hollow final product . for some products such as gas bottles , the 'mandrel ' is a permanent part of the finished product forming a liner to prevent gas leakage or as a barrier to protect the composite from the fluid to be stored . filament winding is well suited to automation , and there are many applications , such as pipe and small pressure vessels that are wound and cured without any human intervention . the controlled variables for winding are fiber type , resin content , wind angle , tow or bandwidth and thickness of the fiber bundle . the angle at which the fiber has an effect on the properties of the final product . a high angle '' hoop '' will provide circumferential or '' burst '' strength , while lower angle patterns ( polar or helical ) will provide greater longitudinal tensile strength . products currently being produced using this technique range from pipes , golf clubs , reverse osmosis membrane housings , oars , bicycle forks , bicycle rims , power and transmission poles , pressure vessels to missile casings , aircraft fuselages and lamp posts and yacht masts . fiberglass hand lay-up operation . a release agent , usually in either wax or liquid form , is applied to the chosen mold to allow the finished product to be cleanly removed from the mold . resin—typically a 2-part thermoset polyester , vinyl , or epoxy—is mixed with its hardener and applied to the surface . sheets of fiberglass matting are laid into the mold , then more resin mixture is added using a brush or roller . the material must conform to the mold , and air must not be trapped between the fiberglass and the mold . additional resin is applied and possibly additional sheets of fiberglass . hand pressure , vacuum or rollers are used to be sure the resin saturates and fully wets all layers , and that any air pockets are removed . the work must be done quickly before the resin starts to cure unless high-temperature resins are used which will not cure until the part is warmed in an oven . in some cases , the work is covered with plastic sheets and vacuum is drawn on the work to remove air bubbles and press the fiberglass to the shape of the mold . . fiberglass spray lay-up operation . the fiberglass spray lay-up process is similar to the hand lay-up process but differs in the application of the fiber and resin to the mold . spray-up is an open-molding composites fabrication process where resin and reinforcements are sprayed onto a mold . the resin and glass may be applied separately or simultaneously '' chopped '' in a combined stream from a chopper gun . workers roll out the spray-up to compact the laminate . wood , foam or other core material may then be added , and a secondary spray-up layer imbeds the core between the laminates . the part is then cured , cooled , and removed from the reusable mold . pultrusion operation . image : pultrusion process 01.png thumb 300px right diagram of the pultrusion process pultrusion is a manufacturing method used to make strong , lightweight composite materials . in pultrusion , material is pulled through forming machinery using either a hand-over-hand method or a continuous-roller method ( as opposed to extrusion , where the material is pushed through dies ) . in fiberglass pultrusion , fibers ( the glass material ) are pulled from spools through a device that coats them with a resin . they are then typically heat-treated and cut to length . fiberglass produced this way can be made in a variety of shapes and cross-sections , such as w or s cross-sections . warping . one notable feature of fiberglass is that the resins used are subject to contraction during the curing process . for polyester this contraction is often 5–6 % ; for epoxy , about 2 % . because the fibers do not contract , this differential can create changes in the shape of the part during curing . distortions can appear hours , days , or weeks after the resin has set . while this distortion can be minimised by symmetric use of the fibers in the design , a certain amount of internal stress is created ; and if it becomes too great , cracks form . health hazards . in june 2011 , the national toxicology program ( ntp ) removed from its report on carcinogens all biosoluble glass wool used in home and building insulation and for non-insulation products . however , ntp considers fibrous glass dust to be '' reasonably anticipated as a human carcinogen ( certain glass wool fibers ( inhalable ) ) '' . similarly , california 's office of environmental health hazard assessment ( '' oehha '' ) published a november , 2011 modification to its proposition 65 listing to include only '' glass wool fibers ( inhalable and biopersistent ) . '' 46-z california regulatory notice register , p.1878 ( november 18 , 2011 ) . the actions of u.s . ntp and california 's oehha mean that a cancer warning label for biosoluble fiber glass home and building insulation is no longer required under federal or california law . all fiberglass wools commonly used for thermal and acoustical insulation were reclassified by the international agency for research on cancer ( iarc ) in october 2001 as not classifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans ( group 3 ) . people can be exposed to fiberglass in the workplace by breathing it in , skin contact , or eye contact . the occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) has set the legal limit ( permissible exposure limit ) for fiberglass exposure in the workplace as 15 & nbsp ; mg/m 3 total and 5 & nbsp ; mg/m 3 in respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday . the national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) has set a recommended exposure limit ( rel ) of 3 fibers/cm 3 ( less than 3.5 micrometers in diameter and greater than 10 micrometers in length ) as a time-weighted average over an 8-hour workday , and a 5 & nbsp ; mg/m 3 total limit . the european union and germany classify synthetic vitreous fibers as possibly or probably carcinogenic , but fibers can be exempt from this classification if they pass specific tests . evidence for these classifications is primarily from studies on experimental animals and mechanisms of carcinogenesis . the glass wool epidemiology studies have been reviewed by a panel of international experts convened by the iarc . these experts concluded : '' epidemiologic studies published during the 15 years since the previous iarc monographs review of these fibers in 1988 provide no evidence of increased risks of lung cancer or mesothelioma ( cancer of the lining of the body cavities ) from occupational exposures during the manufacture of these materials , and inadequate evidence overall of any cancer risk . '' a 2012 health hazard review for the european commission stated that inhalation of fiberglass at concentrations of 3 , 16 and 30 mg/m3 '' did not induce fibrosis nor tumours except transient lung inflammation that disappeared after a post-exposure recovery period . '' similar reviews of the epidemiology studies have been conducted by the agency for toxic substances and disease registry ( '' atsdr '' ) , the national toxicology program , charles william jameson , '' comments on the national toxicology program 's actions in removing biosoluble glass wool fibers from the report on carcinogens , '' september 9 , 2011 . the national academy of sciences nrc subcommittee on manufactured vitreous fibers . 2000 . review of the u.s . navy 's exposure standard for manufactured vitreous fibers . national academy of sciences , national research council , washington , d.c . : national academy press . and harvard 's medical and public health schools which reached the same conclusion as iarc that there is no evidence of increased risk from occupational exposure to glass wool fibers . fiberglass will irritate the eyes , skin , and the respiratory system . potential symptoms include irritation of eyes , skin , nose , throat , dyspnea ( breathing difficulty ) ; sore throat , hoarseness and cough . scientific evidence demonstrates that fiberglass is safe to manufacture , install and use when recommended work practices are followed to reduce temporary mechanical irritation . unfortunately these work practices are not always followed , and fiberglass is often left exposed in basements that later become occupied . fiberglass insulation should never be left exposed in an occupied area , according to the american lung association . while the resins are cured , styrene vapors are released . these are irritating to mucous membranes and respiratory tract . therefore , the hazardous substances ordinance in germany dictates a maximum occupational exposure limit of 86 & nbsp ; mg/m 3 . in certain concentrations , a potentially explosive mixture may occur . further manufacture of grp components ( grinding , cutting , sawing ) creates fine dust and chips containing glass filaments , as well as tacky dust , in quantities high enough to affect health and the functionality of machines and equipment . the installation of effective extraction and filtration equipment is required to ensure safety and efficiency . türschmann , v . ; jakschik , c . ; rother , h.-j .
