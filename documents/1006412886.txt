Inner London Education Authority

history . the inner london education authority was established when the greater london council ( glc ) replaced the london county council as the principal local authority for london in 1965 . the lcc had taken over responsibility for education in inner london from the london school board in 1904 . in what was to become outer london , education was primarily administered by the relevant county councils and county boroughs , with some functions delegated to second-tier councils in the area . the herbert commission report in 1960 recommended the establishment of the greater london council . it advocated a london-wide division of educational powers between the glc and the london boroughs . the glc would be responsible for strategic control of schools , and the boroughs for routine management . this part of the report was rejected by the government . councils in the future outer london area wanted greater control over education , preventing the creation of a london-wide lea , and there was strong opposition from teachers and other bodies to the idea of dividing up the lcc lea . the london government act 1963 therefore created the ilea to inherit the educational responsibilities of the lcc , and gave outer london boroughs lea status . the ilea was originally conceived as a provisional body whose status would be reviewed before 1970 , but the labour government made its status permanent in 1965 . the ilea did not cover the small area of north woolwich , which was part of the county of london but was transferred to the new london borough of newham in outer london . the ilea had a somewhat anomalous legal status . technically the glc itself was the education authority for inner london , but it was both administratively difficult and politically unjust to allow outer london members of the glc to have an input . therefore , the glc delegated responsibility to the ilea as a 'special committee ' , consisting of the members of the glc from the inner london area , plus one member delegated from each of the inner london boroughs and the city of london . members of the glc/ilea tended to concentrate on one duty only , although they attended the meetings of both . political composition . it was possible for the ilea to have a majority of labour members when the glc had a majority of conservative members , and this happened from 1970 to 1973 and 1977 to 1981 . in addition , most of the important decisions taken by the ilea were taken by its education committee , on which every member sat . the education committee could also co-opt members with experience of education , some of them representing the teaching unions . the initial composition of the ilea in 1964 was 43 labour members to 9 conservatives , with one independent . after the 1967 election the conservatives won a majority , and christopher chataway became leader . however , labour won control in 1970 and ashley bramall began his long leadership . his term saw the ilea go over to comprehensive education , and the abolition of school corporal punishment . he retained power despite the conservative election victory in the 1977 glc elections . when the left , under ken livingstone , won control of the glc after the 1981 elections , bramall lost his position in an internal labour party vote , being replaced by bryn davies . livingstone later expressed regret for this decision and expressed his admiration for bramall 's leadership abilities . the remaining years of the ilea saw a succession of left-wing leaderships , none of which lasted long or established a strong reputation . frances morrell , formerly an assistant to tony benn , led a feminist ilea from 1983 to 1987 which threatened to defy its rate-capping in november 1984 , before neil fletcher took over . list of leaders . the ilea was formally created in 1964 and began operations in 1965 , but the post of leader did not exist until april 1967 . for the period 1964–67 the de facto leadership was shared between the chairman of the education committee , james young , and the chairmen of the authority , harold shearman ( 1964–1965 ) and ashley bramall ( 1965–1967 ) . from 1967 the leaders of the ilea were : christopher chataway 1967–1969 lena townsend 1969–1970 ashley bramall 1970–1981 bryn davies 1981–1983 frances morrell 1983–1987 neil fletcher 1987–1990 les ( ashrath ) francis 1989-1990 . additional functions . the ilea had its own schools broadcasting service , the educational television service , based in the former tennyson secondary school , thackeray road , sw8 . the television centre had two functional television studios , a training studio , a master control and sound and vision mixing suites . london 's independent tv studios at one stage this was believed to be the largest closed circuit television system in the world . the first transmission took place on 16 september 1969 and the television service ran until 1977 . london metropolitan archives -
