sumerian and babylonian . the standard ancient sumerian king list ( wb 444 ) lists various mythical antediluvian kings and gives them reigns of several tens of thousands of years . the first sumerian king alulim , at eridu , is described as reigning for 28,800 years , followed by several later kings of similar periods . in total these antediluvian kings ruled for 241,200 years from the time when '' the kingship was lowered from heaven '' to the time when '' the flood '' swept over the land . the sumerian king list , thorkild jacobsen , 1939 , pp . 71 , 77 ) . excavations in iraq have revealed evidence of localized flooding at shuruppak ( modern tell fara , iraq ) and various other sumerian cities—all dated to the same time . a layer of riverine sediments , radiocarbon dated to ca . 2900 bc , interrupts the continuity of settlement , extending as far north as the city of kish . polychrome pottery from the jemdet nasr period ( 3000–2900 bc ) was discovered immediately below the shuruppak flood stratum . the '' flood '' described in the sumerian king list , is believed to have a historical basis , and has been dated 2900 bc . sumer and the sumerians , harriet crawford , cambridge university press , 2004 . adding 241,200 years to 2900 gives the date 244,100 bc ; however , most modern scholars do not believe the ancient sumerians or babylonians believed in a chronology of their own this old . instead they believed that these figures were either fabrications , or were based on not literal solar years ( 365.2425 days ) but instead lunar months ( 29.53059 days ) .

'' scholars such as wilkinson ( 1851 ) , bunsen ( 1845 ) and meyer ( 1904 ) all came to the same conclusion independently . this finding was later popularized by several non-scholarly books .

, various dates have been proposed for the date of creation since ancient times , to more recent periods . the bible begins with the book of genesis , in which god creates the earth , the rest of the universe , and the earth 's plants and animals , including the first humans , in six days . a second narrative begins with the first human pair , adam and eve , and goes on to list many of their descendants , in many cases giving the ages at which they had children and died . if these events and ages are interpreted literally throughout and the genealogies are considered closed , it is possible to build up a chronology in which many of the events of the old testament are dated to an estimated number of years after creation . some biblical scholars have gone further , attempting to harmonise this biblical chronology with that of recorded history , thus establishing a date for creation in a modern calendar . since the biblical story lacks chronology for some periods , the duration of events has been subject to interpretation in many different ways , resulting in a variety of estimates of the date of creation . numerous efforts have been made to determine the biblical date of creation , yielding varying results . besides differences in interpretation , the use of different versions of the bible can also affect the result . two dominant dates for creation using such models exist , about 5500 bc and about 4000 bc . these were calculated from the genealogies in two versions of the bible , with most of the difference arising from two versions of genesis . the older dates stem from the greek septuagint . septuagint , genesis the later dates are based on the hebrew masoretic text . the patriarchs from adam to terah , the father of abraham , were often 100 years older when they begat their named son in the septuagint than they were in the hebrew or the vulgate ( genesis 5 , 11 ) . the net difference between the two genealogies of genesis amounts to 1466 years ( ignoring the '' second year after the flood '' ambiguity ) , which accounts for virtually all of the 1500-year difference between 5500 bc and 4000 bc . for example , the period from the creation to the flood derives from the genealogical table of the ten patriarchs listed in , and , called the generations of adam . according to the masoretic text , this period consists of 1,656 years , and western christian bibles deriving from the latin vulgate also follow this dating . however , the samaritan texts give an equivalent period of 1,307 years , and according to the septuagint ( codex alexandrinus , elizabeth bible ) it is 2,262 years . catholic encyclopedia : biblical chronology james ussher agrees with the dating until the birth of abraham , which he argues took place when terah was 130 , and not 70 as is the direct reading of , thus adding 60 years to his chronology for events postdating abraham . . early jewish estimations . the earliest post-exilic jewish chronicle preserved in the hebrew language , the seder olam rabbah , compiled by jose ben halafta in 160 ad , dates the creation of the world to 3761 bc while the later seder olam zutta to 4339 bc . young ’ s

version of the bible calculated creation as having occurred about 5500 bc , and christians up to the middle-ages continued to use this rough estimate : clement of alexandria ( 5592 bc ) , theophilus of antioch ( 5529 bc ) , sextus julius africanus ( 5501 bc ) , hippolytus of rome ( 5500 bc ) , gregory of tours ( 5500 bc ) , panodorus of alexandria ( 5493 bc ) , maximus the confessor ( 5493 bc ) ,

's specific chronology dating the creation to 4004 bc became the most accepted and popular , mainly because this specific date was attached to the king james bible . . alfonsine tables . alfonso x of
