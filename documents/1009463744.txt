Oresteia

agamemnon . agamemnon , agamémnōn ) is the first of the three plays within the oresteia trilogy . it details the homecoming of agamemnon , king of mycenae , from the trojan war . after ten years of warfare , troy had fallen and all of greece could lay claim to victory . waiting at home for agamemnon is his wife , queen clytemnestra , who has been planning his murder . she desires his death to avenge the sacrifice of her daughter iphigenia , to exterminate the only thing hindering her from commandeering the crown , and to finally be able to publicly embrace her long-time lover aegisthus . the play opens to a watchman looking down and over the sea , reporting that he has been lying restless '' like a dog '' for a year , waiting to see some sort of signal confirming a greek victory in troy . he laments the fortunes of the house , but promises to keep silent : '' a huge ox has stepped onto my tongue . '' the watchman sees a light far off in the distance—a bonfire signaling troy 's fall—and is overjoyed at the victory and hopes for the hasty return of his king , as the house has '' wallowed '' in his absence . clytemnestra is introduced to the audience and she declares that there will be celebrations and sacrifices throughout the city as agamemnon and his army return . upon the return of agamemnon , his wife laments in full view of argos how horrible the wait for her husband , and king , has been . after her soliloquy , clytemnestra pleads with and convinces agamemnon to walk on the robes laid out for him . this is a very ominous moment in the play as loyalties and motives are questioned . the king 's new concubine , cassandra , is now introduced and this immediately spawns hatred from the queen , clytemnestra . cassandra is ordered out of her chariot and to the altar where , once she is alone , is heard crying out insane prophecies to apollo about the death of agamemnon and her own shared fate . inside the house a cry is heard ; agamemnon has been stabbed in the bathtub . the chorus separate from one another and ramble to themselves , proving their cowardice , when another final cry is heard . when the doors are finally opened , clytemnestra is seen standing over the dead bodies of agamemnon and cassandra . clytemnestra describes the murder in detail to the chorus , showing no sign of remorse or regret . suddenly the exiled lover of clytemnestra , aegisthus , bursts into the palace to take his place next to her . aegisthus proudly states that he devised the plan to murder agamemnon and claim revenge for his father ( the father of aegisthus , thyestes , was tricked into eating two of his sons by his brother atreus , the father of agamemnon ) . clytemnestra claims that she and aegisthus now have all the power and they re-enter the palace with the doors closing behind them . . the libation bearers . in 1999 , katie mitchell followed him at the same venue ( though in the cottesloe theatre , where hall had directed in the olivier theatre ) with a production which used ted hughes ' translation . in 2015 , robert icke 's production of his own adaptation was a sold out hit at the almeida theatre and was transferred that same year to the west end 's trafalgar studios . two other productions happened in the uk that year , in manchester and at shakespeare 's globe . the following year , in 2016 , playwright zinnie harris premiered her adaptation , this restless house , at the citizen 's theatre to five-star critical acclaim . other adaptations 1895 : composer sergei taneyev adapted the trilogy into his own oresteia ( opera ) of the same name , which was premiered in 1895 . 1965-66 : composer iannis xenakis adapted vocal work for chorus and 12 instruments . 1967 : composer felix werder adapted agamemnon as an opera . thérèse radic .
