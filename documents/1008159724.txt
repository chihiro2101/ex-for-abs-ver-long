Phaistos Disc

discovery . thumbthe phaistos disc was discovered in the minoan palace-site of phaistos , near hagia triada , on the south coast of crete ; c.michael hogan , phaistos fieldnotes , the modern antiquarian , 2007 specifically the disc was found in the basement of room 8 in building 101 of a group of buildings to the northeast of the main palace . this grouping of four rooms also served as a formal entry into the palace complex . italy archaeologist luigi pernier recovered the intact '' dish '' , about in diameter and uniformly slightly more than in thickness , on 3 july 1908 during his excavation of the first minoan palace . it was found in the main cell of an underground '' temple depository '' . these basement cells , only accessible from above , were neatly covered with a layer of fine plaster . their content was poor in precious artifacts , but rich in black earth and ashes , mixed with burnt bovine bones . in the northern part of the main cell , in the same black layer , a few centimetres south-east of the disc and about above the floor , linear a tablet ph 1 was also found . the site apparently collapsed as a result of an earthquake , possibly linked with the eruption of the santorini volcano that affected large parts of the mediterranean region during the mid second millennium b.c . authenticity . the phaistos disc is generally accepted as authentic by archaeologists . the assumption of authenticity is based on the excavation records by luigi pernier . this assumption is supported by the later discovery of the arkalochori axe with similar but not identical glyphs . the possibility that the disc is a 1908 forgery or hoax has been raised by two scholars . robinson:2008 according to a report in the times the date of manufacture has never been established by thermoluminescence . dalya alberge , '' phaistos disc declared as fake by scholar '' , the times , 12 july 2008 in his 2008 review , robinson does not endorse the forgery arguments , but argues that '' a thermoluminescence test for the phaistos disc is imperative . it will either confirm that new finds are worth hunting for , or it will stop scholars from wasting their effort . '' a gold signet ring from knossos ( the mavro spilio ring ) , found in 1926 , contains a linear a inscription developed in a field defined by a spiral‚Äîsimilar to the phaistos disc . siegel cms ii,3 038 a sealing found in 1955 shows the only known parallel to sign 21 ( êá§ , the '' comb '' ) of the phaistos disc . notes on the autheticity of the phaistos disc this is considered as evidence that the phaistos disc is a genuine minoan artifact . seal of the month - 2013 heidelberg university . dating . yves duhoux ( 1977 ) dates the disc to between 1850 b.c . and 1600 b.c . ( mmiii ) on the basis of luigi pernier 's report , which says that the disc was in a middle minoan undisturbed context . jeppesen ( 1963 ) dates it to after 1400 ( lmii-iii ) . doubting the viability of pernier 's report , louis godart ( 1990 ) resigns himself to admitting that archaeologically , the disc may be dated to anywhere in middle or late minoan times ( mmi-lmiii , a period spanning most of the second millennium b.c . ) . j . best suggests a date in the first half of the fourteenth century b.c . ( lmiiia ) based on his dating of tablet ph 1 . . typography . the inscription was apparently made by pressing hieroglyphic '' seals '' into the soft clay , in a clockwise sequence spiraling toward the center of the disk . it was then fired at high temperature . the unique character of the phaistos disc stems from the fact that the entire text was inscribed in this way , reproducing a body of text with reusable characters . the german typesetter and linguist herbert brekle , in his article '' the typographic principle '' in the gutenberg-jahrbuch , argues that the phaistos disc is an early document of movable type printing , since it meets the essential criterion of typographic printing , that of type identity : as a medieval example for the same technique he goes on to cite the pr√ºfening dedicatory inscription . herbert e . brekle ( 1997 ) : '' das typographische prinzip . versuch einer begriffskl√§rung '' , gutenberg-jahrbuch , vol . 72 , pp . 58‚Äì63 ( 62f . ) herbert e . brekle ( 2005 ) : die pr√ºfeninger weiheinschrift von 1119 . eine pal√§ographisch-typographische untersuchung ( brief summary ) , scriptorium verlag f√ºr kultur und wissenschaft , regensburg , in his work on decipherment , benjamin schwartz also refers to the phaistos disc as '' the first movable type '' . in his popular science book guns , germs and steel , jared diamond describes the disc as an example of a technological advancement that did not become widespread because it was made at the wrong time in history , and contrasts this with gutenberg 's printing press . . inscription . unicode . a set of 46 phaistos disc characters , comprising 45 signs and one combining oblique stroke , have been encoded in unicode since april 2008 ( unicode version 5.1 ) . they are assigned to the range 101d0‚Äì101ff in plane 1 ( the supplementary multilingual plane ) . phaistos disc characters were encoded with strong left-to-right directionality , and so in code charts and text ( such as elsewhere on this page ) the glyphs are mirrored from the way they appear on the disc itself . modern use . side a of the phaistos disc is used as the logo of forth , one of the largest research centers in greece . see also . arkalochori axe dispilio tablet youra potsherds cretan hieroglyphs linear a . references . further reading . general . balistier , thomas . the phaistos disc - an account of its unsolved mystery , verlag thomas balistier , 2000 . bennett , emmett l .
