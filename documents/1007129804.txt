Kijūrō Shidehara

early life and career . shidehara was born in kadoma , osaka . his brother taira was the first president of national taiwan university . shidehara attended university of tokyo , and graduated from the faculty of law , where he had studied under hozumi nobushige . after graduation , he found a position within the foreign ministry and was sent as a consul to chemulpo in korea in 1896 . he subsequently served in the japanese embassy in london , antwerp , and washington d.c . and as ambassador to the netherlands , returning to japan in 1915 . in 1915 , shidehara was appointed vice minister of foreign affairs and continued in this position during five consecutive administrations . in 1919 , he was named ambassador to the united states and was japan 's leading negotiator during the washington naval conference . his negotiations led to the return of jiaozhou bay concession to china . however , while he was ambassador , the united states enacted discriminatory immigration laws against japanese , which created much ill will in japan . shidehara was elevated to the title of danshaku ( baron ) under the kazoku peerage system in 1920 , and appointed to a seat in the house of peers in 1925 . file : japanese_delegation_arrived_october_24th % 2c_1921.jpg from left to right : robert woods bliss , robert coontz , kanji kato , kunishige tanaka , andre brewster at the washington conference on october 24 , 1921 . file : kijūrō_shidehara , _tomosaburō_katō_and_iesato_tokugawa.jpg left to right ; baron kijuro shidehara , admiral katō tomosaburō , prince iesato tokugawa on november 3 , 1921 , to attend the washington naval conference . . first term as foreign minister . in 1924 , shidehara became minister of foreign affairs in the cabinet of prime minister katō takaaki and continued in this post under prime ministers wakatsuki reijirō and osachi hamaguchi . despite growing japanese militarism , shidehara attempted to maintain a non-interventionist policy toward china , and good relations with great britain and the united states , which he admired . in his initial speech to the diet of japan , he pledged to uphold the principles of the league of nations . the term '' shidehara diplomacy '' came to describe japan 's liberal foreign policy during the 1920s . in october 1925 , he surprised other delegates to the beijing customs conference in pushing for agreement to china 's demands for tariff autonomy . in march 1927 , during the nanking incident , he refused to agree to an ultimatum prepared by other foreign powers threatening retaliation for the actions of chiang kai-shek 's kuomintang troops for their attacks on foreign consulates and settlements . disgruntlement by the military over shidehara 's china policies was one of the factors that led to the collapse of the administration of prime minister wakatsuki in april 1927 . during his diplomatic career , shidehara was known for his excellent command of the english language . at one press conference , an american reporter was confused regarding the pronunciation of shidehara 's name : the foreign minister replied , '' i 'm hi ( he ) -dehara , and my wife is shi ( she ) -dehara . '' because his wife was a quaker , shidehara was rumoured to be one too . second term as foreign minister . shidehara returned as foreign minister in 1929 , and immediately resumed the non-interventionist policy in china , attempting to restore good relations with chiang kai-shek 's government now based in nanjing . this policy was assailed by military interests who believed it was weakening the country , especially after the conclusion of the london naval conference 1930 , which precipitated a major political crisis . when prime minister osachi hamaguchi was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt , shidehara served as interim prime minister until march 1931 . in september 1931 , the kwangtung army invaded and occupied manchuria in the manchurian incident without prior authorization from the central government . this effectively ended the non-interventionist policy towards china , and shidehara ’ s career as foreign minister . in october 1931 , shidehara was featured on the cover of time with the caption '' japan 's man of peace and war '' . shidehara remained in government as a member of the house of peers from 1931 to 1945 . he maintained a low profile through the end of world war ii . prime minister . at the time of japan 's surrender in 1945 , shidehara was in semi-retirement . however , largely because of his pro-american reputation , he was appointed to serve as japan ’ s first post-war prime minister , from 9 october 1945 to 22 may 1946 . along with the post of prime minister , shidehara became president of the progressive party ( shinpo-tō ) . shidehara 's cabinet appointed a non-official committee to look into the question of drafting a new constitution for japan in line with general douglas macarthur 's policy directives , but the draft was vetoed by the occupation authorities . according to macarthur and others , it was shidehara who originally proposed the inclusion of article 9 of the constitution of japan , a provision which limits japan 's ability to wage war . shidehara , in his memoirs gaikō gojūnen ( '' fifty-years diplomacy '' , 1951 ) also admitted to his authorship , and described how the idea came to him on a train ride to tokyo . already when he was ambassador in washington , he had become acquainted with the idea of 'outlawing war ' in international and constitutional law . one of his famous sayings was : “ let us create a world without war ( sensō naki sekai ) together with the world-humanity ( sekai jinrui ) . ” however , his supposed conservative economic policies and family ties to the mitsubishi interests made him unpopular with the leftist movement . the shidehara cabinet resigned following japan 's first postwar election , when the liberal party of japan captured most of the votes . shigeru yoshida became prime minister in shidehara 's wake . shidehara joined the liberal party a year later , after prime minister tetsu katayama formed a socialism . as one of katayama 's harshest critics , shidehara was elected speaker of the house of representatives . he died in this post in 1951 . personal life . in 1903 he married masako iwasaki , who came from the family that founded the mitsubishi zaibatsu or group of companies . klaus schlichtmann , a statesman for the twenty-first century ?
