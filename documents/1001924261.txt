The Electric Prunes

history . origin . the band originated from a surf rock-influenced garage rock group , the sanctions , in 1965 . the sanctions , which included james lowe ( vocals , guitar ) , mark tulin ( bass guitar ) , ken williams ( lead guitar ) , and michael '' quint '' weakley ( drums ) , recorded 12 cover songs on an acetate disc on march 27 , 1965 , in a home studio owned by russ bottomley . for their next set of recordings on september 29 , 1965 , the group , then known as jim and the lords , was joined by keyboardist dick hargrave , who left shortly afterwards to pursue a career in graphic arts . the songs went unreleased until heartbeat productions distributed the 2000 album , then came the electric prunes , which was commended for its good sound quality , considering the circumstances in which it was recorded . back to a quartet , the band , while rehearsing in a garage , met a real estate agent named barbara harris . harris had connections in the music industry , and introduced the group to dave hassinger to record demos at sky hill studios . hassinger , who had been working as the resident sound engineer at rca studios and recently completed development for the rolling stones ' album , aftermath , expressed a desire to produce a record . he suggested to the group that they change their name , and they considered a list of alternatives . according to lowe , the name electric prunes started off as a joke , but he eventually convinced other band members , saying , '' it 's the one thing everyone will remember . it 's not attractive , and there 's nothing sexy about it , but people wo n't forget it . '' as a result of the recordings , a single , featuring a cover of the gypsy trips ' folk rock tune , '' ai n't it hard '' , and the lowe-penned song , '' little olive '' , was released in early 1966 , but failed to chart . . early success . despite the commercial failure of '' ai n't it hard '' , reprise records was encouraged by the group 's effort , and signed the band to a recording contract that left them under hassinger 's authority . weakley departed the band after the single , and was replaced by preston ritter , and rhythm guitarist james '' weasel '' spagnola was recruited to make the electric prunes a quintet . although the band was composing their own material , hassinger called upon songwriters annette tucker and nancie mantz to write the majority of the group 's songs . the new line-up recorded six demos at american recording studio and leon russell 's studio . these mainly comprised cover songs and tucker-mantz compositions . according to lowe , while at russell 's recording studio , '' dave cued up a tape and did n't hit 'record , ' and the playback in the studio was way up : ear-shattering vibrating jet guitar . ken had been shaking his bigsby wiggle stick with some fuzztone and tremolo at the end of the tape . forward it was cool . backward it was amazing . i ran into the control room and said , 'what was that ? ' they did n't have the monitors on so they had n't heard it . i made dave cut if off and save it for later . '' the fluttering buzz sound was utilized for the opening to the tucker-mantz song , '' i had too much to dream ( last night ) '' , which also included a heavily-textured psychedelic guitar motif . the song was chosen to be released as the electric prunes ' second single in november 1966 . it peaked at number 11 on the billboard hot 100 and reached number 49 on the uk singles chart . the success of the single prompted immediate touring , and earned the group a promotional contract with musical equipment makers vox . williams recorded an advert , demonstrating the use of vox 's wah-wah pedal in early 1967 , and the band was featured in magazines such as vox teen beat . the band 's follow-up single , '' get me to the world on time '' , which put distorted sound effects to a psychedelic-tinged bo diddley beat , was released in may 1967 . the song managed to chart at number 27 in the us and number 42 in the uk , and was the most electronically experimental composition by the group thus far . when it came time for the electric prunes to record songs for their first album , they were limited musically due to the predominate presence of tucker and mantz 's ( also jill jones ) songwriting partnership , which composed the majority of the album 's material . the group 's debut album , the electric prunes possessed exotically-combined effects , and violin-like guitar riffs , mixed with a diverse , and somewhat uneven , selection of pop songs , with only '' train for tomorrow '' and '' luvin ' '' being penned by the band . tracks such as the soft rock tune , '' onie '' and '' toonerville trolley '' suggest inconsistency in an attempt to produce a commercially viable sound . reflecting on the album , tulin said , '' consequently there are definitely songs that i believe do not belong on the album and were , in fact , a waste of our time and energy . there were several other ideas we were working on , but we realized there was no use pursuing them because they too would have been 'too weird . ' '' in july 1967 , the band released their fourth single , one of the more unusual compositions to come from the pen of the tucker-mantz songwriting duo , '' dr . do-good '' . the song , which featured williams playing a prototype steel guitar , and childlike to maddening vocals , was described by music historian richie unterberger as '' sounding more like a horror movie theme run amok than a radio-ready hit '' , and consequently the single bubbled under the hot 100 at number 128 . the electric prunes reconvened at american recording studios to record their second album , underground , though hassinger was not as involved in the band 's activities , which allowed much more creative freedom to the group to write their own material . for the album , the band wrote seven of the twelve tracks , and expanded upon the experimentation of the first album , with inventive guitar reverb and oscillation , in a unified effort . however , in the middle of the recording sessions the line-up went through changes when ritter departed for musical differences , and was replaced by original drummer weakley , who appeared on five tracks . spagnola left near the conclusion of recording to address medical concerns , and mike gannon was recruited to finish the album . gannon was included on just two songs as well as the non-album track , '' everybody knows you 're not in love '' . in august 1967 , underground was released , but , without a hit-ready single , did not fare as well on the billboard 200 , where it peaked at number 172 . after a u.s . tour in the latter half of 1967 , the new line-up embarked on a european tour and this led to appearances at high-profile venues such as the roundhouse , the speakeasy club and middle earth . on the final leg of the tour , the electric prunes ' performance was recorded in stockholm by the sveriges radio . the recordings were issued in 1997 on the live album , stockholm '67 . . the axelrod period . at the suggestion of manager lenny poncher and hassinger , the electric prunes agreed to record a concept album that integrated gregorian music into psychedelic pop , with the belief it would launch them into commercial success . poncher recruited david axelrod , a formally neo-classically trained musician , to compose all of the material for the project . the result , mass in f minor , was a complex arrangement of religious-based rock , which was sung entirely in greek and latin . although the band did record the songs '' kyrie eleison '' , '' gloria '' , and '' credo '' , the intricate orchestration proved to be too difficult and time-consuming for the group . as a consequence , hassinger enlisted the canadian group the collectors , among other session musicians , in completing the album , although lowe , tulin , and weakley did contribute to every track . mass in f minor was released in january 1968 and reached number 135 on the billboard 200 . an eerie version of the opening track , '' kyrie eleison '' , became somewhat of an underground favorite when it appeared in the soundtrack for the counterculture film , easy rider . the electric prunes performed with the new songs in concert just once , at the santa monica civic auditorium , which tulin described : '' from the outset the performance was a disaster . we missed the intro on the first song and it never got any better . amp speakers blew , charts fell off music stands and everyone was , in general , in a complete state of confusion . ended up each song turned into one long jam . i think we were , at times , all in the same key . i made my way over to the four celli and four french horns and told them to 'jam in e . ' somehow we would hit a break and james would manage a vocal '' . as a result of financial and musical issues , weakley and lowe left the group in early 1968 . tulin and williams finished a tour with a line-up that also included kenny loggins and jeremy stuart , but by mid-1968 they too departed the group . nonetheless , hassinger still owned the rights to the electric prunes 's name , and was encouraged by the success of mass in f minor , which prompted him to assemble a new line-up . he was steered toward the colorado group , climax , by rich fifield . fifield had worked in fellow colorado band , hardwater ( previously the surf rock band the astronauts ) , which was managed by poncher , and produced an album with axelrod . the new electric prunes line-up included climax members richard whetstone ( vocals , guitar ) , john herron ( organ ) , and mark kincaid ( guitar ) with brett wade ( bass guitar ) , who was recommended by the collectors . with the group restructured , axelrod , again , composed all the material for their next album , in the same vein as the previous effort , and centered it around the jewish prayer , kol nidre . the album , titled release of an oath , utilized several session musicians including howard roberts , carol kaye , and earl palmer , and saw whetstone as the only band member to contribute to the recordings . although the album was considered more cohesive and progressive than its predecessor , it failed to chart upon its release in november 1968 . afterwards , axelrod returned to his past position at capitol records , and the electric prunes toured as a supporting act for bands such as steppenwolf , canned heat , and buffalo springfield . . the '' new improved '' electric prunes . the band 's final album , just good old rock and roll , was released in june 1969 with the cover describing the group as the '' new improved '' electric prunes . herron left the group before they completed recording of the album , though he was still credited as the keyboardist . he was replaced by ron morgan , who had been the guitarist of three dog night , and an essential session musician for the first three albums released by the west coast pop art experimental band . with the exception of '' finders keepers , losers weepers '' , which was co-written by jimmy holiday , all the songs on just good old rock and roll were composed solely by the band . in addition , wade composed '' flowing smoothly '' , the b-side to the non-album single , '' hey , mr . president '' . just good old rock and roll is much more straightforward than past works , consisting of funk-influenced hard rock , although '' so many people to tell '' and '' silver passion mine '' also exhibit a late-psychedelic sound . as whetstone explains , '' we were fairly naive in terms of guidance ; we had none , so we were experimenting with a lot of musical styles . if you listen to the album , you 'll hear a lot of diversity , feel and tempo changes.that was our learning curve . '' in early 1970 , whetstone and wade departed the band and moved to canada where they formed stallion thumbrock . morgan and kincaid constructed another line-up of the electric prunes that included michael kearns , clay groomer , huey plumeigh , and galen pugh ; however , by mid-1970 the band dissolved . . revival and reformation . although the band broke up in 1970 , their material continued to be circulated through reissues and compilation albums . following the inclusion of '' i had too much to dream ( last night ) '' as the first track on the seminal nuggets : original artyfacts from the first psychedelic era , 1965–1968 in 1972 , a slow return of interest in the band 's music began . in europe , the band 's albums were re-released , with 1986 seeing the reissue of underground , release of an oath , and , essentially the electric prunes 's first greatest hits album , long days flight . this was the first album to include their first single , '' ai n't it hard '' , the non-lp track '' you never had it better '' , and the first to be released on the compact disc format in 1989 . by 1997 , all of the group 's albums were available via compact disc . following the release of the 1997 live album , stockholm '67 , on heartbeat records , the original line-up of tulin , lowe , williams , and weakley ( now known as fortune ) reconvened , in 1999 , to record new material for the first time in 31 years . after the success of the 2001 compilation album , lost dreams , the band began to perform live again along with new members . on october 31 , 2001 , the band released the album , artifact , which included several guest musicians , most notably former moby grape guitarist , peter lewis . deemed the '' one we never got to make '' , the album was a cohesive take on the band 's psychedelic sound . in august 2002 , the group toured europe for the first time since 1968 , with concerts in the uk and greece and , in 2003 , a dvd looking into the uk portion of their european tour , called rewired , was released . additional albums were released over the years , including the concept album , california , in 2004 , and their most experimental album since the electric prunes 's reformation , feedback , in 2006 . on february 26 , 2011 , tulin died aged 62 from a heart attack while volunteering at the university of southern california catalina hyperbaric chamber . after tulin 's death , the band went on hiatus , but returned to touring in 2013 . on may 22 , 2014 , the band released was , which featured new material inspired by the group 's tour in tokyo , japan . the album includes the last recordings with tulin , and the two live tracks , '' smokestack lightning '' and '' bullet thru the backseat '' . preston ritter died in 2015 , aged 65 . . band members . current members . james lowe – lead vocals , harmonica , percussion , theremin , guitar , autoharp ( 1965–1968 , 1999–present ) steve kara – lead guitar , backing vocals ( 2003–present ) jay dean – rhythm guitar , backing vocals ( 2004–present ) walter garces – drums ( 2006–present ) rocco guarino– bass , backing vocals ( 2013–present ) . former members . mark tulin ( 1965–1968 , 1999–2011 ; died 2011 ) - bass , keyboards ken williams ( 1965–1968 , 1999–2003 , 2006 ) - lead guitar michael '' quint '' weakley ( 1965–1966 , 1967 , 2001 ) - drums , percussion steve acoff ( 1965 ) dick hargraves ( 1965 ) - keyboards preston ritter ( 1966–1967 ; died 2015 ) - drums , percussion james '' weasel '' spagnola ( 1966–1967 ; died c.2000 ) - rhythm guitar , backing and lead vocals joe dooley ( 1967–1968 , 2001–2005 ) - drums mike gannon ( 1967–1968 ) - rhythm guitar john herron ( 1968–1970 ; died 2003 ) - keyboards mark kincaid ( 1968–1970 ; died c.1994 ) - guitar , backing vocals brett wade ( 1968–1970 ) - bass , backing vocals , flute dick whetstone ( 1968–1970 ) - drums , lead vocals , guitar kenny loggins ( 1968 ) jeromy stuart ( 1968 ) ron morgan ( 1969–1970 ; died 1989 ) - guitar cameron lowe ( 2001–2003 ) - keyboards mark moulin ( 2001–2003 ) - lead guitar glen bostic ( 2007 ) . discography . studio albums . the electric prunes ( 1967 ) underground ( 1967 ) mass in f minor ( composed by david axelrod ) ( 1968 ) release of an oath ( 1968 ) just good old rock and roll ( 1969 ) artifact ( 2001 ) california ( 2004 ) feedback ( 2006 ) was ( 2014 ) . live albums . stockholm '67 ( heartbeat bmro39 ) , 1997 return to stockholm live at debaser 2004 ( prunetwang 8-69691-13 ) , 2012 . u.s . singles .
