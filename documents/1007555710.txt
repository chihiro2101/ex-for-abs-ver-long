John Stark

early life . john stark was born in londonderry , new hampshire ( at a site that is now in derry ) in 1728 . his father , archibald stark ( 1693-1758 ) was born in glasgow , scotland , to parents who were from wiltshire , england ; landmarks of the american revolution : a guide to locating and knowing what happened at the sites of independence by mark mayo boatner - hawthorn books , 1975 page 158-159 stark 's father met his future wife when he moved to derry in ireland . ferling p . 36 when stark was eight years old , his family moved to derryfield ( now manchester , new hampshire ) , where he lived for the rest of his life . stark married molly stark , with whom he had 11 children including his eldest son caleb stark . on april 28 , 1752 , while on a hunting and trapping trip along the baker river , a tributary of the pemigewasset river , he was captured by abenaki warriors and brought back to canada but not before warning his brother william to paddle away in his canoe , though david stinson was killed . while a prisoner of the abenaki , he and his fellow prisoner amos eastman were made to run a gauntlet of warriors armed with sticks . stark grabbed the stick from the first warrior 's hands and proceeded to attack him , taking the rest of the warriors by surprise . the chief was so impressed by this heroic act that stark was adopted into the tribe , where he spent the winter . caleb stark , john stark , memoir and official correspondence of gen . john stark : with notices of several other officers of the revolution . also , a biography of capt . phinehas stevens and of col . robert rogers , with an account of his services in america during the '' seven years ' war . '' g.p . lyon , 1860 the following spring a government agent sent from the province of massachusetts bay to work on the exchange of prisoners paid his ransom of 103 spanish dollars and 60 for amos eastman . stark and eastman then returned to new hampshire safely . french and indian war . stark served as a second lieutenant under major robert rogers during the french and indian war . his brother william stark served beside him . as a member of the daring rogers ' rangers , stark gained valuable combat experience and a detailed knowledge of the northern frontier of the american colonies . while serving with the rangers in 1757 , stark went on a scouting mission toward fort carillon in which the rangers were ambushed . general jeffery amherst , in 1759 ordered rogers ' rangers to journey from lake george to the abenaki village of st . francis , deep in quebec . the rangers went north and attacked the indian town . stark , rogers ' second-in-command of all ranger companies , refused to accompany the attacking force out of respect for his indian foster-parents residing there . he returned to new hampshire to his wife , whom he had married the previous year . at the end of the war , stark retired as a captain and returned to derryfield , new hampshire . american revolution . bunker hill . the battles of lexington and concord on april 19 , 1775 , signaled the start of the american revolutionary war , and stark returned to military service . on april 23 , 1775 , stark accepted a colonelcy in the new hampshire militia and was given command of the 1st new hampshire regiment and james reed of the 3rd new hampshire regiment , also outside of boston . as soon as stark could muster his men , he ferried and marched them south to boston to support the blockaded rebels there . he made his headquarters in the confiscated isaac royall house in medford , massachusetts . on june 16 , the rebels , fearing a preemptive british attack on their positions in cambridge and roxbury , decided to take and hold breed 's hill , a high point on the charlestown peninsula near boston . on the night of the 16th , american troops moved into position on the heights and began digging entrenchments . as dawn approached , lookouts on hms lively , a 20-gun sloop of war noticed the activity and the sloop opened fire on the rebels and the works in progress . this in turn drew the attention of the british admiral , who demanded to know what the lively was shooting at . subsequent to that , the entire british squadron opened fire . as dawn broke on june 17 the british could clearly see hastily constructed fortifications on breed 's hill , and british gen . thomas gage knew that he would have to drive the rebels out before fortifications were complete . he ordered major general william howe to prepare to land his troops . thus began the battle of bunker hill . american col . william prescott held the hill throughout the intense initial bombardment with only a few hundred american militia . prescott knew that he was sorely outgunned and outnumbered . he sent a desperate request for reinforcements . stark and reed with the new hampshire minutemen arrived at the scene soon after prescott 's request . the lively had begun a rain of accurate artillery fire directed at charlestown neck , the narrow strip of land connecting charlestown to the rebel positions . on the charlestown side , several companies from other regiments were milling around in disarray , afraid to march into range of the artillery fire . stark ordered the men to stand aside and calmly marched his men to prescott 's positions without taking any casualties . when the new hampshire militia arrived , the grateful colonel prescott allowed stark to deploy his men where he saw fit . stark surveyed the ground and immediately saw that the british would probably try to flank the rebels by landing on the beach of the mystic river , below and to the left of bunker hill . stark led his men to the low ground between mystic beach and the hill and ordered them to '' fortify '' a two-rail fence by stuffing straw and grass between the rails . stark also noticed an additional gap in the defense line and ordered lieutenant nathaniel hutchins from his brother william 's company and others to follow him down a bank to the edge of the mystic river . they piled rocks across the beach to form a crude defense line . after this fortification was hastily constructed , stark deployed his men three-deep behind the wall . a large contingent of british with the royal welch fusiliers in the lead advanced towards the fortifications . the minutemen crouched and waited until the advancing british were almost on top of them , and then stood up and fired as one . they unleashed a fierce and unexpected volley directly into the faces of the fusiliers , killing 90 in the blink of an eye and breaking their advance . the fusiliers retreated in panic . a charge of british infantry was next , climbing over their dead comrades to test stark 's line . this charge too was decimated by a withering fusillade by the minutemen . a third charge was repulsed in a similar fashion , again with heavy losses to the british . the british officers wisely withdrew their men from that landing point and decided to land elsewhere , with the support of artillery . later in the battle , as the rebels were forced from the hill , stark directed the new hampshire regiment 's fire to provide cover for colonel prescott 's retreating troops . the day 's new hampshire dead were later buried in the salem street burying ground , medford , massachusetts . while the british did eventually take the hill that day , their losses were formidable , especially among the officers . after the arrival of general george washington two weeks after the battle , the siege reached a stalemate until march the next year , when cannon seized at the capture of fort ticonderoga were positioned on dorchester heights in a deft night manoeuvre . this placement threatened the british fleet in boston harbor and forced general howe to withdraw all his forces from the boston garrison and sail for halifax , nova scotia . among the notable men who served under stark was captain henry dearborn , who later became secretary of war under president thomas jefferson . dearborn arrived with 60 militia men from new hampshire .

anticipation of a british attack there , he knew that he desperately needed experienced men like john stark to command regiments in the continental army . george washington immediately offered stark a command in the continental army . stark and his new hampshire regiment agreed to attach themselves to the continental army . the men of the new hampshire line were sent as reinforcements to the continental army during the invasion of canada in the spring of 1776 . after the retreat of the continental army from canada , stark and his men traveled to new jersey to join washington 's main army . they were with washington in the battles of princeton and trenton in late 1776 and early 1777 . after trenton , washington asked stark to return to new hampshire to recruit more men for the continental army . stark agreed , but upon returning home , learned that while he had been fighting in new jersey , a fellow new hampshire colonel named enoch poor had been promoted to brigadier general in the continental army . in stark 's opinion , poor had refused to march his militia regiment to bunker hill to join the battle , instead choosing to keep his regiment at home . stark , an experienced woodsman and fighting commander , had been passed over for someone with no combat experience and apparently no will to fight . on march 23 , 1777 , stark resigned his commission in disgust , although he pledged his future aid to new hampshire if it should be needed . bennington and beyond . four months later , his home state offered stark a commission as brigadier general of the new hampshire militia . he accepted on the strict condition that he would not be answerable to continental army authority . soon after receiving his commission , stark assembled 1,492 militiamen in civilian clothes with personal firearms . he traveled to manchester , vermont . at this place , he was ordered by major general benjamin lincoln ( of the continental army ) to reinforce philip schuyler 's continental army on the hudson river . stark refused to obey lincoln , who was another general whom he believed was unfairly promoted over his head . lincoln was diplomatic enough to allow him to operate independently against the rear of general john burgoyne 's british army . boatner , 69 burgoyne sent an expedition under lieutenant colonel friedrich baum to capture american supplies at bennington , vermont . baum commanded 374 brunswick infantry and dismounted dragoons , 300 indians , loyalists , and canadians , and two 3-pound cannons manned by 30 hessians . boatner , 68 stark heard about the raid and marched his force to bennington . meanwhile , baum received intelligence that bennington was held by 1,800 men . on august 14 , baum asked burgoyne for reinforcements but assured his army commander that his opponents would not give him much trouble . boatner , 70 the brunswick officer then fortified his position and waited for lieutenant colonel heinrich von breymann 's 642 soldiers and two 6-pound cannons to reach him . colonel seth warner also set out with his 350 men to reinforce stark . boatner , 72 after waiting out a day of rain , at 3:00 pm on the 16th stark sent 200 militia to the right , 300 men to the left , 200 troops against a position held by tories , and 100 men on a feint against baum 's main redoubt . in the face of these attacks , the indians , loyalists , and canadians fled , leaving baum stranded in his main position . as his envelopment took effect , stark led his remaining 1,200 troops against baum , saying , '' we 'll beat them before night or molly stark 's a widow . '' after an ammunition wagon exploded , baum 's men tried to hack their way out of the trap with their dragoon sabers . baum was fatally hit and his men gave up around 5:00 pm . boatner , 73 with stark 's men somewhat scattered by their victory , breymann 's column appeared on the scene . at this moment colonel seth warner 's 350 green mountain boys arrived to confront breymann 's men . between stark and warner , the germans were stopped and then forced to withdraw . the new hampshire and vermont soldiers severely mauled breymann 's command but the german officer managed to get away with about two-thirds of his force . boatner , 74 historian mark m . boatner wrote , as a commander of new england militia stark had one rare and priceless quality : he knew the limitations of his men . they were innocent of military training , undisciplined , and unenthusiastic about getting shot . with these men he killed over 200 of europe 's vaunted regulars with a loss of 14 americans killed . boatner , 75â€“76 another version has stark rallying his troops with the cry , '' there are your enemies , the red coats and the tories . they are ours , or this night molly stark sleeps a widow ! '' stark 's action contributed to the surrender of burgoyne 's northern army after the battles of saratoga by raising american morale , by keeping the british from getting supplies , and by subtracting several hundred men from the enemy order of battle . stark reported 14 killed and 42 wounded . of baum 's 374 professional soldiers , only nine men escaped . for this feat stark won his coveted promotion to brigadier general in the continental army on october 4 , 1777 . boatner , 76 . boatner also listed 700 captured . saratoga is seen as the turning point in the revolutionary war , as it was the first major defeat of a british general and it convinced the france that the americans were worthy of military aid . after the battle of freeman 's farm gen . stark 's brigade moved into a position at stark 's knob cutting off burgoyne 's retreat to lake george and lake champlain . john stark sat as a judge in the court martial that in september 1780 found british major john andrÃ© guilty of spying and in helping in the conspiracy of benedict arnold to surrender west point to the british . he was the commander of the northern department three times between 1778 and 1781 along with commanding a brigade at the battle of springfield in june 1780 . later years . after serving with distinction throughout the rest of the war , stark retired to his farm in derryfield , renamed manchester in 1810 , where he died on may 8 , 1822 at the age of 93 . it has been said that of all the revolutionary war generals , stark was the only true cincinnatus because he truly retired from public life at the end of the war . in 1809 , a group of bennington veterans gathered to commemorate the battle . general stark , then aged 81 , was not well enough to travel , but he sent a letter to his comrades , which closed '' live free or die : death is not the worst of evils . '' the motto live free or die became the new hampshire state motto in 1945 . stark and the battle of bennington were later commemorated with the tall bennington battle monument and a statue of stark in bennington , vermont . historic sites . there is a new hampshire historical marker ( number 48 ) near john stark 's birthplace on the east side of new hampshire route 28 ( rockingham road ) in derry , new hampshire , just south of the intersection of lawrence road . there is a second stone marker at the actual homestead location . gen . john stark house is located at 2000 elm street in manchester , new hampshire . the home was built in 1736 by john 's father archibald . the building is now owned by the molly stark chapter of the daughters of the american revolution . the property , which is listed on the national register of historic places , is open by appointment only . manchester 's stark park , also a listed property , is home to his grave and is named in his honor . there is a bronze statue of general stark in front of the new hampshire statehouse in concord ; it was dedicated in 1890 . new castle 's fort stark was renamed for the general in 1900 . it was one of seven forts built in the area to protect the nearby city of portsmouth . the historic site is placed on a peninsula known as jerry 's point ( or jaffrey 's point ) on the southeast side of the island . . see also . isaac royall house , stark 's headquarters in medford , massachusetts john stark ( conrads ) fort at number 4 many places in the united states were named after john stark and his wife molly . among them are : fort stark ( new hampshire ) john stark regional high school ( new hampshire ) stark county , illinois stark county , ohio stark mountain ( vermont ) stark 's knob ( new york ) stark , new hampshire stark , new york starke county , indiana starksboro , vermont starkville , colorado starkville , georgia starkville , mississippi starkville , pennsylvania starkville , new york . references . further reading . primary sources . detailed information on john stark is not easy to find . please add references and primary resources to this section , noting where the resources can be found . reminiscences of the french war ; containing rogers ' expeditions with the new-england rangers under his command , as published in london in 1765 ; with notes and illustrations . to which is added an account of the life and military services of maj . gen . john stark ; with notices and anecdotes of other officers distinguished in the french and revolutionary wars . concord , n.h . : published by luther roby , 1831 . a copy can be found in the collections of the american antiquarian society in worcester , massachusetts . reminiscences of the french war with robert rogers ' journal and a memoir of general stark . freedom , n.h . : freedom historical society , 1988 . oclc number : ocm18143265 . a copy can be found in the boston public library . memoir and official correspondence of gen . john stark , with notices of several other officers of the revolution . also a biography of capt . phinehas stevens and of col . robert rogers , with an account of his services in america during the '' seven years ' war .
