Automobiles Alpine

history . early days . using renault 4cvs , rédélé gained class wins in a number of major events , including the mille miglia and coupe des alpes . as his experience with the little 4cv built up , he incorporated many modifications , including for example , special five-speed gearboxes replacing the original three-speed unit . to provide a lighter car he built a number of special versions with lightweight aluminium bodies : he drove in these at le mans and sebring with some success in the early 1950s . encouraged by the development of these cars and consequent customer demand , he created the alpine marque in 1954 . it was named '' alpine '' after his coupe des alpes successes . he did not realise that in england the previous year , sunbeam had introduced a sports coupe derived from the sunbeam talbot and called the '' sunbeam alpine '' . this naming issue was to cause problems for alpine throughout its history . in 1955 , he worked with the chappe brothers to be amongst the pioneers of auto glassfibre construction and produced a small coupe , based on 4cv mechanicals , called the alpine a106 . it used the platform chassis of the original renault 4cv . the a106 achieved a number of successes through the 1950s and was joined by a low and stylish cabriolet . styling for this car was contracted to the italian designer giovanni michelotti . under the glassfibre body was a very stiff chassis based on a central tubular backbone which was to be the hallmark of all alpines . alpine then took the michelotti cabriolet design and developed a 2+2 closed coupe ( or 'berlinette ' ) body for it : this became the alpine a108 , now featuring the renault dauphine 845 cc engine , which on later models was bored out to give a capacity of 904 cc or ( subsequently ) 998 cc . the a108 was built between 1958 and 1963 . 1960s . in 1962 , the a108 began to be produced also in brazil , by willys-overland . it was the willys interlagos ( berlineta , coupé and convertible ) . by now the car 's mechanicals were beginning to show their age in europe . alpine was already working closely with renault and when the renault r8 saloon was introduced in 1962 , alpine redeveloped their chassis and made a number of minor body changes to allow the use of r8 mechanicals . this new car was the alpine a110 tour de france , named after a successful run with the alpine a108 in the 1962 event . starting with a 956 cc engine of , the same chassis and body developed with relatively minor changes over the years to the stage where , by 1974 , the little cars were handling 1800 cc engines developing + . with a competition weight for the car of around , the performance was excellent . alpine achieved increasing success in rallying , and by 1968 had been allocated the whole renault competition budget . the close collaboration allowed alpines to be sold and maintained in france by normal renault dealerships . real top level success started in 1968 with outright wins in the coupe des alpes and other international events . by this time the competition cars were fitted with 1440 cc engines derived from the renault r8 gordini . competition successes became numerous , helped since alpine were the first company fully to exploit the competition parts homologation rules . in 1969 , alpine opened a new assembly plant in dieppe . . 1970s . in 1971 , alpines finished first , second and fourth in the monte carlo rally , using cars with engines derived from the renault 16 . in 1973 , the newer a110 1800 finished first , second , third , and fifth and went on to win the world rally championship outright , beating porsche , lancia and ford . during this time , production of the alpine a110 increased and manufacturing deals were struck for a110s and a108s with factories in a number of other countries including spain , mexico , brazil and bulgaria . with 1973 came the international petrol crisis , which had profound effects on many specialist car manufacturers worldwide . from a total alpine production of 1421 in 1972 , the numbers of cars sold dropped to 957 in 1974 and the company was bailed out via a takeover by renault . alpine 's problems had been compounded by the need for them to develop a replacement for the a110 and launch the car just when european petrol prices leapt through the roof . through the 1970s , alpine continued to campaign the a110 , and later the alpine a310 replacement car . however , to compete with alpine 's success , other manufacturers developed increasingly special cars , notably the lancia stratos which was based closely on the a110 's size and rear-engined concept , though incorporating a ferrari engine . alpine 's own cars , still based on the 1962 design and using a surprising number of production parts , became increasingly uncompetitive . in 1974 alpine built a series of factory racing renault 17 gordinis ( one driven by jean-luc thérier ) that won the press on regardless world rally championship round in michigan , us . in fact , having achieved the rally championship , and with renault money now fully behind them , alpine had set their sights on a new target . the next aim was to win at le mans . renault had also taken over the gordini tuning firm and merged the two to form renault sport . a number of increasingly successful sports racing cars appeared , culminating in the 1978 le mans win with the renault alpine a442b . this was fitted with a turbo-charged engine ; alpine had been the first company to run in and win an international rally with a turbo car as far back as 1972 when thérier took a specially modified a110 to victory on the critérium des cévennes . 1971 also saw alpine begin construction of open-wheel racing cars . initially in formula three within a year they were building formula two cars as well . however , without a competitive renault formula two engine available , the f2 cars could neither be known as renaults nor alpines while powered by ford-cosworth and bmw engines and were labelled elf 2 and later elf 2j . a renault 2.0 litre engine arrived in time for jean-pierre jabouille to win the european formula 2 championship in 1976 . by this time alpine with jabouille driving had built a formula one car as a testing mule which lead directly to their entry into the formula one world championship in 1977 . a second european formula 2 championship followed with rené arnoux in 1977 with the customer martini team , before alpine sold the f2 operation to willi kauhsen to concentrate on the le mans and formula one programs . 1980s . alpine renault continued to develop their range of models all through the 1980s . the a310 was the next modern interpretation of the a110 . the alpine a310 was a sports car with a rear-mounted engine and was initially powered by a four-cylinder 1.6 l sourced renault 17 ts/gordini engine . in 1976 the a310 was restyled by robert opron and fitted with the more powerful and newly developed v6 prv engine . the 2.6 l motor was modified by alpine with a four-speed manual gearbox . later they would use a five-speed manual gearbox and with the group 4 model get a higher tune with more cubic capacity and 3 twin barrel weber carburetors . after the a310 alpine transformed into the new alpine gta range produced from plastic and polyester components , commencing with normally aspirated prv v6 engines . in 1985 the v6 turbo was introduced to complete the range . this car was faster and more powerful than the normally aspirated version . in 1986 polyester parts were cut for the first time by robot using a high pressure ( 3500 bar ) water jet , in diameter at three times the speed of sound . in the same year the american specification v6 turbo was developed . in 1987 the installation of anti-pollution systems allowed the v6 turbo to be distributed to switzerland , germany , austria and the netherlands . 1989 saw the launch of the limited edition gta mille miles to celebrate alpine 's 35th anniversary . production was limited to 100 cars , all fitted with abs braking , polished wheels , special leather interior and paintwork . this version was not available in rhd . 1990s . 1990 saw the launch of the special edition wide-bodied gta le mans . otherwise identical mechanically to the v6 turbo , the engine was fitted with a catalytic converter and power was reduced to . this model was available in the uk and rhd versions carried a numbered plaque on the dashboard . the le mans is the most collectable and valuable gta derivative , since only 325 were made ( 299 lhd and 26 rhd ) . these were available from renault dealers in the uk and the country 's motoring press are belatedly recognising the gta series as the 'great unsung supercar of the 1980s ' . the alpine a610 was launched in 1991 . it was re-styled inside and out but was still recognisable as a gta derivative . the chassis structure was extensively reworked but the central box principal remained the same . the front was completely re-designed the interior was also greatly improved . air-conditioning and power steering were fitted as standard . the total production run for a610s derivatives was 818 vehicles 67 rhd and 751 lhd . after production of the a610 ended , the alpine factory in dieppe produced the renault sport spider and a new era was to begin . the last alpine , an a610 , rolled off the dieppe line on 7 april 1995 , renault abandoning the alpine name . this was always a problem in the uk market . alpines could not be sold in the uk under their own name because sunbeam owned the trade mark ( because of the mid-50s sunbeam alpine mk i ) . in the 1970s , for example dieppe were building modified renault 5s for the worldwide market . the rest of the world knew them as r5 alpines but in the uk they had to be renamed to r5 gordini . with the numerous company takeovers that have occurred , it is another french company , psa peugeot citroën , who now own the british alpine trademark . the alpine factory in dieppe continued to expand ; in the 1980s they built the special r5 turbo cars , following the rear engined formula they have always used . they built all clio williams and renaultsport spiders . the factory put its alpine badges on the early batches of the mid-engined clio series one clio v6 . the clio series 2 was also assembled there with more recent renaultsport clio 172 and renaultsport clio 182s . between 1989 and 1995 , a new alpine named the a710 '' berlinette 2 '' , was designed and two prototypes were built . due to the cost of the project ( 600 million francs ) , and as adding modern equipment and interior would compromise the price and performances , the project was canceled . . present . the dieppe factory is known as the producer of renault sport models that are sold worldwide . this was originally the '' alpine '' factory that renault took over when they acquired the brand in 1973 . some of the renault sport models produced in dieppe are currently the mégane renault sport , clio renault sport and the new mégane renault sport dci is to be built on renault 's dieppe assembly line . all the renaultsport track- , tarmac- and gravel-racing meganes and clios are also made in the dieppe factory . in october 2007 , it was reported that renault 's marketing boss patrick blain had revealed that there were plans for several sports cars in renault 's future lineup , but stressed that the first model would not arrive until after 2010 . blain confirmed that renault was unlikely to pick a new name for its future sports car and would probably go with alpine to brand it . blain described it as being a “ radical sports car ” and not just a sports version of a regular model . motor authority alpine brand revived ! monday 8 october 2007 the new alpine sports car was to have a version of the nissan gt-r 's premium midship platform . in france , there is a large network of alpine enthusiasts clubs . clubs exist in many countries including the uk , usa , australia , and japan . in february 2009 , renault confirmed that plans to revive the alpine brand have been frozen as a direct result of the 2008–2009 global financial crisis and recession . in may 2012 , images of a new renault alpine concept titled as renault alpine a110-50 were leaked prior to its debut in monaco . its styling was based on the renault dezir presented in

venture ( société des automobiles alpine caterham or saac ) owned equally by both parts , with the aim of developing affordable sport cars under the alpine ( for renault ) and caterham ( for caterham cars ) brands , which would be available in 2016 . in this partnership , caterham acquired 50 % ownership of the renault 's dieppe assembly plant assets . on 10 june 2014 , renault announced it would be repurchasing the stake from caterham cars in saac , renaming it société des automobiles alpine . during 2015 , two new alpine concepts were introduced : the alpine celebration , unveiled at the le mans race weekend , and the cgi-created alpine vision gran turismo . in february 2016 , at an event held in monte carlo , groupe renault 's chief carlos ghosn unveiled the alpine vision showcar ( a model close to the planned production alpine ) and announced a 2017 relaunch for the alpine marque . the vision was later presented at the geneva motor show by alpine . the production version is to
