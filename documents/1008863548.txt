Kim Duk-koo

early life and education . kim was born in gangwon province , south korea , 100 miles east of seoul , the youngest of five children . his father died when he was two and his mother married three more times . kim grew up poor . he worked odd jobs such as a shoe-shining boy and a tour guide before getting into boxing in 1976 . career . after compiling a 29–4 amateur record , he turned professional in 1978 . in february 1982 , he won the orient and pacific boxing federation lightweight title and became the world boxing association 's number 1 contender . kim carried a 17–1–1 professional record into the mancini fight '' then all the joy turned to sorrow '' , ralph wiley , sports illustrated , november 22 , 1982 and had won 8 bouts by ko before flying to las vegas as the world 's ( wba ) number 1 challenger to world lightweight champion mancini . however , he had fought outside of south korea only once before , in the philippines . it was his first time ever fighting in north america . . mancini match . kim was lightly regarded by the u.s . boxing establishment , but not by ray mancini , who believed the fight would be a '' war '' . kim struggled to lose weight in the days prior to the bout so that he could weigh in under the lightweight 's 135-pound limit . before the fight , kim was quoted as saying '' either he dies or i die . '' he wrote the message '' live or die '' on his las vegas hotel lampshade only days before the bout ( a mistaken translation led to '' kill or be killed '' being reported in the media ) . mancini and kim met in an arena outside caesars palace on november 13 , 1982 ( the night after aaron pryor defeated alexis arguello ) . they went toe to toe for a good portion of the bout , to the point that mancini briefly considered quitting . kim tore open mancini 's left ear and puffed up his left eye , and mancini 's left hand swelled to twice its normal size . after the fight mancini 's left eye would be completely closed . however , by the latter rounds , mancini began to dominate , landing many more punches than kim . in the 11th he buckled kim 's knees . in the beginning of the 13th round mancini charged kim with a flurry of 39 punches but had little effect . sugar ray leonard ( working as one of the commentators of the fight ) said kim came right back very strong . leonard later declared the round to be closely contested . when the fighters came out for the 14th round , mancini charged forward and hit kim with a right . kim reeled back , mancini missed with a left , and then mancini hit kim with another hard right hand . kim went flying into the ropes , his head hitting the canvas . kim managed to rise unsteadily to his feet , but referee richard green stopped the fight and mancini was declared the winner by tko nineteen seconds into the 14th round . ralph wiley of sports illustrated , covering the fight , would later recall kim pulling himself up the ropes as he was dying as '' one of the greatest physical feats i had ever witnessed '' . minutes after the fight was over , kim collapsed into a coma and was removed from the caesars palace arena on a stretcher and taken to the desert springs hospital . at the hospital , he was found to have a subdural hematoma consisting of 100 cubic centimeters of blood in his skull . emergency brain surgery was performed at the hospital to try to save him , but kim died five days after the bout , on november 18 . the neurosurgeon said it was caused by one punch . the week after , sports illustrated published a photo of the fight on its cover , under the heading tragedy in the ring . the profile of the incident was heightened by the fight having been televised live by cbs in the united states . kim had never fought a 15-round bout before . in contrast , mancini was much more experienced at the time . he had fought 15-round bouts thrice and gone on to round 14 once before . kim compiled a record of 17 wins with two losses and one draw . eight of kim 's wins were knockouts . aftermath of kim 's death . mancini went through a period of reflection , as he blamed himself for kim 's death . after friends helped him by telling him that it was just an accident , mancini went on with his career , though still haunted by kim 's death . his promoter , bob arum , said mancini '' was never the same '' after kim 's death . two years later , mancini lost his title to livingstone bramble . four weeks after the fatal fight , the mike weaver vs . michael dokes fight at the same caesars palace venue ended with a technical knockout declared 63 seconds into the fight . referee joey curtis admitted to stopping the fight early under orders of the nevada state athletic commission , which required referees to be aware of a fighter 's health , in light of the mancinikim fight , and a rematch was ordered . kim 's mother flew from south korea to las vegas to be with her son before the life support equipment was turned off . three months later , she committed suicide by drinking a bottle of pesticide . the bout 's referee , richard green , committed suicide via self-inflicted gunshot wound on july 1 , 1983 . kim left behind a fiancée , lee young-mee , despite rules against south korean boxers having girlfriends . at the time of kim 's death , lee was pregnant with their son , kim chi-wan , who was born in july 1983 . kim chi-wan became a dentist . in 2011 , kim chi-wan and his mother had a meeting with ray mancini as part of a documentary on the life of mancini called the good son . in popular culture , the san francisco-based band sun kil moon ’ s first album , ghosts of the great highway , has three tracks named after boxers , including a song about duk-koo kim which references the mancini fight ; sports illustrated included the song on its list of greatest songs about sports . . boxing rule changes . the nevada state athletic commission proposed a series of rule changes as a result , announcing it before a december 10 match between michael dokes and mike weaver that would in itself be disputed because of what officials were informed before the fight . the break between rounds was initially proposed to go from 60 to 90 seconds ( but it was later rescinded ) . the standing eight count ( which allows a knockdown to be called even if the boxer is not down , but on the verge of being knocked down ) was imposed , and new rules regarding suspension of licence were imposed ( 45 days after a knockout loss ) . the wbc , which was not the fight 's sanctioning organization , announced during its annual convention of 1982 that many rules concerning fighters ' medical care before fights needed to be changed . one of the most significant was the wbc 's reduction of title fights from 15 rounds to 12 . the wba and the ibf followed the wbc in 1987 . when the wbo was formed in 1988 , it immediately began operating with 12-round world championship bouts . in the years after kim 's death , new medical procedures were introduced to fighters ' pre-fight checkups , such as electrocardiograms , brain tests , and lung tests . as one boxing leader put it , '' a fighter 's check-ups before fights used to consist of blood pressure and heartbeat checks before 1982 . not anymore .
