Dexter Gordon

life and career . early life . dexter keith gordon was born on february 27 , 1923 in los angeles , california . his father , dr . frank gordon , one of the first african american doctors in los angeles , arrived in 1918 after graduating from howard university medical school in washington , d.c . among his patients were duke ellington and lionel hampton . dexter 's mother , gwendolyn baker , was the daughter of captain edward lee baker , jr . one of the five african american medal of honor recipients in the spanish–american war . gordon played clarinet from the age of 13 , before switching to saxophone ( initially alto , then tenor ) at 15 . while still at school , he played in bands with such contemporaries as chico hamilton and buddy collette . joop visser , essay booklet with settin ' the pace , proper box set . between december 1940 and 1943 , gordon was a member of lionel hampton 's band , playing in a saxophone section alongside illinois jacquet and marshal royal . during 1944 he was featured in the fletcher henderson band , followed by the louis armstrong band , before joining billy eckstine . the 1942–44 musicians ' strike curtailed the recording of the hampton , henderson , and armstrong bands ; however , they were recorded on v-discs produced by the army for broadcast and distribution among overseas troops . in 1943 he was featured , alongside harry edison , in recordings under nat cole for a small label not affected by the strike . bebop era recordings . by late 1944 , gordon was resident in new york , a regular at bebop jam sessions , and a featured soloist in the billy eckstine big band ( if that 's the way you feel , i want to talk about you , blowin ' the blues away , opus x , i 'll wait and pray , the real thing happened to me , lonesome lover blues , i love the rhythm in a riff ) . during early 1945 he was featured on recordings by dizzy gillespie ( blue ' n ' boogie , groovin ' high ) and sir charles thompson ( takin ' off , if i had you , 20th century blues , the street beat ) . in late 1945 he was recording under his own name for the savoy label . his savoy recordings during 1945-46 included blow mr . dexter , dexter 's deck , dexter 's minor mad , long tall dexter , dexter rides again , i ca n't escape from you , and dexter digs in . he returned to los angeles in late 1946 and in 1947 was leading sessions for ross russell 's dial label ( mischievous lady , lullaby in rhythm , the chase , iridescence , it 's the talk of the town , bikini , a ghost of a chance , sweet and lovely ) . after his return to los angeles , he became known for his saxophone duels with fellow tenorman wardell gray , which were a popular concert attraction documented in recordings made between 1947 and 1952 ( the hunt , move , the chase , the steeplechase ) . the hunt gained literary fame from its mention in jack kerouac 's on the road , which also contains descriptions of wild tenormen jamming in los angeles . cherokee , byas a drink , and disorder at the border are other live recordings of the gray/gordon duo from the same concert as the hunt . in december 1947 , gordon recorded again with the savoy label ( settin ' the pace , so easy , dexter 's riff , dextrose , dexter 's mood , index , dextivity , wee dot , lion roars ) . through the mid-to-late 1940s he continued to work as a sideman on sessions led by russell jacquet , benny carter , ben webster , ralph burns , jimmy rushing , helen humes , gerry mulligan , wynonie harris , leo parker , and tadd dameron . the 1950s . during the 1950s , gordon 's recorded output and live appearances declined as heroin addiction and legal troubles took their toll . gordon made a concert appearance with wardell gray in february 1952 ( the chase , the steeplechase , take the a train , robbins nest , stardust ) and appeared as a sideman in a session led by gray in june 1952 ( the rubiyat , jungle jungle jump , citizen 's bop , my kinda love ) . after an incarceration at chino prison during 1953-55 , he recorded the albums daddy plays the horn and dexter blows hot and cool in 1955 and played as a sideman on the stan levey album , this time the drum 's on me . the latter part of the decade saw him in and out of prison until his final release from folsom prison in 1959 . he was one of the initial sax players for the onzy matthews big band in 1959 , along with curtis amy . gordon continued to champion matthews ' band after he left los angeles for new york , but left for europe before getting a chance to record with that band . he recorded the resurgence of dexter gordon in 1960 . his recordings from the mid-1950s onward document a meander into a smooth west coast style that lacked the impact of his bebop era recordings or his subsequent blue note recordings . the decade saw gordon 's first entry into the world of drama . he appeared as a member ( uncredited ) of art hazzard 's band in the 1950 film young man with a horn . he appeared in an uncredited and overdubbed role as a member of a prison band in the movie unchained , filmed inside chino . gordon was a saxophonist performing freddie redd 's music for the los angeles production of jack gelber 's play the connection in 1960 , replacing jackie mclean . he contributed two compositions , ernie 's tune and i want more to the score and later recorded them for his album dexter calling . new york renaissance . gordon signed to blue note records in 1961 . he initially commuted from los angeles to new york to record , but took up residence when he regained the cabaret card that allowed him to perform where alcohol was served . the jazz gallery hosted his first new york performance in twelve years . the blue note association was to produce a steady flow of albums for several years , some of which gained iconic status . his new york renaissance was marked by doin ' allright , dexter calling . , go ! , and a swingin ' affair . the first two were recorded over three days in may 1961 with freddie hubbard , horace parlan , kenny drew , paul chambers , george tucker , al harewood , and philly joe jones . the last two were recorded in august 1962 , with a rhythm section that featured blue note regulars sonny clark , butch warren and billy higgins . of the two go ! was an expressed favorite . the albums showed his assimilation of the hard bop and modal styles that had developed during his years on the west coast , and the influence of john coltrane and sonny rollins , whom he had influenced before . the stay in new york turned out to be short lived , as gordon got offers for engagements in england , then europe , that resulted in a fourteen-year stay . soon after recording a swingin ' affair , he was gone . years in europe . over the next 14 years in europe , living mainly in paris and copenhagen , gordon played regularly with fellow expatriates or visiting players , such as bud powell , ben webster , freddie hubbard , bobby hutcherson , kenny drew , horace parlan and billy higgins . blue note 's german-born francis wolff supervised gordon 's later sessions for the label on his visits to europe . the pairing of gordon with drew turned out to be one of the classic matchups between a horn player and a pianist , much like miles davis with red garland or john coltrane with mccoy tyner . from this period come our man in paris , one flight up , gettin ' around , and clubhouse . our man in paris was a blue note session recorded in paris in 1963 with backup consisting of pianist powell , drummer kenny clarke , and french bassist pierre michelot . one flight up , recorded in paris in 1964 with trumpeter donald byrd , pianist kenny drew , drummer art taylor , and danish bassist niels-henning ørsted pedersen , features an extended solo by gordon on the track '' tanya '' . gordon also visited the us occasionally for further recording dates . gettin ' around was recorded for blue note during a visit in may 1965 , as was the album clubhouse which remained unreleased until 1979 . gordon found europe in the 1960s a much easier place to live , saying that he experienced less racism and greater respect for jazz musicians . he also stated that on his visits to the us in the late 1960s and early 1970s , he found the political and social strife disturbing . while in copenhagen , gordon and drew 's trio appeared onscreen '' dexter gordon & kenny drew – pornography a musical ( 1971 ) ost '' , youtube video . in ole ege 's theatrically released hardcore pornographic film pornografi ( 1971 ) , for which they composed and performed the score . david meeker , '' jazz on the screen – a jazz and blues filmography '' , library of congress , performing arts encyclopedia . he switched from blue note to prestige records ( 1965–73 ) but stayed very much in the hard-bop idiom , making classic bop albums like the tower of power ! and more power ! ( 1969 ) with james moody , barry harris , buster williams , and albert '' tootie '' heath ; the panther ! ( 1970 ) with tommy flanagan , larry ridley , and alan dawson ; the jumpin ' blues ( 1970 ) with wynton kelly , sam jones , and roy brooks ; the chase ! ( 1970 ) with gene ammons , jodie christian , john young , cleveland eaton , rufus reid , wilbur campbell , steve mccall , and vi redd ; and tangerine ( 1972 ) with thad jones , freddie hubbard , and hank jones . some of the prestige albums were recorded during visits back to north america while he was still living in europe ; others were made in europe , including live sets from the montreux jazz festival . in addition to the recordings gordon did under his major label contracts , live recordings by european labels and live video from his european period are available . the danish label steeplechase released live dates from his mid-1960s tenure at the montmartre jazzhus . the video was released under the jazz icons series . less well known than the blue note albums , but of similar quality , are the albums he recorded during the 1970s for steeplechase ( something different , bouncin ' with dex , biting the apple , the apartment , stable mable , the shadow of your smile and others ) . they again feature american sidemen , but also such europeans as spanish pianist tete montoliu and niels-henning ørsted pedersen . homecoming . gordon finally returned to the united states for good in 1976 . he appeared with woody shaw , ronnie mathews , stafford james , and louis hayes , for a gig at the village vanguard in new york that was dubbed his '' homecoming . '' it was recorded and released by columbia records under that title . he noted : '' there was so much love and elation ; sometimes it was a little eerie at the vanguard . after the last set they 'd turn on the lights and nobody would move . '' in addition to the homecoming album , a series of live albums was released by blue note from his stands at keystone corner in san francisco during 1978 and 1979 . they featured gordon , george cables , rufus reid , and eddie gladden . he recorded the studio albums sophisticated giant with an eleven piece big band in 1977 and manhattan symphonie with the live at keystone corner crew in 1978 . the sensation of gordon 's return , renewed promotion of the classic jazz catalogs of the savoy and blue note record labels , and the continued efforts of art blakey through 1970s and early 1980s , have been credited with reviving interest in swinging , melodic , acoustically-based classic jazz sounds after the fusion jazz era that saw an emphasis on electronic sounds and contemporary pop influences . musician emeritus . in 1978 and 1980 , gordon was the downbeat musician of the year and in 1980 he was inducted into the jazz hall of fame . the us government honored him with a congressional commendation , a dexter gordon day in washington dc , and a national endowment for the arts award for lifetime achievement . in 1986 , he was named a member and officer of the french order of arts and letters by the ministry of culture in france . during the 1980s , gordon was weakened by emphysema . he remained a popular attraction at concerts and festivals , although his live appearances and recording dates would soon become infrequent . gordon 's most memorable works from the decade were not in music but in film . he starred in the 1986 movie round midnight as '' dale turner '' , an expatriate jazz musician in paris during the late 1950s based loosely on lester young and bud powell . that portrayal earned him a nomination for an academy award for best actor . in addition , he had a non-speaking role in the 1990 film awakenings , which was posthumously released . before that last film was released he made a guest appearance on the michael mann series crime story . soundtrack performances from round midnight were released as the albums round midnight and the other side of round midnight , featuring original music by herbie hancock as well as playing by gordon . the latter was the last recording released under gordon 's name . he was a sideman on tony bennett 's 1987 album , berlin . death . gordon died of kidney failure and cancer of the larynx in philadelphia , on april 25 , 1990 , at the age of 67 . - obituary in the new york times . material loss . on june 25 , 2019 , the new york times magazine listed dexter gordon among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 universal fire . . family . gordon 's maternal grandfather was captain edward l . baker , who received the medal of honor during the spanish–american war , while serving with the 10th cavalry regiment ( also known as the buffalo soldiers ) . gordon 's father , dr . frank gordon , m.d . , was one of the first prominent african-american physicians and a graduate of howard university . dexter gordon had a total of six children , from the oldest to the youngest : robin gordon ( los angeles ) , california , james canales ( los angeles ) , deidre ( dee dee ) gordon ( los angeles ) , mikael gordon-solfors ( stockholm ) , morten gordon ( copenhagen ) and benjamin dexter gordon ( copenhagen ) , and seven grandchildren , raina moore trider ( brooklyn ) , jared johnson ( los angeles ) , and matthew johnson ( los angeles ) , maya canales ( san francisco ) and jared canales ( san francisco ) , dexter gordon bogs ( copenhagen ) , dexter minou flipper gordon-marberger ( stockholm ) . when he lived in denmark , gordon became friends with the family of the future metallica drummer lars ulrich , and subsequently became lars 's godfather . joel mciver , justice for all : the truth about metallica , omnibus press , 2004 . gordon was also survived by his widow maxine gordon and her son woody louis armstrong shaw iii . instruments and mouthpieces . the earliest photographs of gordon as a player show him with a conn 30m '' connqueror '' and an otto link mouthpiece . in a 1962 interview with the british journalist les tomkins , he did not refer to the specific model of mouthpiece but stated that it was made for him personally . he stated that it was stolen around 1952 . the famous smoke break photo from 1948 shows him with a conn 10m and a dukoff mouthpiece , which he played until 1965 . in the tomkins interview he referred to his mouthpiece as a medium-chambered piece with a 5 ( . 090 '' under the dukoff system ) tip opening . he bought a selmer mark vi from ben webster after his 10m went missing in transit . in a down beat magazine interview from 1977 , he referred to his current mouthpiece as an otto link with a 8 ( . 110 '' under the otto link system ) tip opening . . discography . as a leader . dexter rides again ( 1947 78 album ;
