Alan Lightman

early life and education . alan lightman was born and grew up in memphis , tennessee . his father richard lightman was a movie theater owner and played a major role in desegregating movie theaters in the south in 1962 . his mother jeanne garretson was a dance teacher and braille typist . early on , lightman demonstrated an interest in both the sciences and the arts by winning city and state science fairs as well as being a state winner of the national council of teachers of english award . he graduated from white station high school . he graduated phi beta kappa with an a.b . in physics from princeton university in 1970 after completing a senior thesis , titled '' design and construction of a gas scintillation detector capable of time-of-flight measurements of fission isomer decays '' , under the supervision of robert naumann . he then received a ph.d . in physics from the california institute of technology in 1974 after completing a doctoral dissertation , titled '' i . time-dependent accretion disks around compact objects . ii . theoretical frameworks for analyzing and testing gravitation theories '' , under the supervision of kip thorne . . career . lightman was a postdoctoral fellow in astrophysics at cornell university ( 1974-1976 ) ; an assistant professor at harvard university ( 1976-1979 ) ; a senior research scientist at the harvard smithsonian center for astrophysics ( 1979-1989 ) ; and then a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) ( 1989 - ) . during this period he began publishing poetry in small magazines and eventually essays in science 80 , the smithsonian , the new yorker , and other magazines . at mit , in the mid 1990s lightman chaired the committee that established the communication requirement for all undergraduates . in 2005 , he was a cofounder of the catalyst collaborative at mit , a partnership between mit and central square theater , in cambridge , that sponsors plays involving science and the culture of science . in the same year , lightman cofounded the graduate program in science writing at mit . scientific work . in his scientific work , lightman has made contributions to the theory of astrophysical processes under extreme temperatures and densities . in particular , his research has focused on relativistic gravitation theory , the structure and behavior of accretion disks , stellar dynamics , radiative processes , and relativistic plasmas . some of his significant achievements are his discovery , with douglas eardley , of a structural instability in orbiting disks of matter , called accretion disks , that form around massive condensed objects such as black holes , with wide application in astronomy ; astrophysical journal letters , vol . 187 , pg . l1 ( 1974 ) his proof , with david l . lee , that all gravitation theories obeying the weak equivalence principle ( the experimentally verified fact that all objects fall with the same acceleration in a gravitational field ) must be metric theories of gravity , that is , must describe gravity as a geometrical warping of time and space ; physical review d , vol . 8 , pg . 364 ( 1973 ) his calculations , with stuart l . shapiro , of the distribution of stars around a massive black hole and the rate of destruction of those stars by the hole ; astrophysical journal , vol . 211 , pg . 244 ( 1977 ) his discovery , independently of roland svensson of sweden , of the negative heat behavior of optically thin , hot thermal plasmas dominated by electron-positron pairs , that is , the result that adding energy to thin hot gases causes their temperature to decrease rather than increase ; astrophysical journal , vol . 253 , pg . 842 ( 1982 ) and his work on unusual radiation processes , such as unsaturated inverse compton scattering , in thermal media , also with wide application in astrophysics . nature , vol . 262 , pg . 196 ( 1976 ) his research articles have appeared in physical review , the astrophysical journal , reviews of modern physics , nature , and other journals . in 1990 he chaired the science panel of the national academy of sciences astronomy and astrophysics survey committee . he is a past chair of the high energy division of the american astronomical society . literary work . lightman 's essays , articles , and stories have appeared in the atlantic , harper 's magazine , nautilus , the new yorker , the new york times and many other publications . his books include : . fiction . einstein 's dreams ( 1993 ) good benito ( 1995 ) the diagnosis ( 2000 ) reunion ( 2003 )

university in phnom penh in the mid 1990s , she and a handful of female students lived underneath the university building , in the two-meter crawl space between the bottom of the building and the mud , because there was no housing for female university students . lightman and chea together conceived the idea of a dormitory for female university students in phnom penh . that first facility was completed in 2006 , the first dormitory for college women in the country . during this work , lightman founded harpswell , a nonprofit organization whose mission is to advance a new generation of women leaders in southeast asia . harpswell now operates two dormitory and leadership centers in phnom penh . in addition to providing free housing , food , and medical care , the facility gives outstanding young women a rigorous in-house program in leadership skills and critical thinking . the in-house program includes english instruction , computer literacy , debate , analytical writing , comparative genocide studies , strategies for civic engagement , leadership training , and discussion and analysis of national and international events . as of fall 2019 , the cambodian program has about 180 graduates and about 76 current students . harpswell graduates are advancing into leadership positions as project managers at ngos , lawyers , businesswomen , journalists , engineers , health care workers , teachers and professors , government staff , and bankers . in 2017 , harpswell launched a new program in leadership for young professional women from all ten countries of southeast asia : laos , myanmar , thailand , vietnam , cambodia , malaysia , the philippines , indonesia , singapore , and brunei , plus nepal . the harpswell-asean program in women 's leadership consists of an intense , two week summer program in penang malaysia , with lectures and workshops in critical thinking , civic engagement , southeast asian geography and society , technology and communication , and gender issues . the program has a total of 25 participants each year , who are flown to penang from their respective countries . major awards and honors . honorary doctoral degrees from bowdoin college ( 2005 ) , memphis college of art ( 2006 ) , university of maryland ( 2006 ) , university of massachusetts ( 2010 ) , colgate university ( 2017 ) , and skidmore college ( 2019 ) certificate of special congressional recognition on september 23 , 2019 , from the united states house of representatives for contributions to the global cambodian community . inaugural winner of 2017 humanism in
