Wide-body aircraft

history . following the success of the boeing 707 and douglas dc-8 in the late 1950s and early 1960s , airlines began seeking larger aircraft to meet the rising global demand for air travel . engineers were faced with many challenges as airlines demanded more passenger seats per aircraft , longer ranges and lower operating costs . early jet aircraft such as the 707 and dc-8 seated passengers along either side of a single aisle , with no more than six seats per row . larger aircraft would have to be longer , higher ( such as a double-deck ) , or wider in order to accommodate a greater number of passenger seats . engineers realized having two decks created difficulties in meeting emergency evacuation regulations with the technology available at that time . during the 1960s , it was also believed that supersonic airliners would succeed larger , slower planes . thus , it was believed that most subsonic aircraft would become obsolete for passenger travel and would be eventually converted to freighters . as a result , airline manufacturers opted for a wider fuselage rather than a taller one ( the 747 , and eventually the dc-10 and l-1011 ) . by adding a second aisle , the wider aircraft could accommodate as many as 10 seats across , but could also be easily converted to a freighter and carry two eight-by-eight freight pallets abreast . the engineers also opted for creating '' stretched '' versions of the dc-8 ( 61 , 62 and 63 models ) , as well as longer versions of boeing 's 707 ( -320b and 320c models ) and 727 ( -200 model ) ; and douglas ' dc-9 ( -30 , -40 , and -50 models ) , all of which were capable of accommodating more seats than their shorter predecessor versions . the wide-body age began in 1970 with the entry into service of the first wide-body airliner , the four-engined , partial double-deck boeing 747 . rumerman , judy . '' the boeing 747 '' , u.s . centennial of flight commission . retrieved : 30 april 2006 . new trijet wide-body aircraft soon followed , including the mcdonnell douglas dc-10 and the lockheed l-1011 tristar . the first wide-body twinjet , the airbus a300 , entered service in 1974 . this period came to be known as the '' wide-body wars '' . l-1011 tristars were demonstrated in the ussr in 1974 , as lockheed sought to sell the aircraft to aeroflot . however , in 1976 the soviet union launched its own first four-engined wide-body , the ilyushin il-86 . after the success of the early wide-body aircraft , several subsequent designs came to market over the next two decades , including the boeing 767 and 777 , the airbus a330 and a340 , and the mcdonnell douglas md-11 . in the '' jumbo '' category , the capacity of the boeing 747 was not surpassed until october 2007 , when the airbus a380 entered commercial service with the nickname '' superjumbo '' . both the boeing 747 and airbus a380 '' jumbo jets '' have four engines each ( quad-jets ) , but the upcoming boeing 777x ( '' mini jumbo jet '' ) is a twinjet . in the mid-2000s , rising oil costs in a post-9/11 climate caused airlines to look towards newer , more fuel-efficient aircraft . two such examples are the boeing 787 dreamliner and airbus a350 xwb . the proposed comac c929 and c939 may also share this new wide-body market . the production of the large boeing 747-8 and airbus a380 four-engine , long-haul jets is being cut back as airlines are now preferring the smaller , more efficient a350 , 787 and 777 twin-engine , long-range airliners . . design considerations . fuselage . although wide-body aircraft have larger frontal areas ( and thus greater form drag ) than narrow-body aircraft of similar capacity , they have several advantages over their narrow-body counterparts , such as : a larger cabin space for passengers , giving a more open feeling a lower ratio of surface area to volume , and thus lower drag per passenger or cargo volume . the only exception to this would be with very long narrow-body aircraft , such as the boeing 757 and airbus a321 . twin aisles that accelerate loading , unloading , and evacuation compared to a single aisle ( wide-body airliners typically have 3.5 to 5 seats abreast per aisle , compared to 5–6 on most narrow-body aircraft ) reduced overall aircraft length for a given capacity , improving ground manoeuvrability and reducing the risk of tailstrike . greater under-floor freight capacity better structural efficiency for larger aircraft than would be possible with a narrow-body design british and russian designers had proposed wide-body aircraft similar in configuration to the vickers vc10 and douglas dc-9 , but with a wide-body fuselage . the british three-eleven project never left the drawing board , while the russian il-86 wide-body proposal eventually gave way to a more conventional wing-mounted engine design , most likely due to the inefficiencies of mounting such large engines on the aft fuselage . engines . as jet engine power and reliability have increased over the last decades , most of the wide-body aircraft built today have only two engines . a twinjet design is more fuel-efficient than a trijet or quadjet of similar size . the increased reliability of modern jet engines also allows aircraft to meet the etops certification standard , which calculates reasonable safety margins for flights across oceans . the trijet design was dismissed due to higher maintenance and fuel costs compared to a twinjet . most modern wide-body aircraft have two engines , although the heaviest wide-body aircraft are built with four engines : the airbus a380 , boeing 747-8 . the upcoming boeing 777x-9 twinjet is approaching the capacity of the earlier boeing 747 . the boeing 777 twinjet features the most powerful jet engine , the general electric ge90 . the early variants have a fan diameter of , and the larger ge90-115b has a fan diameter of . this is almost as wide as the fokker 100 fuselage . complete ge90 engines can only be ferried by outsize cargo aircraft such as the antonov an-124 , presenting logistics problems if a 777 is stranded in a place due to emergency diversions without the proper spare parts . if the fan is removed from the core , then the engines may be shipped on a boeing 747 freighter . the general electric ge9x , powering the boeing 777x , is wider than the ge90 by . the maximum takeoff weight of the airbus a380 would not have been possible without the engine technology developed for the boeing 777 such as contra-rotating spools . its trent 900 engine has a fan diameter of , slightly smaller than the ge90 engines on the boeing 777 . the trent 900 is designed to fit into a boeing 747-400f freighter for easier transport by air cargo . . interior . the interiors of aircraft , known as the aircraft cabin , have been undergoing evolution since the first passenger aircraft . today , between one and four travel class are available on wide-body aircraft . bar and lounge areas which were once installed on wide-body aircraft have mostly disappeared , but a few have returned in first class or business class on the airbus a340-600 , 777-300er , and on the airbus a380 . emirates has installed showers for first-class passengers on the a380 ; twenty-five minutes are allotted for use of the room , and the shower operates for a maximum of five minutes . depending on how the airline configures the aircraft , the size and seat pitch of the airline seats will vary significantly . for example , aircraft scheduled for shorter flights are often configured at a higher seat density than long-haul aircraft . due to current economic pressures on the airline industry , high seating densities in the economy class cabin are likely to continue . in some of the largest single-deck wide-body aircraft , such as the boeing 777 , the extra space above the cabin is used for crew rest areas and galley storage . a comparison of interior cabin widths and economy class seating layouts is shown below under wide-body specifications . further information can be found under

categorized by icao according to the wake turbulence they produce . because wake turbulence is generally related to the weight of an aircraft , these categories are based on one of four weight categories : light , medium , heavy , and super . due to their weight , all current wide-body aircraft are categorized as '' heavy '' , or in the case of the a380 in u.s . airspace , '' super '' . the wake-turbulence category also is used to guide the separation of aircraft . super- and heavy-category aircraft require greater separation behind them than those in other categories . in some countries , such as the united states , it is a requirement to suffix the aircraft 's call sign with the word heavy ( or super ) when communicating with air traffic control in certain areas . special uses . wide-body aircraft are used in science , research , and the military . some wide-body aircraft are used as flying command posts by the military like the ilyushin il-80 or the boeing e-4 , while the boeing e-767 is used for airborne early warning and control . new military weapons are tested aboard wide-bodies , as in the laser weapons testing on the boeing yal-1 . other wide-body aircraft are used as flying research stations , such as the joint german–u.s . stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia ) . airbus a340 , airbus a380 , and boeing 747 four-engine wide-body aircraft are used to test new generations of aircraft engines in flight . a few aircraft have also been converted for aerial firefighting , such as the dc-10-based tanker 910 and the 747-based evergreen supertanker . some wide-body aircraft are used as vip transport . canada uses the airbus a310 , while russia use the ilyushin il-96 , to transport those holding the highest offices . germany replaced their airbus a310 with an airbus a340 in spring 2011 . specially-modified boeing 747-200s ( boeing vc-25s ) are used to ferry the president of the united states . outsize cargo . some wide-body aircraft have been modified to enable transport of especially large cargo . examples include the airbus beluga , airbus beluga xl , and the boeing dreamlifter . two shuttle carrier aircraft were used to transport the u.s . space shuttle , while the antonov an-225 was initially built to carry the buran . comparison . see also . aircraft seat map competition between airbus and boeing large aircraft
