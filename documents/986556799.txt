The Bobby Fuller Four

history . even before fuller had established a band in his hometown of el paso , he recorded his first single , '' you 're in love '' , under yucca records in 1961 with assistance of the embers , a local band that fuller played in previously . at this point , he started his own band , backed by his brother randy on bass and gaylord grimes on drums in 1962 . after '' you 're in love '' was a regional hit , fuller had his next single , '' gently my love '' professionally recorded at norman petty recording studios . while producing another regional hit , fuller was displeased with the results . they disengaged from yucca , and released their records through fuller 's own various independent labels ; the recordings were done in fuller 's home recording studio . the group never had a definite name ; recordings were either credited to simply bobby fuller , or bobby fuller and the fanatics . various other members ( now including a second guitarist in addition to fuller ) played in the band at this time ; however , the most significant were jim reese ( formerly of the embers ) on guitar , and dalton powell ( who had previously played piano for the embers ) on drums , while bobby fuller and randy fuller stayed constant on guitar and bass , respectively . by 1963 , the band pursued a record deal with a major label in hollywood , california . while they were neglected by most labels , bob keane of del-fi records showed particular interest in the group . while he saw potential , he did n't think the band had hit material yet . fuller and his band returned to el paso and continued to release regional hits , the most popular being '' i fought the law , '' originally by the crickets . by the end of 1964 , fuller saw branching out to a major label as their only option , thus bobby fuller , randy fuller , and jim reese prepared to move to california to revisit del-fi records . current drummer dalton powell could not make the move due to family commitments , and was replaced by another drummer , dewayne quirico , instructed by fuller in person . del-fi records . with the group 's new hit records , keane signed them to del-fi this time around . the band 's first del-fi release , '' those memories of you '' was under the sister label , donna records ( credited to bobby fuller and the fanatics ) . with the band 's increasing local popularity , keane created a sister label just for fuller 's band , mustang records . the first release on mustang was '' thunder reef '' in 1965 . this time , the band was credited as the shindigs to capitalize on the new abc show , shindig ! seeking a more permanent name , keane decided upon the bobby fuller four ( as he favored fuller ) , which was first used on the band 's next single , '' take my word . '' the new name received mixed reactions with the rest of the group , claiming that it put too much emphasis on fuller , as opposed to the rest of the band , but the name stuck . while their next release , '' never to be forgotten '' brought a regional hit , the band 's next single , '' let her dance '' brought the band 's first national hit , barely missing the billboard hot 100 at 133 , though bringing in a top 40 hit . at the suggestion of randy fuller , the el paso hit , '' i fought the law '' was re-recorded . it quickly gained national popularity , and by 1966 , it rose to its peak position at 9 on the national charts . meanwhile , the band was starting to experience internal troubles after touring , and drummer dewayne quirico abruptly left the group . john barbata was asked to take his place , while negotiations were underway to get dalton powell back in the band . with powell reinstated , the group went on to release '' love 's made a fool of you , '' another crickets cover ( written by buddy holly and bob montgomery and recorded by holly as a demo , reportedly intended for the everly brothers , though never recorded by that duo ) . this went on to become another national hit for the band . the next single was taken from the sessions where barbata sat in , '' the magic touch . '' while being popular locally , it did not match the success of the previous singles . in addition to the already existing internal problems , the band began to fall apart in july after reese had received a draft notice in the mail ( and arranged to sell his jaguar xke to fuller ) , powell also planned to announce his plans to leave the band to support his family back home . aftermath . bobby fuller died under mysterious circumstances on july 18 , 1966 . his body was found beaten inside his car parked just outside of his hollywood home . evidence suggests that he had ingested gasoline . initially , these details were not released to the public . although many of his friends suspected he might have been murdered by mobsters , fuller 's death was officially ruled a suicide by police . after the death of fuller , the band abruptly disbanded . the group 's final single , '' it 's love , come what may '' was only released in limited quantities as a promotional recording . months later , keane arranged the formation of the randy fuller four in an attempt to capitalize on the previous success of the bobby fuller four , complete with randy fuller on bass and rhythm guitar , dewayne quirico returning on drums , and mike ciccarelli and howard steele ( other former el paso musicians ) on lead guitar and bass , respectively . the group released a few singles ( including overdubbing the bobby fuller four 's '' it 's love , come what may '' ) , but disbanded less than a year later in 1967 without any chart success . most former members of the bobby fuller four remained active in the music industry after the group disbanded . jim reese died in 1991 after suffering a fatal heart attack whilst playing a round of golf . discography . singles . a tracks from the first mustang album also featured on the follow-up album '' i fought the law '' 1 singles released as by bobby fuller 2 released as by bobby fuller and the fanatics 3 released as by the shindigs 4 released as by randy fuller , but actually recorded by the bobby fuller four with randy 's vocals overdubbed on a-side . original us albums . krla king of the wheels ( mustang m-900 mono / ms-900 stereo , 1965 ) i fought the law ( mustang m-901 mono / ms-901 stereo , 1966 ) celebrity night at pj 's ( cancelled â€” originally to be released as mustang m-902 mono / ms-902 stereo ; finally issued in the never to be forgotten : the mustang years box set ) . compilations and reissues . the bobby fuller memorial album ( lp , president 1003 , 1968 ) the best of the bobby fuller four ( lp , rhino rndf-201 , 1981 ) krla king of the wheels ( lp , line lp-5146 , 1981 ) i fought the law ( lp , line lp-5133 , 1981 ) the bobby fuller memorial album ( lp , strand 6.24885 , 1982 ) let them dance ( the rare sides ) ( lp , outline ollp-5272 , 1983 ) live on stage ( lp , outline ollp-5302 , 1983 ) i fought the law ( lp , eva 12032 , 1983 ) live again ( lp , eva 12046 , 1984 ) the best of the bobby fuller four ( cd , rhino 70174 , 1990 ) the bobby fuller four ( cd , ace cdchd-956 , 1990 ) live at pj's.plus !
