Wardell Gray

biography . early years . wardell gray was born in oklahoma city , the youngest of four children . his early childhood years were spent in oklahoma , before moving with his family to detroit joop visser , '' dexter gordon : settin ' the pace '' , proper records , p23 in 1929 . in early 1935 , gray began attending northeastern high school , and then transferred to cass technical high school , which is noted for having donald byrd , lucky thompson and al mckibbon as alumni . he left in 1936 , before graduating . advised by his brother-in-law junior warren , as a teenager he started on the clarinet , but after hearing lester young on record with count basie , he was inspired to switch to the tenor saxophone . gray 's first musical job was in isaac goodwin 's small band , a part-time outfit that played local dances . when auditioning for another job , he was heard by dorothy patton , a young pianist who was forming a band in the fraternal club in flint , michigan , and she hired him . after a very happy year there , he moved to jimmy raschel 's band ( raschel had recorded a few sides earlier in the 1930s but did not do so again ) and then on to the benny carew band in grand rapids , michigan . it was at around this time that he met jeanne goings ; together they had a daughter , anita , who was born in january 1941 . with the earl hines orchestra . just up the road from the congo club was the three sixes ; owens , keith a .

( several unedited versions of these performances have since been issued . ) a 1947 concert at the elks ballroom in los angeles featured both wardell and dexter gordon , and included an 18-minute performance released on 8 78 rpm records as '' the hunt '' ; the entire concert has been released as a 3-cd set ( 21 ) . benny goodman and count basie . apart from a spell with a small band led by al killian ( some jubilee recordings by this group ( 8 ) show wardell in fine form ) wardell was still working mainly in one-off sessions during 1947 . however , at a concert around the turn of that year which also featured benny goodman , wardell so impressed the clarinettist that goodman hired him for a small group which he was just setting up as part of his flirtation with bebop . goodman had previously been highly critical of bop playing but , speaking of wardell to metronome magazine , he said that '' if he 's bop , that 's great . he 's wonderful ! '' goodman 's new group included the young sweden clarinettist stan hasselgard and , initially , teddy wilson , and it opened at frank palumbo 's palumbos in philadelphia in may 1948 . enthusiasts recorded the nightly broadcasts from the club , some of the best of which have been released on cd ( 9 ) , and they contain some superbly relaxed , fluent tenor work from wardell . there is little sign of bop in the group 's playing , the only noticeable influence being in some of wardell 's phrasing and in aspects of mary lou williams ' arrangements for the band . the group was not , however , a financial success and goodman eventually broke it up , but by now wardell was fully established on the east coast as an up-and-coming musician . for a while in late 1948/early 1949 he worked with the count basie orchestra , while also managing to record with tadd dameron ( 10 ) and , in excellent quartet and quintet sessions , with al haig ( 11 , 12 ) . the quartet session included '' twisted '' , one of wardell 's best-known recordings which was used as the basis for a best-selling vocalese version by annie ross . wardell left basie in 1949 to return to benny goodman . however , life in the goodman band became increasingly uncongenial for him . in addition , his marriage to jeri was breaking up . goodman was not an easy employer at the best of times and this , combined with the constant travelling , made wardell increasingly unhappy : recordings of the band , both studio sessions ( 13 ) and live airshots ( 14 , 15 ) , feature work by wardell that is below his own best standards . ( that it is the goodman surroundings that was the problem , rather than any fall-off in wardell 's ability , is shown in a session recorded with local musicians in detroit ( 11 , 18 ) ; wardell 's work on this session is exemplary ) . on leaving goodman , wardell rejoined count basie . basie had bowed to economic pressures and broken up his big band , forming a septet which included clark terry and buddy defranco ; wardell joined them in , probably , july 1950 . this setting was a much happier one for him and the group enjoyed some success ; airshots from the time show a very relaxed , swinging band with no weak links ( 16 ) . it was during this good time from a musical point of view , that wardell 's personal life also became happier . he was finally divorced from jeri and was at last free to marry dorothy and , together with dorothy 's daughter , paula , they set up in a little house in los angeles . the only drawback to working with basie ( who had by now enlarged his group again to big band size ) was the constant travelling , and wardell eventually decided to leave so that he could enjoy more home life . the decision was entirely understandable , though the basie rhythm section was ideally suited to wardell 's brand of swing and , from a musical point of view , enthusiasts for his playing may regret his decision . and an unexpected side-effect was that , because work in the la area was short ( for black musicians , anyway ) wardell still had to travel frequently in search of jobs . nevertheless , life at home was good , and one of the few interviews that he ever gave ( to the british melody maker ) showed that he was very happy . in 1950 , gray played a live concert at the san francisco veteran 's memorial hall as a guest with gerald wilson 's band . remarkably captured in high fidelity stereo ( the only such example in his discography ) , this recording was released for the first time in 2006 ( 17 ) . gray can be heard in fine form during featured solo spots with small combo backup on '' nice work if you can get it '' and '' indiana '' and also with wilson 's big band on the blues '' hollywood freeway '' where gray trades exciting choruses with zoot sims and stan getz . the decline . at around this time his recording sessions started becoming fewer & mdash ; though a live session with dexter gordon , recreating the excitements of central avenue , and a studio session with art farmer and hampton hawes ( both on 18 ) , have fine examples of wardell 's playing . however , there are increasing signs of a lack of engagement in wardell 's work around 1951/52 , notably in a further live session with dexter gordon from february 1952 ( 5 ) , and it seems that he may have been becoming disillusioned with the music business . that he was still capable of playing superbly is shown by his work on a live jam session at the haig ( 19 ) , but such sessions were by now very sparse , and more typical work from this period was recorded on a session with teddy charles ( 17 ) . at around this time , gray apparently became involved with drugs ; friends reported that this was taking its toll . his playing was now less fluent , and a studio session in january 1955 ( 12 ) , which was to be his last , shows strong but ( by his own standards ) rather unsubtle playing . disappearance and death . gray was still working regularly despite his drug problems , and when benny carter was engaged in may 1955 to provide the band at the opening of the moulin rouge hotel , he called on gray . gray attended rehearsals but was absent when the club opened on may 25 . the next day he was found on a stretch of desert on the outskirts of las vegas dead with a broken neck . although there was a poor examination of circumstances , by most accounts , gray 's demise was ruled an accidental death . foul play was suspected by some , especially given gray 's possible association with mob boss meyer lansky . in popular culture . james ellroy 's novel the cold six thousand contains a reference to gray 's disappearance and death : james ellroy , the cold six thousand , windmill books , 2010 , pp . & nbsp ; 271 , 284 and 372 . according to this , he was murdered by ( fictional ) racist conspirator wayne tedrow , sr . for having an affair with his wife , janice . bill moody 's book death of a tenor man tells the story of a contemporary investigation of wardell 's death by fictional detective/pianist evan horne . bill moody , death of a tenor man , dark city books , 2003 . jack kerouac explicitly references wardell in his novel on the road : '' they ate voraciously as neal , sandwich in hand , stood bowed and jumping before the big phonograph listening to a wild bop record i just bought called 'the hunt ' , with dexter gordon and wardell gray blowing their tops before a screaming audience that gave the record fantastic frenzied volume .
