Usagi Yojimbo

publishing history . sakai originally planned for usagi and other characters to be human in stories explicitly modeled after the life of miyamoto musashi . however , once as sakai was idly doodling , he drew rabbit ears tied in a topknot on his proposed hero and was pleased by the distinctive image . usagi yojimbo dojo – faq : questions about usagi yojimbo . usagiyojimbo.com ( 2004-02-29 ) . retrieved on 2011-05-29 . usagi was first conceived as a supporting character in the adventures of nilson groundthumper and hermy , a brief series that predates usagi yojimbo . usagi yojimbo dojo – faq : questions about nilson groundthumper and hermy . usagiyojimbo.com ( 2004-02-29 ) . retrieved on 2011-05-29 . sakai expanded on the idea of a rabbit samurai and his world took on an anthropomorphized cartoon nature , creating a fantasy setting which suited his dramatic needs with a unique look he thought could attract readers . usagi first appeared in the anthology albedo anthropomorphics in 1984 , and later in the fantagraphics books anthropomorphic anthology critters , before appearing in his own series in 1987 . the usagi yojimbo series has been published by four different companies . the first publisher was fantagraphics ( volume one ; 38 regular issues , plus one summer special and three color specials ) . the second was mirage comics ( volume two ; 16 issues ) . the third was dark horse comics ( volume three , 172 regular issues and two color specials ) , which also published the senso miniseries ( 2015 ) , the art of usagi yojimbo : 20th anniversary edition ( 2004 ) , and usagi yojimbo : 35 years of covers ( 2018 ) , as well as republishing the fantagraphics and mirage series . the fourth is idw publishing , by which usagi yojimbo is still being published ( volume four , more than 12 issues ) , and which is also republishing the usagi yojimbo portions of the fantagraphics series as usagi yojimbo color classics . another publisher , radio comix , published two issues of the art of usagi yojimbo ( 1997–1998 ) which contained a selection of unpublished drawings , convention sketches , and other miscellaneous usagi yojimbo artwork ( including an original short story in the first issue ) . because usagi yojimbo is a creator-owned comic and sakai has complete and sole ownership of the character , miyamoto usagi has been able to appear in occasional short stories published by companies other than the one currently publishing his series . usagi has appeared in stories published by cartoon books , oni press , sky dog press , wizard press , and most recently in the benefit book drawing the line , the proceeds of which went to princess margaret hospital and the hospital for sick children , both in toronto , for cancer research . sakai has experimented with formats for usagi yojimbo , such as when he published the color story '' green persimmon '' first as twelve separate 2-page chapters serialized in diamond comic distributor 's monthly catalog previews . he has also serialized two short stories in a comic strip format in the tabloid-size promotional publication dark horse extra . usagi yojimbo stories have also been created as both single-page '' gag '' stories and as multi-issue epic adventures . usagi has also appeared several times in teenage mutant ninja turtles ( the comic , all three of the animated series , and their respective toy lines ) , and the turtles have appeared in usagi yojimbo as well . in the 1987 series , '' usagi yojimbo '' is incorrectly used as his actual name , but in the 2003 series , where he appeared far more frequently , he was referred to correctly as miyamoto usagi . he was even joined by gen and other characters from his stories in his guest appearances in the 2003 series . usagi 's first appearance in the 2012 series was the fifth-season episode , '' yojimbo '' , which was written by sakai . in his guest appearances , he is closest to leonardo , both sharing the same ideals and code of ethics . the comics version also makes several pun references to sergio aragonés ' groo the wanderer , in whose publication sakai was also involved . in addition , sakai created a limited spin off series called space usagi featuring characters similar to those in the original series , including a descendant of miyamoto usagi , but set in a futuristic setting that also emulated feudal japan in political and stylistic ways . three mini-series of three issues each and two short stories featuring the characters were produced . sakai has tentative plans to produce a fourth space usagi miniseries , but nothing has been announced yet . coming up in usagi yojimbo . usagiyojimbo.com ( 2006-02-20 ) . retrieved on 2011-05-29 . in the summer of 2014 , sakai , after a two-year hiatus , returned with a six-issue mini-series entitled usagi yojimbo : senso . senso , japanese for '' war '' , refers to the war of the worlds , h . g . wells 's novel about martians invading earth . senso tells the story of martians invading japan roughly twenty years after the events of the main series of usagi yojimbo , and also forms a plot bridge to the previously published space usagi . in may 2015 , sakai returned to usagi yojimbo with the release of the 145th issue . on february 22 2019 , the new york times reported that idw publishing will present a new monthly usagi yojimbo series , in color ( provided by tom luth for the first time ) . the new series will open with a short story arc about the japanese puppetry art of bunraku . additionally , new full-color collections of earlier issues are planned . . appearances on television . usagi first appeared in episodes 32 and 34 in the third season of the 1987 teenage mutant ninja turtles animated series . he next appeared in episodes 23–26 in the second season of the 2003 teenage mutant ninja turtles animated series for an interdimensional tournament against the turtles ( along with gen ) . he and gen showed up again in episodes 1 and 22–23 of season 3 for a christmas party and a continuation of the second-season storyline ( which prominently featured his world and characters ) , respectively . usagi again appeared in episode 13 of season 4 ( '' samurai tourist '' ) for a confrontation with leonardo , although the focus was mainly on gen . usagi and gen also attended the wedding of april o'neil and casey jones in episode 13 of season 7 ( back to the sewer ) titled '' wedding bells and bytes '' . he becomes one of their greatest inter-dimensional allies and especially closest to leonardo . in september 2016 , an appearance of usagi was also announced for the 2012 cgi series of teenage mutant ninja turtles . justin w . : stan sakai confirms usagi yojimbo will be in

movies . usagi 's former lord is named mifune , which is a nod to toshiro mifune , an actor who starred in countless classic samurai films . gen , the rhino bounty hunter , was inspired by the

goat and kid '' features an assassin who wanders with his son in a babycart , referring to the film/manga series , lone wolf and cub . most significantly , the main character 's name , miyamoto usagi

way that usagi collects various allies to raid an evil lord 's fortress . while usagi yojimbo draws most heavily upon samurai and chanbara films , it has also been influenced by japanese films from other genres . for example , the three-part story '' sumi-e '' ( included in vol . 18 . travels with jotaro ) features monsters resembling godzilla ( identified as '' zylla '' , who was first introduced in vol . 2 . samurai ) , gamera , ghidorah , mothra , and daimajin .
