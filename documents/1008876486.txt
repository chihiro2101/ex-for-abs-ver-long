Video nasty

obscenity and video . at the time of the introduction of domestic video recorders in the united kingdom during the 1970s , there was no legislation specifically designed to regulate video content , apart from the obscene publications act 1959 which had been amended in 1977 to cover erotic films . major film distributors were initially reluctant to embrace the new medium of video for fear of piracy and the video market became flooded with low-budget horror films . whilst some of these films had been passed by the british board of film censors ( bbfc ) for cinema release , others had been refused certification which effectively banned them . the obscene publications act defined obscenity as that which may '' tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely , having regard to all relevant circumstances , to read , see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it '' . this definition is of course open to wide interpretation . if the director of public prosecutions ( dpp ) felt that a certain video might be in breach of the act , then a prosecution could be brought against the film 's producers , distributors and retailers . prosecutions had to be fought on a case-by-case basis and a backlog of prosecutions built up . however , under the terms of the act the police were empowered to seize videos from retailers if they were of the opinion that the material was in breach of the act . in the early 1980s , in certain police constabularies , notably greater manchester police which was at that time run by devout christian chief constable james anderton , police raids on video hire shops increased . however the choice of titles seized appeared to be completely arbitrary , one raid famously netting a copy of the dolly parton musical the best little whorehouse in texas ( 1982 ) under the mistaken belief it was pornographic . the video retailers association were alarmed by the apparently random seizures and asked the dpp to provide a guideline for the industry so that stockists could be made aware of the titles which were liable to be confiscated . the dpp recognised that the current system , where the interpretation of obscenity was down to individual chief constables , was inconsistent and decided to publish a list that contained names of films that had already resulted in a successful prosecution or where the dpp had already filed charges against the video 's distributors . this list became known as the dpp list of '' video nasties '' . the lack of regulation of the domestic video market was in sharp contrast to the regulation of material intended for public screenings . the bbfc had been established in 1912 , essentially as an unintended consequence of the cinematograph act 1909 , and it was their responsibility to pass films intended for the cinema for certification within the united kingdom ( though local councils were the final arbiters ) . as part of this process the board could recommend , or demand in the more extreme cases , that certain cuts be made to the film in order for it to gain a particular certification . such permission was not always granted , and in the case of the release of the exorcist in 1973 , a number of enterprising managers of cinemas where permission had been granted set about providing buses to transport cinema-goers from other localities where the film could not be seen . public concern . public awareness of the availability of these videos began in early 1982 , when vipco ( video instant picture company ) , the uk distributors of the driller killer , a 1979 splatter film , took out full-page advertisements in a number of specialist video magazines , depicting the video 's explicit cover ; an action which resulted in a large number of complaints to the advertising standards agency . nick johnstone ( 1999 ) . abel ferrara : the king of new york . omnibus press : 13 a few months later go video , the distributors of the already-controversial 1980 italian film cannibal holocaust , in an effort to boost publicity and generate sales that ultimately backfired , wrote anonymously to mary whitehouse of the mediawatch-uk complaining about their own film . whitehouse sparked off a public campaign and coined the term '' video nasty '' . amid the growing concern , the sunday times brought the issue to a wider audience in may 1982 with an article entitled '' how high street horror is invading the home '' . soon the daily mail began their own campaign against the distribution of these films . the exposure of '' nasties '' to children began to be blamed for the increase in violent crime amongst youths . the growing media frenzy only served to increase the demand for such material among adolescents . at the suggestion of the national viewers ' and listeners ' association , the conservative mp graham bright introduced a private member 's bill to the house of commons in 1983 . this was passed as the video recordings act 1984 which came into effect on 1 september 1985 . effects of the video recordings act 1984 . under the 1984 act , the british board of film censors was renamed the british board of film classification and became responsible for the certification of both cinema and video releases . all video releases after 1 september 1985 had to comply with the act and be submitted for classification by the bbfc . films released on video before that date had to be re-submitted for classification within the following three years . the increased possibility of videos falling into the hands of children required that film classification for video be a separate process from cinema classification . films that had passed uncut for cinema release were often cut for video . the supply of unclassified videos became a criminal offence , as did supplying 15 and 18 certificate videos to under-aged people . as well as the low-budget horror films the act was originally intended to curb , a number of high-profile films which had passed cinema certification fell foul of the act . in particular , the exorcist , which was made available by warner home video in december 1981 , was not submitted for video certification by the bbfc and was withdrawn from shelves in 1986 . similarly straw dogs was denied video certification and removed from video stores . popular culture backlash against the video recordings act included the may 1984 release of '' nasty '' by the punk-goth outfit the damned , who celebrated the condemned genre with the lyrics '' i fell in love with a video nasty '' . the tv show the young ones included an entire episode entitled '' nasty '' , in which the characters rent a video recorder specifically to watch a '' video nasty '' ( with the fictitious name sex with the headless corpse of the virgin astronaut ) , and which featured a lip synched performance of '' nasty '' by the damned . in another episode , '' bambi '' , the eponymous character had apparently done a '' disney nasty '' entitled bambi goes crazy-ape bonkers with his drill and sex . the television programme spitting image parodied the video nasties with their sketch of a sickeningly nice , low-budget film entitled a video '' nicie '' . neil innes ' song '' my new school '' ( 1984 ) contains a video nasty reference '' it 's got all the charm of a video nasty/i 've never been anywhere so ghastly , my new school '' . the wildhearts ’ song “ splattermania ” lampoons the moral panic , namechecking films and directors associated therewith , and declaring that “ it isn ’ t real , the nation ain ’ t in danger/it ’ s only splattermania ” . relaxation of censorship . with the passing of the video recordings act , the films on the list could be prosecuted for both obscenity and not being classified . as well as not passing any film liable to be found obscene , the bbfc imposed additional bans and cuts on films such as the texas chain saw massacre . claims , since proven at best to be speculative , at worst outright media fabrication , relating to the hungerford massacre and the murder of james bulger ( where the 1991 film child 's play 3 was erroneously held up as influencing the perpetrators , possibly prompting the 1992 film mikey to be prohibited in the uk ) , provided an additional impetus to restrict films and as late as december 1997 , the board claimed it '' has never relaxed its guidelines on video violence , which remain the strictest in the world '' . however , the board did loosen its standards , especially at the 18 level , in response to public consultation in 2000 . the departure of james ferman from the bbfc may also have allowed some long-proscribed films to be re-appraised around this time . the exorcist was granted an uncut 18 video certificate on 25 february 1999 , followed by the texas chain saw massacre in august , and several official '' nasties '' were passed in the early 2000s either uncut or with cuts restricted to sexual violence or actual animals being harmed . a list of these is given below . among modern films , many , such as the hostel and saw series , contain brutal , graphic violence but have passed through uncut . in 2008 , there was another brief media frenzy over such films that had years earlier been approved for release by the bbfc , in particular ss experiment camp . stop this debasing film -times online this coincided with an attempt by mps julian brazier and keith vaz to pass a law allowing mps greater powers to tighten bbfc guidelines or force an appeal of a release . mps press for ban on ss camp ‘ video nasty ’ the bill failed to pass . however , the uk government passed a law criminalising possession of '' extreme pornography '' . whilst bbfc-rated films are exempt from the legislation , screenshots from these same bbfc-rated movies are not , and would also apply to unrated films . hostel : part ii was cited in the house of commons as an example of a film where screenshots could become illegal to possess . . dpp list . the dpp list of '' video nasties '' was first made public in june 1983 . the list was modified monthly as prosecutions failed or were dropped . in total , 72 separate films appeared on the list at one time or another . 39 films were successfully prosecuted under the obscene publications act but some of these films have been subsequently cut and then approved for release by the bbfc . the remaining 33 were either not prosecuted or had unsuccessful prosecutions . 10 films remain banned in the uk because they have not yet been resubmitted for classification by any distributors or have been rejected for classification . a number of films spent a short time on this list because their prosecutions failed shortly after publication or because it was decided that prosecution was not worth pursuing . ultimately , the list became obsolete when the video recordings act came into force , and since 2001 , several of the films have been released uncut . in the majority of cases below where cuts were made , they were scenes of real-life animal cruelty and/or excessive violence to women , both of which are still regarded with some degree of severity by the bbfc . a large number of these movies caused additional controversy with the cover art of the original big box releases seen in the video shops of the early 1980s . unless noted otherwise , all films that have been released have been rated 18 . the dpp list is divided into two sections : section 2 and section 3 . any title seized under section 2 would make the dealer or distributor liable to prosecution for disseminating obscene materials . dealers could be fined or jailed and the film itself would be declared obscene if the prosecution was successful , meaning it could not be distributed or sold in the uk until the obscenity was quashed . 39 of the section 2 films were successfully prosecuted and remained banned . 33 of the section 2 films had unsuccessful prosecutions and were subsequently dropped from the list and placed onto section 3 . section 3 titles were liable to be confiscated under a '' less obscene '' charge , which allowed the police to seize a film they considered obscene and as long as the dealer cooperated , they legally admit that the articles are obscene and therefore escape any personal prosecution . the 33 films that could n't be prosecuted under section 2 automatically became section 3 titles and were still seized by the police . the main difference between section 2 and 3 is that video dealers or distributors could be personally prosecuted in court for holding the film under section 2 but not under section 3 , where the obscenity is admitted through forfeiting the material . section 1 : prosecuted films . absurd ( original title : rosso sangue , also known as
