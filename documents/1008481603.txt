STMicroelectronics

history . st was formed in 1987 by the merger of two government-owned semiconductor companies : italian '' sgs microelettronic '' ( where sgs stands for '' società generale semiconduttori '' , '' semiconductors ' general company '' ) , and french '' thomson semiconducteurs '' , the semiconductor arm of thomson : '' sgs microelettronica '' originated in 1972 from a previous merger of two companies : ates ( '' aquila tubi e semiconduttori '' ) , a vacuum tube and semiconductor maker headquartered in l'aquila , the regional capital of abruzzo , which in 1961 changed its name to azienda tecnica ed elettronica del sud and relocated its manufacturing plant in the industrial zone of catania , in sicily ; '' società generale semiconduttori '' ( founded in 1957 by adriano olivetti ) . '' thomson semiconducteurs '' was created in 1982 by the french government 's widespread nationalization of industries . it included : the semiconductor activities of the french electronics company thomson ; in 1985 it bought mostek , a us company founded in 1969 as a spin-off of texas instruments , from united technologies ; silec , founded in 1977 ; eurotechnique , founded in 1979 in rousset , bouches-du-rhône as a joint-venture between saint-gobain of france and us-based national semiconductor ; efcis , founded in 1977 ; sescosem , founded in 1969 . at the time of the merger of these two companies in 1987 , the newborn corporation was named '' sgs-thomson '' but took its current name in may 1998 following thomson ’ s sale of its shares . after its creation st was ranked 14th among the top 20 semiconductor suppliers with sales of around us 850 million . the company has participated in the consolidation of the semiconductor industry since its formation , with acquisitions including : in 1989 , british company inmos known for its transputer microprocessors from parent thorn emi ; in 1994 , canada-based nortel 's semiconductor activities ; in 2000 , waferscale integration inc . ( wsi , fremont , california ) , a vendor of eprom and flash memory-based programmable system-chips ; in 2002 , alcatel 's microelectronics division , which along with the incorporation of smaller ventures such as uk company , synad ltd , helped the company expand into the wireless-lan market ; in 2007 , us-based genesis microchip . genesis microchip is known for their strength in video processing technology ( faroudja ) and has design centres located in santa clara , california , toronto , taipei and bangalore . on december 8 , 1994 , the company completed its initial public offering on the paris and new york stock exchanges . owner thomson sa sold its stake in the company in 1998 when the company also listed on the italian bourse in milan . in 2002 , motorola and tsmc joined st and philips in a new technology partnership . the crolles 2 alliance was created with a new 12 '' wafer manufacturing facility located in crolles , france . by 2005 , st was ranked fifth , behind intel , samsung , texas instruments and toshiba , but ahead of infineon , renesas , nec , nxp semiconductors , and freescale . the company was the largest european semiconductors supplier , ahead of infineon and nxp . early in 2007 , '' nxp semiconductors '' ( formerly '' philips semiconductors '' ) and '' freescale '' ( formerly '' motorola semiconductors '' ) decided to stop their participation in crolles 2 alliance . under the terms of the agreement the alliance came to an end on december 31 , 2007 . on may 22 , 2007 , st and intel created a joint venture in the memory application called numonyx : this new company merged st and '' intel flash memory '' activities . semiconductor market consolidation continued with st and nxp announcing on april 10 , 2008 , the creation of a new joint venture of their mobile activities , with st owning 80 % of the new company and nxp 20 % . this joint venture began on august 20 , 2008 . on february 10 , 2009 , st ericsson , a joint venture bringing together '' st-nxp wireless '' and '' ericsson mobile platforms '' , was established . '' st ericsson '' was a multinational manufacturer of wireless products and semiconductors , supplying to mobile device manufacturers . st-ericsson was a 50/50 joint venture of stmicroelectronics and ericsson established on february 3 , 2009 , and dissolved on august 2 , 2013 . headquartered in geneva , switzerland , it was a fabless company , outsourcing semiconductor manufacturing to foundry companies . in 2011 , st announced the creation of a joint lab with sant'anna school of advanced studies . the lab will focus on research and innovation in bio-robotics , smart systems and microelectronics . past collaborations with sant'anna school of advanced studies included dustbot , a platform that integrated self-navigating '' service robots '' for waste collection . . shareholders . as of december 31 , 2014 , the shareholders were : 68.4 % public ( new york stock exchange , euronext paris , borsa italiana ) 4.1 % treasury shares 27.6 % stmicroelectronics holding
