'' as early as 1832 , mormon missionaries worked successfully to convert followers in maine of polygamist religious leader jacob cochran , who went into hiding in 1830 to escape imprisonment due to his practice of polygamy . among cochran 's marital innovations was '' spiritual wifery , '' and '' tradition assumes that he received frequent consignments of spiritual consorts , and that such were invariably the most robust and attractive women in the community .

'' the first quote above is not attested in any mormon source , but first appeared in a derisive article in the new york times on may 15 , 1860 . hirshson 's cited source of the first quote is an april 17 , 1860 new york times article : fairmormon , an lds apologetics organization , considers the '' prettiest women '' statement to be apocryphal , but that it may be a paraphrase of kimball 's journal of discourses statement , which is authentic . in the paragraph immediately following the above quote , kimball said : the precise number who participated in plural marriage is not known , but studies indicate a maximum of 20 to 25 percent of latter-day saint adults were members of polygamist households . one third of the women of marriageable age and nearly all of the church leadership were involved in the practice . encyclopedia of mormonism . macmillan ( 1992 ) p . 1095 . . instances of coercion . critics of polygamy in the early lds church have documented several cases where deception and coercion were used to induce marriage , for example citing the case of joseph smith who warned some potential spouses of eternal damnation if they did not consent to be his wife . in 1893 , married lds church member john d . miles traveled to england and proposed to caroline owens , assuring her that he was not polygamous . she returned to utah and participated in a wedding , only to find out after the ceremony that miles was already married . she ran away , but miles hunted her down and raped her . she eventually escaped , and filed a lawsuit against miles that reached the supreme court and became a significant case in polygamy case law . ann eliza young , nineteenth wife of brigham young , claimed that young coerced her to marry him by threatening financial ruin of her brother . . incestuous plural marriages . critics of polygamy in the early lds church claim that polygamy was used to justify marriage of close relatives that would otherwise be considered immoral . in 1843 , joseph smith 's diary records the sealing of john milton bernhisel to his sister , maria , in a ceremony that included the sealing of bernhisel to multiple relatives , some of whom were deceased . however , this is understood by most scholars as the collective sealing or binding of the family and not a marriage between bernhisel and his sister . similar family sealings are practiced in latter-day saint temples today , where children of parents who were not sealed at the time of their marriage are sealed to their parents and to one another in a group ceremony . see also . criticism of the latter day saint movement the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints and politics in the united states marriage in the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints short creek raid sister wives . notes . references . . further reading . books . talbot , christine . a foreign kingdom : mormons and polygamy in american political culture , 1852-1890 . urbana , il : university of illinois press , 2013 . . journal articles . . other . & nbsp ; – provides a historical overview & nbsp ; – about the beginnings of plural marriage in the church & nbsp ; – about plural marriage in utah & nbsp ; – about the gradual ending of plural marriage . external links .
