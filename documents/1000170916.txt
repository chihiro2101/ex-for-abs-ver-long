Welsh Language Society

history and background . the society was established in name on 4 august 1962 at pontarddulais in south wales , but did not have a constitution until 18 may 1963 . the formation was at least partly inspired by the annual bbc wales radio lecture given on 13 february 1962 by saunders lewis and entitled tynged yr iaith ( the fate of the language ) . davies , a history of wales , penguin , 1994 , , p 649 : '' the catalyst ( for its formation ) was the radio lecture given by saunders lewis on 13/2/62 '' the society 's first public protest took place in february 1963 in aberystwyth town centre where members pasted posters on the post office in an attempt to be arrested and go to trial . when it became apparent that they would not be arrested for the posters , they then moved to pont trefechan in aberystwyth , where around seventy members and supporters held a 'sit-in ' blocking road traffic for half an hour . dylan philps .
