Pentium II

overview . the pentium ii microprocessor was largely based upon the microarchitecture of its predecessor , the pentium pro , but with some significant improvements . unlike previous pentium and pentium pro processors , the pentium ii cpu was packaged in a slot-based module rather than a cpu socket . the processor and associated components were carried on a daughterboard similar to a typical expansion board within a plastic cartridge . a fixed or removable heatsink was carried on one side , sometimes using its own fan . pabst , thomas . intel 's slot 1 cpus uncovered , tom 's hardware , may 3 , 1998 . this larger package was a compromise allowing intel to separate the secondary cache from the processor while still keeping it on a closely coupled back-side bus . the l2 cache ran at half the processor 's clock frequency , unlike the pentium pro , whose off die l2 cache ran at the same frequency as the processor . however , its associativity was increased to 16-way ( compared to 4-way on the pentium pro ) and its size was always 512 & nbsp ; kb , twice of the smallest option of 256 & nbsp ; kb on the pentium pro . off-package cache solved the pentium pro 's low yield issues , allowing intel to introduce the pentium ii at a mainstream price level . pabst , thomas . the intel pentium ii ( 'klamath ' ) cpu , tom 's hardware , march 1 , 1997 . lal shimpi , anand . intel pentium ii , anandtech , may 30 , 1997 . intel improved 16-bit code execution performance on the pentium ii , an area in which the pentium pro was at a notable handicap , by adding segment register caches . most consumer software of the day was still using at least some 16-bit code , because of a variety of factors . the issues with partial registers was also addressed by adding an internal flag to skip pipeline flushes whenever possible . to compensate for the slower l2 cache , the pentium ii featured 32 & nbsp ; kb of l1 cache , double that of the pentium pro , as well as 4 write buffers ( vs . 2 on the pentium pro ) ; these can also be used by either pipeline , instead of each one being fixed to one pipeline . pc guide , accessed july 16 , 2016 . the pentium ii was also the first p6-based cpu to implement the intel mmx integer simd instruction set which had already been introduced on the pentium mmx . the pentium ii was basically a more consumer-oriented version of the pentium pro . it was cheaper to manufacture because of the separate , slower l2 cache memory . the improved 16-bit performance and mmx support made it a better choice for consumer-level operating systems , such as windows 9x , and multimedia applications . the slower and cheaper l2 cache 's performance penalty was mitigated by the doubled l1 cache and architectural improvements for legacy code . general processor performance was increased while costs were cut . pabst , thomas . the empire strikes back : intel 's pentium ii cpu , tom 's hardware , april 30 , 1997 . all klamath and some early deschutes pentium iis use a combined l2 cache controller / tag ram chip that only allows for 512 & nbsp ; mb to be cached ; while more ram could be installed in theory , this would result in very slow performance . while this limit was practically irrelevant for the average home user at the time , it was a concern for some workstation or server users . presumably , intel put this limitation deliberately in place to distinguish the pentium ii from the more upmarket pentium pro line , which has a full 4 & nbsp ; gb cacheable area . the '82459ad ' revision of the chip on some 333 & nbsp ; mhz and all 350 & nbsp ; mhz and faster pentium iis lifted this restriction and also offered a full 4 gb cacheable area . tom 's hardware , accessed july 16 , 2016 . pc guide , accessed july 16 , 2016 . . variants . klamath . the original klamath pentium ii microprocessor ( intel product code 80522 ) ran at 233 , 266 , and 300 & nbsp ; mhz and was produced in a 0.35 μm process . ia-32 implementation intel p2 ( incl . celeron and xeon ) , sandpile.org , accessed may 5 , 2007 . the 300 & nbsp ; mhz version , however , only became available in quantities later in 1997 . these cpus had a 66 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus and were initially used on motherboards equipped with the aging intel 440fx natoma chipset designed for the pentium pro . intel 440fx , pcguide , accessed may 5 , 2007 . pentium ii-based systems using the intel 440lx balboa chipset widely popularized sdram ( which was to replace edo ram and was already introduced with 430vx ) , and the agp graphics bus . intel 440lx , pcguide , accessed may 5 , 2007 . on july 14 , 1997 , intel announced a version of the pentium ii klamath with 2× 72-bit ecc l2 cache for entry-level servers , as opposed to the 2× 64-bit non-ecc l2 cache on regular models . intel , accessed february 4 , 2017 . the extra bits give it error-correction capability built into hardware , without impacting performance . the variant can be determined through the cpu part number . in intel 's '' family/model/stepping '' scheme , klamath cpus are family 6 , model 3 . deschutes . the deschutes core pentium ii ( 80523 ) , which debuted at 333 & nbsp ; mhz in january 1998 , was produced with a 0.25 μm process and has a significantly lower power draw . the die size is 113 & nbsp ; mm 2 . the 333 & nbsp ; mhz variant was the final pentium cpu that used the older 66 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus ; all subsequent deschutes-core models used a 100 & nbsp ; mhz fsb . later in 1998 , pentium iis running at 266 , 300 , 350 , 400 , and 450 & nbsp ; mhz were also released . the deschutes core introduced fxsave and fxrstor instructions for fast fpu context save and restore . towards the end of its design life , deschutes chips capable of 500 & nbsp ; mhz within intel cooling and design specifications were produced . however , these were not marketed . rather than destroy already multiplier-locked units , those deschutes units that had been tested and locked with a multiplier of 5 were sold as being 333 & nbsp ; mhz . this was accomplished by disabling the 100 & nbsp ; mhz bus option . overclockers , upon learning of this , purchased the units in question and ran them well over 500 & nbsp ; mhz ; most notably , when overclocking , the final batch of '' 333 mhz '' cpus were capable of speeds much higher than cpus sold at 350 , 400 , or 450 & nbsp ; mhz . concurrent with the release of deschutes cores supporting a 100 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus was intel 's release of the 440bx seattle chipset and its derivatives , the 440mx , 450nx , and 440zx chipsets . replacing the aged 66 & nbsp ; mhz fsb , which had been on the market since 1993 , the 100 & nbsp ; mhz fsb resulted in solid performance improvements for the pentium ii lineup . pentium ii chips starting with 350 & nbsp ; mhz were released in both secc and secc2 form factors . late pentium iis also marked the switch to flip-chip based packaging with direct heatsink contact to the die , as opposed to traditional bonding . while klamath features 4 cache chips and simulates dual-porting through interleaving ( 2x 64-bit ) for a slight performance improvement on concurrent accesses , deschutes only sports 2 cache chips and offers slightly lower l2 cache performance at the same clockspeed . furthermore , deschutes always features ecc-enabled l2 cache . the pentium ii xeon was a high-end version of deschutes core intended for use on workstations and servers . principally , it used a different type of slot ( slot 2 ) , case , board design , and more expensive full-speed custom l2 cache , which was off-die . versions were produced with 512 & nbsp ; kb , 1 & nbsp ; mb or 2 & nbsp ; mb l2 caches by varying the number of 512 & nbsp ; kb chips incorporated on the board . pabst , thomas . intel 's pentium ii xeon processor , tom 's hardware , july 2 , 1998 . in intel 's '' family/model/stepping '' scheme , deschutes cpus are family 6 , model 5 and have the part number 80523 . pentium ii overdrive . in 1998 , the 0.25 μm deschutes core was utilized in the creation of the pentium ii overdrive processor , which was aimed at allowing corporate pentium pro users to upgrade their aging servers . combining the deschutes core in a flip-chip package with a 512 & nbsp ; kb full-speed l2 cache chip from the pentium ii xeon into a socket 8-compatible module resulted in a 300 or 333 & nbsp ; mhz processor that could run on a 60 or 66 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus . this combination brought together some of the more attractive aspects of the pentium ii and the pentium ii xeon : mmx support/improved 16-bit performance and full-speed l2 cache , respectively . wayback machine archive of heise , accessed june 17 , 2009 the later '' dixon '' mobile pentium ii would emulate this combination with 256 & nbsp ; kb of full-speed cache . in intel 's '' family/model/stepping '' scheme , the pentium ii overdrive cpu identifies itself as family 6 , model 3 , though this is misleading , as it is not based on the family 6/model 3 klamath core . as noted in the pentium ii processor update documentation from intel , '' please note that although this processor has a cpuid of 163xh , it uses a pentium ii processor cpuid 065xh processor core . '' specification update for the pentium ii processor . tonga . the 0.25 & nbsp ; μm tonga core was the first mobile pentium ii and had all of the features of the desktop models . in intel 's '' family/model/stepping '' scheme , tonga cpus are family 6 , model 5 . dixon . later , in 1999 , the 0.25 ; 0.18 ( 400 & nbsp ; mhz ) μm dixon core with 256 & nbsp ; kb of on-die full speed cache was produced for the mobile market . reviews showed that the dixon core was the fastest type of pentium ii produced . in intel 's '' family/model/stepping '' scheme , dixon cpus are family 6 , model 6 and their intel product code is 80524 . these identifiers are shared with the mendocino celeron processors . core specifications . desktop . . klamath ( 80522 ) . l1 cache : 16 + 16 & nbsp ; kb ( data + instructions ) l2 cache : 512 & nbsp ; kb , as external chips on the cpu module clocked at half the cpu frequency . packaging : slot 1 module mmx front-side bus : 66 & nbsp ; mhz , gtl+ vcore : 2.8 & nbsp ; v process : 0.35 & nbsp ; μm cmos first release : may 7 , 1997 clockrate : 233 , 266 , 300 & nbsp ; mhz . deschutes ( 80523 ) . l1 cache : 16 + 16 & nbsp ; kb ( data + instructions ) l2 cache : 512 & nbsp ; kb , as external chips on the cpu module clocked at half the cpu frequency . packaging : slot 1 module mmx front-side bus : 66 , 100 & nbsp ; mhz , gtl+ vcore : 2.0 & nbsp ; v process : 0.25 & nbsp ; μm cmos first release : january 26 , 1998 clockrate : 266–450 & nbsp ; mhz 66 & nbsp ; mhz fsb : 266 , 300 , 333 & nbsp ; mhz 100 & nbsp ; mhz fsb : 350 , 400 , 450 & nbsp ; mhz . deschutes ( pentium ii overdrive ) . l1 cache : 16 + 16 & nbsp ; kb ( data + instructions ) l2 cache : 512 & nbsp ; kb external chip on cpu module running at 100 % of cpu speed socket : socket 8 front-side bus : 60 or 66 & nbsp ; mhz , gtl+ vcore : 3.1–3.3 & nbsp ; v ( has on-board voltage regulator ) fabrication : 0.25 & nbsp ; μm based on the deschutes-generation pentium ii first release : 1998 supports mmx technology the sspec number sl2ke denotes a pentium ii overdrive sold with an integrated heatsink/fan combination for socket 8 . note that the sspec number sl2ea denotes a pentium ii overdrive sold with an integrated heatsink but no fan for slot 1 . mobile . . tonga ( 80523 ) . mobile pentium ii l1 cache : 16 + 16 & nbsp ; kb ( data + instructions ) l2 cache : 512 & nbsp ; kb , as external chips on the cpu module clocked at half the cpu frequency . package : mmc-1 , mmc-2 , mini-cartridge mmx front side bus : 66 & nbsp ; mhz , gtl+ vcore : 1.6 & nbsp ; v process : 0.25 & nbsp ; μm cmos first release : april 2 , 1998 clockrate : 233 , 266 , 300 & nbsp ; mhz . dixon ( 80524 ) . mobile pentium ii pe ( '' performance enhanced '' ) l1 cache : 16 + 16 & nbsp ; kb ( data + instructions ) l2 cache : 256 & nbsp ; kb , on-die , full speed . package : bga1 , mmc-1 , mmc-2 , μpga1 ppga-b615 mmx front-side bus : 66 , 100 & nbsp ; mhz , gtl+ vcore : 1.5 , 1.55 , 1.6 , 2.0 & nbsp ; v process : 0.25 ; 0.18 ( 400 mhz ) & nbsp ; μm cmos first release : january 25 , 1999 clockrate : 266 , 300 , 333 , 366 , 400 & nbsp ; mhz containing 27.4 million transistors die size ( semiconductor chip ) is 10.36 & nbsp ; mm x 17.36 & nbsp ; mm 179.8496 & nbsp ; mm 2 . see also . list of intel pentium ii microprocessors intel celeron . references . external links . listing of various pii , piii , and celeron alphanumeric model designations cpu-info : intel pentium ii , indepth processor history construction analysis : intel 266mhz 32-bit pentium ii ( klamath ) processor , integrated circuit engineering corporation intel datasheets pentium ii ( klamath ) pentium ii ( deschutes ) mobile pentium ii ( tonga ) mobile pentium ii in micro-pga and bga packages ( dixon )
