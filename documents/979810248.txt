August Tholuck

biography . tholuck was born at breslau , and educated at the gymnasium and university there . he distinguished himself by his ability to learn languages . a love of oriental languages and literature led him to exchange the university of breslau for that of berlin , in order to study to greater advantage , and there he was received into the house of the orientalist heinrich friedrich von diez ( 1750–1817 ) . he was introduced to pietistic circles in berlin , and came under the influence of baron hans ernst von kottwitz , who became his '' spiritual father , '' and of the historian neander . before deciding on the career of theological professor , he had in view that of a missionary in the east . meanwhile , he was feeling the influence to a certain degree of the romantic school , and of schleiermacher and g . w . f . hegel too , though he never sounded the depths of their systems . at length , in his twenty-first year , he finally decided to adopt the academical calling . in 1821 he was privatdozent and in 1823 became professor extraordinarius of theology in berlin , though he was at the same time active in the work of home and foreign missions . he lectured on the old and new testaments , theology , apologetics and the history of the church in the 18th century . in 1821 appeared his first work , sufismus , sive theosophia persarum pantheistica ; following the same line of study he published blütensammlung aus der morgenlandischen mystik ( 1825 ) and speculative trinitätslehre des späteren orients ( 1826 ) . his well-known essay on the nature and moral influence of heathenism ( 1822 ) was published by neander , with high commendation , in his denkwürdigkeiten ; and his commentary on the epistle to the romans ( 1824 ) secured him a foremost place amongst the most suggestive , if not the most accurate , biblical interpreters of that time . another work , soon translated into all the principal european languages , die wahre weihe des zweiflers ( 1823 ) , the outcome of his own religious history , obtained for him the permanent position of the modern pietistic apologist of evangelical christianity . in 1825 , with the aid of the prussian government , he visited the libraries of england and the netherlands , and on his return was appointed ( in 1826 ) professor ordinarius of theology at the university of halle , the centre of german rationalism , where he afterwards became preacher and member of the supreme consistorial council of the evangelical state church in prussia . here he made it his aim to combine in a higher unity the learning and to some extent the rationalism of johann salomo semler with the devout and active pietism of a h francke ; and , in spite of the opposition of the theological faculty of the university , he succeeded in changing the character of its theology . this he achieved partly by his lectures , but above all by his personal influence on the students , and , after 1833 , by his preaching . his theological position was orthodox , but laid more stress upon christian experience than upon rigid dogmatic belief . on the two great questions of miracles and inspiration he made great concessions to modern criticism and philosophy . his lifelong battle was on behalf of personal religious experience , in opposition to the externality of rationalism , orthodoxy or sacramentarianism . karl schwarz happily remarks that , as the english apologists of the 18th century were themselves infected with the poison of the deists whom they endeavoured to refute , so tholuck absorbed some of the heresies of the rationalists whom he tried to overthrow . he was also one of the prominent members of the evangelische allianz , and few men were more widely known or more beloved throughout the protestant churches of europe and america than him . he died at halle . as a preacher , tholuck ranked among the foremost of his time . as a teacher , he showed remarkable sympathy and won great success . as a thinker he can hardly be said to have been endowed with great creative power . after his commentaries ( on romans , the gospel of john , the sermon on the mount and the epistle to the hebrews ) and several volumes of sermons , his best-known books are stunden christlicher andacht ( 1839 ; 8th ed . , 1870 ) , intended to take the place of j h d zschokke 's standard rationalistic work with the same title , and his reply to david strauss 's life of jesus ( glaubwürdigkeit der evangelischen geschichte , 1837 ) . he published at various times valuable contributions towards a history of rationalism -- vorgeschichte des rationalismus ( 1853–1862 ) , geschichte des rationalismus ( 1865 ) , and a number of essays connected with the history of theology and especially of apologetics . his views on inspiration were indicated in his work die propheten und ihre weissagungen ( 1860 ) , in his essay on the '' alte inspirationslehre , '' in deutsche zeitschrift für christliche wissenschaft ( 1850 ) , and in his gespräche über die vornehmsten glaubensfragen der zeit ( 1846 ; 2nd ed . , 1867 ) . he also contributed many articles to herzog 's realencyklopädie , and for several years edited a journal ( 1830–1849 ) , literarischer anzeiger . references . this work in turn cites : leopold witte , das leben d . friedrich august gotttreu tholuck 's ( 2 vols , 1884–1886 ) . martin kähler , august tholuck . ein lebensabriss ( 1877 ) . martin kähler , '' tholuck '' in herzog 's schaff–herzog encyclopedia of religious knowledge . carl siegfried , '' zur erinnerung an tholuck '' in protestantische kirchzeitung , 1885 , no . 45 , and 1886 , no . 47 . karl schwarz , zur geschichte der neuesten theologie ( 4th ed . , 1869 ) . f . w . f . nippold , handbuch der neuesten kirchengeschichte philip schaff , germany ;
