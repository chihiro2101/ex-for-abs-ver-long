USS Thompson (DD-627)

world war ii . the keel of the second thompson was laid down on 22 september 1941 , at seattle , washington , by the seattle-tacoma shipbuilding corporation . she was launched on 15 july 1942 , sponsored by miss sara thompson ross , and commissioned on 10 july 1943 , with lieutenant commander lee a . ellis in command . following operations along the west coast , thompson departed san diego , on 19 august , bound for the east coast . she arrived at norfolk , virginia on 1 september , prior to departing the next day for the coast of maine and arriving at casco bay on 3 september . the destroyer then headed south to the boston navy yard where she underwent repairs . she next engaged in exercises off the massachusetts coast before returning to casco bay on 23 september for training . on 5 october , she escorted into new york and joined the screen for for nine days of exercises in shore bombardment and other drills before joining convoy ugs-21 which sailed from norfolk , bound for north africa . thompson served as an escort , keeping ships in the channel as they plodded out to sea and prodding them to close up and keep in formation , while her echo-ranging gear was alert for prowling submarines off chesapeake bay . one day out , 16 october , ( ugs.21 sailed from hampton roads on 5 november , and therefore i believe this to be 6 november ) the wind and sea rose , presaging a heavy storm which served to scatter parts of the convoy and cause thompson to note in her log numerous times , '' telling stragglers to close up . '' after the transatlantic voyage , thompson was released from escort duty on 31 october , to proceed to casablanca , french morocco . one week later , the destroyer , attached to desdiv & nbsp ; 36 , was homeward-bound with convoy gus-20 . on 24 november , thompson entered new york harbor with the convoy and then proceeded independently to the new york navy yard for voyage repairs . she sailed for casco bay on 5 december , and conducted refresher training en route . on 7 december , thompson and screened as the battleship conducted high-speed runs and turning trials . later that day , the three ships engaged in night illumination and spotting practice before carrying out the same program on 8 december . after returning to casco bay , thompson again put to sea , bound for norfolk . during the night of 10 december , the winds increased to 70 knots ( 130 & nbsp ; km/h ) with high seas and a low barometer . by 07:35 , it became necessary to rig in her already battered whaleboats and reduce speed to 12 knots ( 22 & nbsp ; km/h ) . thompson put into norfolk on 12 december . two days later she joined convoy ugs-27 , bound for north africa . on 27 december , she made a depth charge run on what her log termed '' a questionable target '' . entering casablanca harbor on 3 january 1944 , thompson and her fellow escorts were soon assigned to convoy gus-27 , bound for norfolk , where they arrived on 24 january . after alternating between new york , boston , and casco bay , she departed norfolk on 18 march , bound for trinidad . invasion of normandy , april–july 1944 . returning to norfolk six days later , thompson operated along the east coast until mid-april when she joined the build-up of forces for the invasion of western europe . on 18 april , she rendezvoused with baldwin , arkansas , , , and the rest of destroyer squadron 18 ( desron18 ) — to which thompson was attached – and sailed for england . this force arrived at plymouth , england , on 28 april , and prepared for duties during the forthcoming invasion . on 4 may 1944 , thompson participated in landing exercise '' fabius '' , one of the many preliminaries to the landing on normandy . on 9 may , she conducted shore bombardment practice at slapton sands , england ; on 13 may , she fired antiaircraft practice off ailsa craig , scotland , and , on 16 may , she engaged in division tactics and further bombardment exercises off the irish coast . on 15 april , she anchored at belfast lough , northern ireland . the following day , 16 april , nevada , texas , and destroyer division 36 ( desdiv & nbsp ; 36 ) departed for exercises off the irish coast before returning to belfast lough . three days later , on 19 april , general dwight d . eisenhower inspected the ship . underway on 20 april , she conducted anti-e-boat exercises through 22 april . in these operations , she fired star shells and practiced illumination tactics for dealing with the foreseen danger of schnellbooten . after more shore bombardment practice , in which her five-inch and bofors gunners exercised at their battle stations and sharpened up their gunnery , she put out of belfast lough for plymouth and thence proceeded to the isle of portland , where she arrived on 27 april . the next day , german heinkel he 111s bombed and mined the harbor , causing no small amount of work for harried minesweeper crews . but , with this danger soon swept away , the allied forces could resume the nearly complete preparations for the upcoming normandy invasion . on 5 june , she joined task group 124.7 ( tg124.7 ) , convoy o-1 , bound for omaha beach . she and her charges arrived off the normandy beaches after an uneventful , but storm-tossed , evening . thompson then received her fire support orders to take station off pointe de la percée as a unit of tg124.9 . en route , she stood to action stations , her guns trained out and ready for any eventuality as the drama of history 's greatest landing operation unfolded around her . she arrived off pointe du hoc as army rangers were struggling to gain a foothold on the rocky promontory . thompson ’ s spotters could not see much at that moment , as army aerial bombardments had obscured the area with smoke and dust . but when the haze cleared away , the destroyer 's main battery opened fire with a vengeance , tongues of flame flashing from her gun muzzles as her salvos screamed shoreward . one by one , her targets of opportunity disappeared as her salvos struck '' on target . '' she then lay-to awaiting remaining enemy guns to reveal themselves with tell-tale flashes . later in the day , she cruised closer inshore and located three giant german würzburg radar antennas . once again , her spotting was deadly accurate , and one of the radar '' dishes '' toppled over , shattered by thompson ’ s shells . soon after , the wreckage of the two other antennas joined the first one in the dust . thompson ’ s smaller guns also got into the fray . her 40 & nbsp ; mm batteries shredded concealments of shore batteries and sniper nests , working in close conjunction with shore spotting teams who ferreted out the hidden enemy . among her other targets was a fortified house . solidly constructed , it had withstood numerous coastal storms . but on 6 june 1944 , its solid norman masonry could not hold up to a few rounds of five-inch ( 127 & nbsp ; mm ) high explosives ; and down it tumbled , into a pile of rubble . the following day , 7 june , thompson ’ s gunners were at it again – this time , in support of the rangers at point du hoc . once more , her 40 & nbsp ; mm and five-inch ( 127 & nbsp ; mm ) batteries shot the enemy out of his sniper nests and gun positions before setting course for portland , to anchor in weymouth bay to replenish her depleted fuel and ammunition stocks . on 8 june , thompson and her companion satterlee ( dd-626 ) steamed back to omaha beach . on the evening of 9 june , the germans struck back in a stealthy e-boat attack . thompson , screening as part of the allied naval craft gathered there , joined in commencing fire on the intruders who were successfully driven off , retiring to the northward at high speed . on 10 june , her 20 & nbsp ; mm and 40 & nbsp ; mm gunners splashed a low-flying german '' snooper '' airplane . at 01:00 on 11 june , another e-boat attack developed from the northward . here , as before , the long hours spent in night illumination and spotting practice exercises paid off handsome dividends . thompson fired star shells , which revealed the shadowy e-boats . british steam gunboats grey wolf ( sgb-8 ) and grey goose ( sgb-9 ) then darted in to ward off the intruders under the watchful eye of the destroyermen . on 12 june , thompson embarked a party ( which included admiral ernest j . king and generals dwight d . eisenhower , george c . marshall , and henry h . arnold ) and transported them across the channel to the invasion beaches at omaha and then returned to plymouth with admiral king and his party embarked . a motor launch with the officers mentioned above was launched to bring them in . an unknown ship was ahead of the motor launch and struck a mine . thompson continued to operate off normandy beaches throughout the remainder of june 1944 , steaming often between the baie de la seine , and plymouth , england . on one occasion , she served as the flagship of rear admiral alan g . kirk , naval commander , western task forces , for a quick visit to cherbourg ; on another , she once more served as a transport for general eisenhower . on 24 july 1944 , thompson steamed for north africa , transiting the straits of gibraltar and arriving at bizerte four days later . underway in company with the rest of destroyer division 36 ( desdiv36 ) on the 29th , she left bizerte bound for oran , algeria , arriving on 30 july . thompson reached naples on 6 august and joined the allied expeditionary forces amassing for operation dragoon , the invasion of southern france . underway with convoy sf-1 , bound for the assault area , thompson served in the screen and patrolled offshore throughout the operation from 15 to 21 august . after a brief tender availability from 28 august to 1 september , she returned to the southern france beachheads to continue patrols through 18 september before steaming to mers-el-kebir , morocco , where she arrived four days later , on 22 september . on 23 september she departed mers-el-kebir and headed for the united states . arriving at bermuda on 1 october , she commenced navy yard availability on 3 october , which lasted through 27 october of that month . for the remainder of 1944 , thompson operated off the east coast of the united states . on 3 january 1945 , the destroyer joined convoy ugs-86 , bound for north african ports . entering mers-el-kebir on 20 january , she remained in north african waters until 1 february , when she joined the screen of convoy gus-68 , en route to the united states . arriving off new york on 13 february , the new york section of the convoy was detached . thompson continued on with the boston section , where she commenced a 10-day availability at the boston navy yard on 15 february . following these repairs , she steamed to norfolk , virginia , conducting gunnery exercises en route . on 1 march , she sortied with convoy ugf-21 , bound for north africa , and arrived in north african waters on 12 march . the following month , after returning to the united states , she again escorted a north african convoy , this time ugs-85 , commencing on 7 april . on 30 may , thompson was reclassified as a fast minesweeper and given hull classification symbol dms-38 . she spent the month of june undergoing conversion for her new mission , commencing on 5 june . she completed her yard work on 29 june . during a post-conversion period , she conducted her first minesweeping exercises , with magnetic sweep equipment , in chesapeake bay . she also calibrated her radar , conducted antiaircraft exercises , and practiced laying mines . on 1 august , she departed the virginia capes and steamed toward the panama canal zone , where she arrived on 7 august . while underway on 14 august , she received the news japan had surrendered . on 18 august , she arrived at san diego . post world war ii . during september , thompson moved westward , stopping at pearl harbor on 8 september and eniwetok on 21 september . arriving at buckner bay on 28 september , she put in just in time to take on fuel and head out to sea as a typhoon swirled north . shortly after the ship returned to buckner bay , yet another typhoon warning scrambled the fleet and set it seaward into the east china sea once more . on 9 october , the center of typhoon louise smashed through okinawa , but thompson was well-clear and suffered no damage . she and her sister-ships in mine division & nbsp ; 61 ( minediv & nbsp ; 61 ) , formed a scouting line four miles ( 6 & nbsp ; km ) apart on 10 october , keeping careful lookout while returning to buckner bay , searching for life rafts , derelicts , or men in the water . on 16 october , thompson , in company with minediv61 , headed to sea from buckner bay to commence sweeping operations in area '' rickshaw '' in the yellow sea . en route the following day , thompson sighted several floating mines and destroyed them by gunfire . on 19 october , the force arrived at '' rickshaw , '' joined by pgm-29 , pgm-30 , and pgm-31 . thompson began her initial actual minesweeping at the northeast end of known mine lanes . the following day , thompson swept her first mine – the first one swept by the task group . by 17 november , '' rickshaw '' had been swept clean of japanese mines , with thompson scoring high with 64 & nbsp ; mines located and destroyed . after a short tender availability at sasebo , japan , the base of operations for minediv & nbsp ; 61 , thompson steamed to nagoya , japan , to become flagship of the task group sweeping nearby waters . completing this operation by mid-december , the minesweeper steamed back via wakayama to sasebo . during the last week in 1945 , she assisted in the unsuccessful search for survivors of minivet ( am-371 ) , sunk by a mine explosion off tsushima , northwest of kyūshū , japan . the ship spent january and february 1946 in japanese home waters , and then steamed for bikini atoll to assist in sweeping operations to prepare the area for operation crossroads tests of atomic bombs to be conducted there in july . before the tests took place , thompson headed back to the united states . she remained at san francisco , through july and then spent two months in overhaul at the mare island naval shipyard , vallejo , california . from mare island , she returned to san francisco to operate out of that port until late in the year . after six months of operation at san francisco , she sailed for china on 10 february 1947 , and proceeded via pearl harbor , guam , and kwajalein to qingdao . following six months duty with american occupation forces in chinese waters , thompson returned to the united states in early september 1947 and arrived at san diego , california , on 2 october . transferred to the operational command of destroyers , pacific fleet , with the abolition of the pacific fleet minecraft command , thompson operated out of san diego as a destroyer until 29 april 1948 , when she returned again to mare island for a two-month overhaul . in july , she returned to san diego and underwent training operations off the west coast , activities in which she was engaged for the remainder of 1948 . in january 1949 , thompson again set course for china in company with destroyer division 52 . en route , however , the ships received orders to put about for the west coast after spending a few days in hawaii , arriving at san diego on 4 february 1949 . thompson and three of her sister fast-minesweepers then became mine squadron one ( mineron 1 ) and were assigned to the general line school at monterey , california . they alternated in these operations between monterey and san diego for the remainder of 1949 . after spending the first three months of 1950 in routine exercises and cruises out of san diego , thompson steamed for pearl harbor on 6 april 1950 , for a three-month overhaul . korean war . while in the yard , she received news that north korean armed forces had invaded south korea crossing the 38th parallel . completing her overhaul ahead of schedule , thompson returned to san diego on 20 july and began an accelerated and rigorous underway training period which lasted through august and part of september 1950 . on 4 october 1950 , thompson and sister ship departed san diego , and arrived at pearl harbor five days later . the next day , they got underway for midway atoll . twenty-four hours from their destination , orders directed them to patrol off wake island during the meeting of general douglas macarthur and president harry truman . thompson remained there overnight , refueling at sea from before proceeding to japan , arriving at sasebo on 21 october . while thompson and carmick had steamed across the pacific , united nations forces had been rallying after the initial heavy losses and retreats at the hands of the communist armies . accordingly , the american eighth army put heavy pressure on north korean troops , pushing them towards p'yŏngyang , on the west coast of korea . this thrust was stretching the army 's supply lanes . to remedy this problem , an operation was mounted to open up the mined port of chinnampo , some 50 & nbsp ; km southwest of p'yŏngyang , at the mouth of the taedong river . this required ingenuity and resourcefulness , not least because of a lack of minesweeping craft at the start of operations . thompson and carmick , newly arrived in the '' land of the morning calm '' , were detailed to join the makeshift minesweeping organization recently established under commander stephen m . archer . consisting of , , , , , and , japanese lst & nbsp ; q-007 , four republic of korea minesweepers , and a helicopter from , this task force performed a nearly impossible feat in slightly over two weeks . before too long , american ships were bringing in supplies to the advancing eighth army . after a week of patrol duties off the newly swept port escorting logistics ships now able to utilize the channel , thompson left the bitterly cold region behind for a week of repairs and resupply at sasebo . in early november , however , the entry of chinese communist forces into the war vastly altered the strategic picture . in the face of heavy onslaughts , united nations troops retreated . one port which served as an evacuation point was chinnampo , familiar to thompson ’ s men as a result of the minesweeping operation conducted a scant month before . while united nations warships conducted bombardments of advancing communist troops , thompson escorted troopships out of the harbor in dense fog and through treacherous tidal currents to assist in the evacuation . for her part in this action , thompson received the navy unit commendation . after replenishment , she served as harbor control vessel at incheon , korea . two days after christmas , she suddenly received orders to head for sasebo , where mineron 1 was to be regrouped . arriving at the japanese port on 27 december , she departed on 30 december 1950 , in company with and for minesweeping assignments on the east coast of korea . there , she spent close to three weeks engaged in clearance sweeps so that support ships could take fire-support stations to assist ground forces ashore . in late january 1951 , after a month in the arduous and cold conditions of that region , thompson returned to sasebo for repairs . these included drydocking for work on the hull , and , as a result of the docking period , the availability was extended another three weeks , before she departed for minesweeping operations again in mid-february . using wonsan as a base , she operated to the northward , eventually sweeping kyoto wan deep , south of the manchurian border . while sweeping off the key railway nexus of sŏngjin , thompson ran across a new minefield and cut seven mines as she passed through on her sweep . later , she operated in the screen for and , while they operated in that area on shore bombardment duties . at chuuron jang , she herself destroyed two railroad bridges with her pinpoint gunnery . also during this period , she took part in '' junk-busting '' operations up and down the coast , being on the lookout for suspicious junks used by communist forces for infiltration and minelaying operations . on one occasion , while underway north of sŏngjin , she sighted six north korean junks in a cove . once again , as at the normandy '' d-day '' landings , thompson ’ s gunners opened fire with a vengeance and sank all six communist boats . after a month of such operations , she returned to sasebo for upkeep . from 1 april 1951 to 3 november , thompson returned to shell communist defense positions , supply lines , and troop concentrations . on 14 june , however , it was the enemy 's turn to hit back . thompson ’ s gunners had just completed the destruction of a railroad bridge near sŏngjin when communist shore batteries opened fire , soon straddling the ship . one shell struck the bridge and knocked out the ship 's fire control gear . in retaliation , thompson ’ s gunners destroyed one enemy battery and damaged another . with three dead and three wounded , thompson retired . on 3 november 1951 , thompson departed from korean waters , homeward bound . she steamed into san diego bay on 20 november and thence proceeded to the mare island naval shipyard for overhaul . after post-repair trials , she conducted operations on the west coast and underwent a restricted availability at long beach , california . thompson spent the remainder of 1951 and the first part of 1952 in continental united states waters before departing san diego on 23 june 1952 . arriving at pearl harbor six days later , she continued on to yokosuka , where she arrived on 18 july . after a short availability alongside destroyer tender , thompson proceeded to sŏngjin , arriving off that port on 11 august 1952 . in contrast to her earlier korean tours , when her minesweeping duties were intermingled with destroyer-type operations , thompson was now free to operate as a destroyer for coast patrol and gunfire support duties . sweeping was now done by ams and amss and was all done at night . the communists , too , had changed tactics . more guns were brought in to defend the coasts , while enemy accuracy had improved as well . on 20 august 1952 , once more off sŏngjin , thompson was taken under fire by a chinese battery . a shell hit the flying bridge , killing four and wounding nine . thompson attempted to return the fire , but the excellently concealed shore guns made the return shelling 's accuracy difficult and ineffective . retiring from the scene , the stricken thompson transferred her casualties to , then operating 16 miles ( 30 & nbsp ; km ) south of sŏngjin . five days later , the minesweeper arrived at sasebo on 26 august for tender availability , repairing her engines and battle damage , before she headed north to sŏngjin . she remained off this unlucky port from 13 september to 12 october 1952 , occasionally patrolling to the northernmost extremity of the united nations blockade before again returning to sasebo . from 3 november to 1 december 1952 , thompson operated in wonsan harbor , as part of the united nations blockade forces there . as such , she was in range of communist guns on many occasions . the object of enemy fire at least four times , thompson received damage for the third time when straddled on 20 november 1952 , while acting as gunfire support ship for which was conducting a sweep of the inner harbor . from three widely spaced points enemy guns took the minesweepers under fire , catching thompson amidships on the starboard side as she was laying clouds of oily black smoke between kite and the shoreline . returning to yokosuka for repairs to the battle damage , thompson spent christmas in that japanese naval port . new year 's , however , once again found the fast minesweeper at sŏngjin . after two more tours there , into february 1953 , thompson headed back to the united states in company with carmick . with refueling stops at midway and pearl harbor , she finally arrived at san diego on 14 march 1953 . post korean war . operating with minediv 11 , thompson was based on the west coast for the remainder of the year . beginning on 8 june 1953 , she played the title role in columbia pictures 's '' the caine mutiny '' , the 1954 film adaptation of the the caine mutiny of the same name . operating out of san francisco for one week , thompson became the caine , while serving as the model for many of the columbia sets used in the filming of the on-board scenes . after taking part in two exercises in late september 1953 , she operated out of san diego until 1 december 1953 , when she reported to the pacific reserve fleet to prepare for inactivation . on 18 may 1954 , thompson ’ s commission pennant was hauled down and the ship placed in reserve . on 16 july 1956 , she was reclassified as a destroyer and redesignated dd-627 . she was struck from the naval vessel register on 1 july 1971 , and sold to the american ship dismantlers of portland , oregon , on 7 august 1972 , for scrapping . awards . navy unit
