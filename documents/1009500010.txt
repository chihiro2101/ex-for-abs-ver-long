Ealing Studios

history . film studios ( 1902–1955 ) . the site was first occupied by will barker studios from 1902 . from 1929 , it was acquired by theatre producer basil dean , who founded associated talking pictures ltd . he was joined on the management level by stephen courtauld and reginald baker . in 1931 , they built ealing studios , transferring all production there in december of that year . when dean left in 1938 to be replaced by michael balcon from mgm , about 60 films had been made at the studios . balcon discontinued the atp name and began to issue films under the ealing studios name . in 1944 , the company was taken over by the rank organisation . in the 1930s and 1940s , the facility as atp and then ealing studios produced many comedies with stars such as gracie fields , george formby , stanley holloway and will hay , who had established their reputations in other spheres of entertainment . the company was also instrumental in the use of documentary film-makers to make more realistic war films . these included went the day well ? ( 1942 ) , the foreman went to france ( 1942 ) , undercover ( 1943 ) , and san demetrio london ( 1943 ) . in 1945 , the studio made its influential chiller compendium dead of night . in the post-war period , the company embarked on a series of comedies which became the studio 's hallmark . these were often lightly satirical and were seen to reflect aspects of british character and society . the first was hue and cry ( 1947 ) and the last barnacle bill ( 1956 ) . the best remembered ealing films were produced between 1948 and 1955 : whisky galore ! ( 1949 ) , passport to pimlico ( 1949 ) , kind hearts and coronets ( 1949 ) , the lavender hill mob ( 1951 ) , the man in the white suit ( 1951 ) , the titfield thunderbolt ( 1953 ) , the cruel sea ( 1953 ) and the ladykillers ( 1955 ) are now seen as classics of british cinema . owned by the bbc ( 1955–1995 ) . the bbc bought the studios in 1955 , though productions bearing the ealing name continued to be made at the mgm british studios at borehamwood for two years . the bbc based its film department at the studios ; and at its peak 56 film crews used the studios as a base for location filming of dramas , documentaries and other programmes ; shot on 16 & nbsp ; mm and occasionally 35 & nbsp ; mm film . '' a history of the bbc 's film department '' , by david martin ( 1983 ) . led by a director , these crews usually consisted of a lighting cameraman , a camera assistant , a lighting technician ( known as a 'spark ' ) , and a sound recordist . initially these crews were equipped with arriflex st cameras and emi l2 quarter inch tape recorders that had to be tethered to one another with a physical sync cable to ensure the picture and sound ran in lock . in later years , eclair npr cameras replaced the arriflex machines and nagra tape recorders replaced the emi units . the nagras made use of 'crystal sync ' , a system that provided synchronisation between the camera and the tape recorder remotely , removing the need for a physical cable . there were also over 50 cutting rooms , equipped with steenbeck editing tables , working on every genre except news and current affairs . many programmes came out of ealing from alistair cooke 's america edited by alan tyrer and photographed by kenneth macmillan to z-cars edited by shelia tomlinson and many others and cathy come home edited by roy watts , assisted by roger waugh . these programmes had post production support , viewing theatres , transfer suites , dubbing theatre , maintenance ; all these staff and the film crews made up what was fondly known as the tfs family . in the 1980s , the bbc developed and expanded the use of electronic psc ( portable single camera ) location equipment and the use of 16 & nbsp ; mm film on location gradually declined . the bbc also used the studio facilities at ealing for filmed inserts where an electronic studio could not be used , such as for the excavation site in quatermass and the pit ( 1958–59 ) , the white rabbit ( tv mini-series , 1967 ) , colditz ( 1972–74 ) and the communal sequences in porridge ( 1974–77 ) . programmes wholly shot on film were made there also , such as alice in wonderland ( 1966 ) , the singing detective ( 1986 ) , portrait of a marriage , ( 1986 ) and fortunes of war ( 1987 ) . the bbc had preview theatres to run 16 & nbsp ; mm sepmag film and 35 & nbsp ; mm . the 16 & nbsp ; mm machines were bauer and the 35 & nbsp ; mm projectors kalee 21 . the projection area was a long room ( open plan ) with projectors serving theatres e -j . there was a separate projection room in the same area for theatre k , which was 35 & nbsp ; mm . there was also a dubbing theatre b , where 16 & nbsp ; mm productions would be dubbed , and film dispatch and sound transfer suites , where the quarter-inch tape from nagra tape machines would be transferred to 16 & nbsp ; mm magnetic film . film previews ran rushes , cutting copies , synch rushes , answer prints and transmission prints before going to telecine . with the bbc seeking to reduce costs and in particular studio facilities , a decision was taken to sell ealing studios on the open market . although a sale was agreed with bbrk , the bbc inserted a buy-back clause so that in the event that bbrk ( for whatever reasons ) put the site up for sale then the bbc would have first option to purchase . bbrk found it necessary to sell the site and the bbc repurchased the site and sold it on for £1.00 to the national film and television school , ( nfts ) . 1995 to present . in 1995 , the studios were purchased by the nfts and again in mid-2000 by a consortium led by fragile films ' uri fruchtmann and barnaby thompson , harry handelsman and john kao , with an intention to revive the fortunes of the studio . handelsman 's manhattan loft corporation redeveloped the 3.8-acre site to include the existing grade ii listed sound stages . the studio has since begun to produce theatrical films again , such as lucky break ( 2001 ) , the importance of being earnest ( 2002 ) , and valiant ( 2005 ) . shaun of the dead and horror film the descent ( 2005 ) were both shot on the lot . in 2007 , ealing revived the st trinian 's franchise , the second film , st . trinian 's , the legend of fritton 's gold was released in december 2009 and took over £7 million at the uk box office . between these , ealing released easy virtue ( 2008 ) , directed by stephan elliott and dorian gray ( 2009 ) , directed by oliver parker . ealing studios is used by the met film school london , which has a purposely built film school on the lot and use of the studios . itv drama downton abbey filmed the kitchen and servants ' quarters on stages 3a and 3b . the studio is also home to the imaginarium , a production company and studio specializing in performance-capture , founded by andy serkis and jonathan cavendish . ealing studios films . basil dean/atp era . . bbc tv productions . quatermass and the pit ( inserts only ;
