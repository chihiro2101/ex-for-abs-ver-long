early life . bragg was born in 1957 in barking , essex , one of the sons of dennis frederick austin bragg , an assistant sales manager to a barking cap maker and milliner , and his wife marie victoria d'urso , who was of italian descent . bragg 's father died of lung cancer in 1976 , and his mother in 2011 . bragg was educated at northbury junior school and park modern secondary school ( now part of barking abbey school in barking , where he failed his eleven-plus , effectively precluding him from going to university . however he developed an interest in poetry at the age of twelve , when his english teacher chose him to read a poem he had written for a homework assignment on a local radio station . he put his energies into learning and practising the guitar with his next-door neighbour , philip wigg ( wiggy ) ; some of their influences were the faces , small faces and the rolling stones . he was also exposed to folk and folk-rock music during his teenage years , citing simon & garfunkel and bob dylan as early influences on his songwriting . bragg was particularly influenced by the clash , whom he 'd seen play live in london in may 1977 on their white riot tour , and again at a rock against racism carnival in april 1978 , which he admits was the first time he really stepped into the world of music as it is used for political activism . the experience of the gig and preceding march helped shape bragg 's left-wing politics , having previously '' turned a blind eye '' to casual racism . . career . early career . in 1977 bragg formed the punk rock/pub rock band riff raff with wiggy . the band decamped to rural oundle in northamptonshire in 1978 to record a series of singles ( the first on independent chiswick records ) which did not receive wide exposure . after a period of gigging in northamptonshire and london , they returned to barking and split in 1980 . taking a series of odd jobs including working at guy norris ' record shop in barking high street . bragg became disillusioned with his stalled music career and in may 1981 joined the british army as a recruit destined for the queen 's royal irish hussars of the royal armoured corps . after completing three months ' basic training , he bought himself out for £175 and returned home . bragg peroxided his hair to mark a new phase in his life and began performing frequent concerts and busking around london , playing solo with an electric guitar under the name spy vs spy ( after the strip in mad magazine ) . his demo tape initially got no response from the record industry , but by pretending to be a television repair man , he got into the office of charisma records ' a & r man peter jenner . jenner liked the tape , but the company was near bankruptcy and had no budget to sign new artists . bragg got an offer to record more demos for music publisher chappell & co . , so jenner agreed to release them as a record . life 's a riot with spy vs spy ( credited to billy bragg ) was released in july 1983 by charisma 's new imprint , utility . hearing dj john peel mention on-air that he was hungry , bragg rushed to the bbc with a mushroom biryani , so peel played a song from life 's a riot with spy vs spy albeit at the wrong speed ( since the 12 '' lp was , unconventionally , cut to play at 45rpm ) . peel insisted he would have played the song even without the biryani and later played it at the correct speed . within months charisma had been taken over by virgin records and jenner , who had been made redundant , became bragg 's manager . stiff records ' press officer andy macdonald – who was setting up his own record label , go ! discs – received a copy of life 's a riot with spy vs spy . he made virgin an offer and the album was re-released on go ! discs in november 1983 , at the fixed low price of £2.99 . around this time , andy kershaw , an early supporter at radio aire in leeds , was employed by jenner as bragg 's tour manager . ( he later became a bbc dj and tv presenter , and he and bragg appeared in an episode of the bbc tv programme great journeys in 1989 , in which they travelled the silver road from potosí , bolivia , to the pacific coast at arica , chile . ) though never released as a bragg single , album track and live favourite '' a new england '' , with an additional verse , became a top 10 hit in the uk for kirsty maccoll in january 1985 . since maccoll 's early death , bragg always sings the extra verse live in her honour . in 1984 , he released brewing up with billy bragg , a mixture of political songs ( e.g . '' it says here '' ) and songs of unrequited love ( e.g . '' the saturday boy '' ) . this was followed in 1985 by between the wars , an ep of political songs that included a cover version of leon rosselson 's '' diggers ' song '' . the ep made the top 20 of the uk singles chart and earned bragg an appearance on top of the pops , singing the title track . bragg later collaborated with rosselson on the song , '' ballad of a spycatcher '' . in the same year , he embarked on his first tour of north america , with wiggy as tour manager , supporting echo & the bunnymen . the tour began in washington d.c . and ended in los angeles . on the same trip , in new york , bragg unveiled his '' portastack '' , a self-contained , mobile pa system weighing 35 & nbsp ; lbs ( designed for £500 by engineer kenny jones ) , the wearing of which became an archetypal image of the singer at that time . with it , he was able to busk outside the new music seminar , a record industry conference . late 1980s and early 1990s . in 1986 bragg released talking with the taxman about poetry , which became his first top 10 album . its title is taken from a poem by vladimir mayakovsky and a translated version of the poem was printed on the record 's inner sleeve . back to basics is a 1987 collection of his first three releases : life 's a riot with spy vs spy , brewing up with billy bragg , and between the wars . he enjoyed his only number 1 hit single in may 1988 , a cover of the beatles ' '' she 's leaving home '' , a shared a-side with wet wet wet 's '' with a little help from my friends '' . both were taken from a multi-artist re-recording of sgt . pepper 's lonely hearts club band titled sgt . pepper knew my father coordinated by the nme in aid of the charity childline . wet wet wet 's cover dominated radio airplay and its video was shown over three consecutive weeks on top of the pops ; in week four , bragg went on the programme to play his cover , with regular accompanist cara tivey on piano . bragg released his fourth album , workers playtime , in september 1988 . with this album , bragg added a full backing band and accompaniment , including tivey on piano , danny thompson on double bass and veteran micky waller on drums . wiggy earned a co-production credit with joe boyd . in may 1990 bragg released the political mini-lp the internationale on his and jenner 's own short-lived label utility , which operated independently of go ! discs , to which bragg was still contracted . the songs were , in part , a return to his solo guitar style , but some featured more complicated arrangements and included a brass band . the album paid tribute to one of bragg 's influences with the song , '' i dreamed i saw phil ochs last night '' , which is an adapted version of earl robinson 's song , '' i dreamed i saw joe hill last night '' , itself an adaptation of a poem by alfred hayes . though the album only reached number 34 in the uk charts , bragg described it as '' a reassertion of my rights as an individual . and a childish two fingers to go ! discs boss andy macdonald , who 'd recently signed a distribution deal with entertainment industry giant polygram . '' his sixth studio album do n't try this at home was recorded in the shadow of the build-up to the gulf war and subsequent ground war , inspiring the track '' rumours of war '' . although there is social comment ( '' the few '' , '' north sea bubble '' ) , it was intended as a more commercial pop album , released in september 1991 . ( bragg called it '' a very long-range attempt to convert the ball between the posts . '' . the first single was the upbeat '' sexuality '' , which , despite an accessible video and a dance remix on the b-side , only reached number 27 on the uk singles chart . following overtures by rival label chrysalis , bragg and jenner had been persuaded by go ! discs ' andy and juliet macdonald to sign a four-album deal for a million pound advance ; in return he would promote the album with singles and videos . a more commercial sound and aggressive marketing had no appreciable effect on album sales , and after a grueling , 13-month world tour with a full band ( the red stars , led by wiggy ) , and a period of forced convalescence after an appendicitis , bragg left go ! discs in summer 1992 , paying back the remainder of his advance in return for all rights to his back catalogue . late 1990s and 2000s . bragg released the album william bloke in 1996 after taking time off to help new partner juliet wills raise their son jack .

'' bragg has cited the clash as a strong influence on his politically-themed material and activism : it was n't so much their lyrics as what they stood for and the actions they took . that became really important to me . phil collins might write a another day in paradise , but if he does n't have the action to go with it he 's just exploiting that for a subject . i got that from the clash , and i try to remain true to that tradition as best i can . . from 1983 to 1997 . bragg 's politics were focused by the conservative party 's 144-seat majority landslide at the 1983 general election . he told his biographer , '' by 1983 , the scales had fallen from my eyes .

'' trying to make it sexy is impossible , '' he said . at the time of the 2001 general election , bragg promoted tactical voting in an attempt to unseat conservative party candidates in his adopted home county dorset , particularly in south dorset and west dorset . the conservatives did indeed narrowly lose south dorset to the labour party . bragg has been an opponent of fascism , racism , bigotry , sexism and homophobia , and is a supporter of a multi-racial britain . as a result , he has conflicted with far-right groups such as the british national party ( bnp ) . in a 2004 the guardian article , bragg was quoted as saying : the british national party would probably make it into a parliament elected by proportional representation , too . it would shine a torch into the dirty little corner where the bnp defecate on our democracy , and that would be much more powerful than duffing them up in the street – which i 'm also in favour of . during the 2005 general election campaign in the bethnal green and bow constituency , bragg endorsed oona king , the labour party 's pro-iraq war candidate , over george galloway , the left-wing socialist anti-war candidate from the respect party ; due to a belief that splitting the left-wing vote would allow the conservatives to win the seat . galloway overturned king 's 10,000-strong majority to become the respect party 's only mp . at the nme awards in 2007 , on the fifth anniversary of joe strummer 's death , bragg founded jail guitar doors ( taking its name from a jail guitar doors ) , an organisation aimed at supplying instruments to prisons and encouraging prisoners to address problems in a non-confrontational way . an american chapter of the organisation was launched in 2009 by mc5 's wayne kramer . in january 2010 , bragg stated his intention to withhold his income tax as a protest against the royal bank of scotland 's plan to pay bonuses of approximately of £1,500,000,000 to staff in its investment banking business . bragg set up a facebook group , made appearances on radio and television news programmes , and made a speech at speakers ' corner in london 's hyde park saying , '' millions are already facing stark choices : are they willing to work longer hours for less money , or would they rather be unemployed ? i don ’ t see why the bankers at rbs shouldn ’ t be asked the same . '' . from 2010 to 2014 . in the 2010 general election , bragg supported the liberal democrats because '' they 've got the best manifesto '' . bragg was also very active in his hometown of barking as part of searchlight magazine 's hope not hate campaign , where the bnp 's leader nick griffin was standing for election . at one point during the campaign bragg squared up to bnp london assembly richard barnbrook , calling him a '' fascist racist '' and saying '' when you 're gone from this borough , we will rebuild this community '' . the bnp came third on election day . in january 2011 , news sources reported that 20 to 30 residents of bragg 's dorset hometown , burton bradstock , had received anonymous letters viciously attacking him and his politics , and urging residents to oppose him in the village . he claimed that a bnp supporter was behind the letters , which argued that bragg is a hypocrite for advocating socialism while living a wealthy lifestyle , and referred to him as anti-british and pro-immigration . in july 2011 bragg joined the growing protests over the news of the world phone hacking affair with the release of his '' never buy the sun '' single , which references many of the scandal 's key points including the milly dowler case , police bribes and associated political fallout . it also draws on the 22-year liverpool boycott of the sun for their coverage of the hillsborough disaster . in october 2011 , bragg joined the occupy movement protests in the city of london . in 2013 , despite his scathing criticism of margaret thatcher , he urged people not to celebrate the death of the former conservative prime minister : the death of margaret thatcher is nothing more than a salient reminder of how britain got into the mess that we are in today . of why ordinary working people are no longer able to earn enough from one job to support a family ; of why there is a shortage of decent affordable housing . of why cynicism and greed became the hallmarks of our society . raising a glass to the death of an infirm old lady changes none of this . the only real antidote to cynicism is activism . do n't celebrate – organise ! , cited in in 2014 , bragg joined the march in march anti-government protests in sydney , australia . in june 2014 , bragg joined other musicians ( including radiohead 's ed o'brien ) in backing a call for the eu to intervene in a dispute between youtube and independent labels . according to a bbc news report , the video-streaming site was offering '' non-negotiable contracts '' to its planned , spotify-like music-subscription service to labels such as xl recordings , 4ad , cooking vinyl and domino '' accompanied by the threat that music videos they have posted to their youtube channels will be blocked from site altogether if they do not agree to the terms . '' bragg supports both scottish and welsh independence . in 2014 , after david bowie spoke in favour of scotland remaining part of the uk , bragg said , '' bowie 's intervention encourages people in england to discuss the issues of the independence referendum , and i think english people should be discussing it , so i welcome his intervention . '' bragg was a vocal supporter of scottish independence during the campaign prior to the referendum on 18 september 2014 . bragg wrote an article for the guardian publication on 16 september , in which he addressed the objections he had previously received from people who conflated scottish nationalism with the far-right ethos of the bnp . he described the independence campaign as '' civic nationalism '' and his opinion piece concluded : support for scottish self-determination might not fit neatly into any leftwing pigeonhole , but it does chime with an older progressive tradition that runs deep in english history – a dogged determination to hold the over-mighty to account . if , during the constitutional settlement that will follow the referendum , we in england can rediscover our roundhead tradition , we might yet counter our historic weakness for ethnic nationalism with an outpouring of civic engagement that creates a fairer society for all . . 2015 to present . bragg was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the green party 's caroline lucas at the 2015 general election . in august 2015 , bragg endorsed jeremy corbyn 's campaign in the labour party leadership election . he said : '' his corbyn 's success so far shows you how bland our politics have become , in the aim of winning those swing voters in middle england the labour party has lost touch with its roots . we live in a time of austerity and what you want from that is not more austerity , you want compassion . '' on an edition of question time in october 2015 , he said that corbyn represents a political '' urge for change '' and that ed miliband had failed to win the 2015 general election because miliband and the party followed '' the old way of doing things '' . in 2016 , bragg , along with numerous other celebrities , toured the uk to support corbyn 's bid to become prime minister . he also voiced his support for remain in the 2016 eu referendum . in august 2016 , the times reported that at the edinburgh book festival , bragg had said : '' i worry about jeremy that he 's a kind of twentieth century labour man '' , and that '' we need to be reaching out to people '' . described as a '' previously loyal supporter '' , who has '' lent his support to mr corbyn on numerous occasions since he became labour leader '' , the times quoted bragg : '' i do n't have a simple answer . my hope is that the party does not split and that we resolve this stalemate '' . corbyn at the time was campaigning in an enforced second leadership election in the summer of 2016 . after the times article appeared , the singer tweeted that he had '' joined the long list of people stitched up by the murdoch papers '' and accused the times of '' twisting my words to attack corbyn '' , urging '' don ’ t let murdoch sow discord '' . the guardian reproduced a quote from a recording of the event absent from the times article : '' it 's a challenge . labour has fires to fight on different fronts . this would be happening even without corbyn if any of the other candidates had won last year , these problems would still be there '' . in august 2016 , bragg also endorsed jeremy corbyn 's campaign in the labour party leadership election . during the general election campaign in may 2017 , bragg added his signature to a letter published in the guardian calling for labour to withdraw its candidates in two constituencies ; brighton pavilion and the isle of wight and potentially allowing the green party to defeat the tories in both , where labour were running second . the letter was also signed by labour mp clive lewis , former policy chief jon cruddas , former shadow children 's minister tulip siddiq and journalists paul mason and owen jones . the initiative was shut down by jeremy corbyn . in june 2019 , bragg publicly criticised fellow singer-songwriter morrissey for his recent political comments and endorsement of a far-right political party , and accused him of dragging the legacy of johnny marr and the smiths '' through the dirt '' . in november 2019 , bragg endorsed the labour party in the 2019 uk general election . . bibliography . . discography . life 's a riot with spy vs spy ( 1983 ) brewing up with billy bragg ( 1984 ) talking with the taxman about poetry ( 1986 ) workers playtime ( 1988 ) the internationale ( 1990 ) do n't try this at home ( 1991 ) william bloke ( 1996 ) england , half-english ( 2002 ) ( with the blokes ) mr love & justice ( 2008 ) tooth & nail ( 2013 ) bridges not walls ( 2017 ) best of billy bragg at the bbc 1983 - 2019 ( 2019 )
