IBM 701

history . ibm 701 competed with remington rand 's univac 1103 in the scientific computation market , which had been developed for the nsa , so it was held secret until permission to market it was obtained in 1951 . in early 1954 , a committee of the joint chiefs of staff requested that the two machines be compared for the purpose of using them for a joint numerical weather prediction project . based on the trials , the two machines had comparable computational speed , with a slight advantage for ibm 's machine , but the univac was favored unanimously for its significantly faster input-output equipment . emerson pugh , lyle r . johnson , john h . palmer , ibm 's 360 and early 370 systems , mit press , 1991 , pp . 23-34 at the lawrence livermore national laboratory , an ibm 701 meant that scientists could run nuclear explosives computations faster . nineteen ibm 701 systems were installed . the first 701 was delivered to ibm 's world headquarters in new york . eight went to aircraft companies . '' i think there is a world market for maybe five computers '' is often attributed to thomas watson , senior in 1943 and junior at several dates in the 1950s . this misquote is from the 1953 ibm annual stockholders ' meeting . thomas watson jr . was describing the market acceptance of the ibm 701 computer . before production began , watson visited with 20 companies that were potential customers . this is what he said at the stockholders ' meeting , '' as a result of our trip , on which we expected to get orders for five machines , we came home with orders for 18 ” . aviation week for 11 may 1953 says the 701 rental charge was about 12,000 a month ; american aviation 9 nov 1953 says '' 15,000 a month per 40-hour shift . a second 40-hour shift ups the rental to 20,000 a month '' . the successor of the 701 was the index register-equipped ibm 704 , introduced 4 years after the 701 . the 704 was not compatible with the 701 , however , as the 704 increased the size of instructions from 18 bits to 36 bits to support the extra features . the 704 also marked the transition to magnetic core memory . social impact . in 1952 ibm paired with language scholars from georgetown university to develop a translation software for use on computers . on january 7 , 1954 , the team developed an experimental software program that allowed the ibm 701 computer to translate from russian to english . the mark 1 translating device , which was developed for the us air force , was able to produce its first automated russian-to-english translation in 1959 and was shown to the public in 1964 . in 1954 , a group of scientists ran millions of simulated hands of blackjack on an ibm 701 looking to determine the best playing decision for every combination of cards . the result of the study was the set of correct rules for hitting , standing , doubling or splitting in a blackjack game which are still the same today . the ibm 701 can claim to be the first computer displaying the potential of artificial intelligence in arthur samuel 's checkers-playing program on february 24 , 1956 . the program , which was developed for play on the ibm 701 , was demonstrated to the public on television . self-proclaimed checkers master robert nealey played the game on an ibm 7094 computer in 1962 and the computer won . it is still considered a milestone for artificial intelligence and it offered the public during the early 1960s an example of the capabilities of an electronic computer . the lawrence livermore national laboratory developed a language compilation and runtime system called the kompiler for their ibm 701 . speedcode was the first high-level programming language created for an ibm computer . the language was developed by john backus in 1953 for the ibm 701 to support computation with floating point . the fortran compiler also developed by backus was not released by ibm until the ibm 704 . ibm 701 customers . ibm world headquarters , new york , n.y .
