Aviation accidents and incidents

major disasters . the first aircraft incident in which 200 or more people died occurred on march 3 , 1974 , when 346 died in the crash of turkish airlines flight 981 . , there have been 33 aviation incidents in which 200 or more people died . the largest loss of life on board a single-aircraft is the 520 fatalities in the 1985 japan airlines flight 123 incident , the largest loss of life in multiple aircraft in a single incident is the 583 fatalities in the two airplanes that collided in the 1977 tenerife airport disaster , while the largest loss of life overall in a collective incident is the 2,996 fatalities in the coordinated terrorist destruction of airplanes and occupied buildings in the 2001 september 11 attacks . september 11 attacks . 2,996 : the deadliest aviation-related disaster of any kind , considering fatalities on both the aircraft and the ground , was the destruction of the world trade center in new york city on september 11 , 2001 . on that morning , four commercial aircraft traveling on transcontinental flights from east coast airports to california were hijacked after takeoff . the four hijacked aircraft were subsequently crashed in four separate suicide attacks against major american landmarks , by 19 islamic terrorism affiliated with al-qaeda . american airlines flight 11 and united airlines flight 175 were intentionally crashed into the north and south towers respectively of the world trade center , collapse of the world trade center . the world trade center crashes killed 2,753 , the vast majority of fatalities being occupants of the world trade center towers or emergency personnel responding to the disaster . in addition , 184 were killed by american airlines flight 77 , which crashed into the pentagon ( causing severe damage and partial destruction to the building 's west side ) . 40 passengers were also killed when united airlines flight 93 crashed into a somerset county , pennsylvania field after passengers fought back and prevented the hijackers from reaching their designated target . this brought the casualties of the september 11 attacks . as deliberate terrorist acts , the 9/11 crashes were not classified as accidents , but as a mass-killing ; these events were subsequently treated by the united states and the member nations of nato as an act of war and terrorism . tenerife disaster . 583 : the tenerife airport disaster , which occurred on march 27 , 1977 , remains the accident with the highest number of airliner passenger fatalities . 583 people died when a klm boeing 747 attempted to take off without flight clearance , and collided with a taxiing pan am 747 at los rodeos airport on the canary island of tenerife , spain . all 234 passengers and 14 crew of the klm aircraft died and only 61 of the 396 passengers and crew of the pan am aircraft survived . pilot error was the primary cause , as the klm captain began his takeoff run without obtaining air traffic control clearance . other contributing factors were a terrorist incident at gran canaria airport that had caused many flights to be diverted to los rodeos , a small airport not well equipped to handle aircraft of such size , and dense fog . the klm flight crew could not see the pan am aircraft on the runway until immediately before the collision . the accident had a lasting influence on the industry , particularly in the area of communication . an increased emphasis was placed on using standardized phraseology in air traffic control ( atc ) communication by both controllers and pilots alike . '' cockpit resource management '' has also been incorporated into flight crew training . the captain is no longer considered infallible , and combined crew input is encouraged during aircraft operations . . jal flight 123 . 520 : the crash of japan airlines flight 123 on august 12 , 1985 , is the single-aircraft disaster with the highest number of fatalities : 520 people died on board a boeing 747 . the aircraft suffered an explosive decompression from an incorrectly repaired aft pressure bulkhead , which failed in mid flight , destroying most of its vertical stabilizer and severing all of the hydraulic lines , making the 747 virtually uncontrollable . pilots were able to keep the plane flying for 32 minutes after the mechanical failure before crashing into a mountain . all 15 crew members and 505 of the 509 passengers on board died . '' aircraft accident investigation report japan air lines co . , ltd . boeing 747 sr-100 , ja8119 gunma prefecture , japan august 12 , 1985 . '' 22 ( 33/332 ) . retrieved august 18 , 2010 . japanese military personnel inaccurately assumed , during a helicopter flyover of the impact site , that there were no survivors . rescue operations were delayed until the following morning . medical providers involved in rescue and analysis operations determined that several passengers likely survived the impact and probably would have survived the incident had rescue operations not been delayed . four passengers survived the incident in its entirety , meaning that they were alive when discharged from the hospital . . other crashes with death tolls of 200 or higher . 349 : on november 12 , 1996 , the charkhi dadri mid-air collision took place between saudia flight 763 and kazakhstan airlines flight 1907 over charkhi dadri , india . the collision was mainly the result of the kazakh pilot flying lower than the assigned clearance altitude . all 349 passengers and crew on board the two aircraft died . it remains the world 's deadliest mid-air collision . the ramesh chandra lahoti commission , empowered to study the causes , recommended the creation of the '' semi-circular rule '' , to prevent aircraft from flying in opposite directions at the same altitude . the civil aviation authorities in india made it mandatory for all aircraft flying in and out of india to be equipped with a traffic collision avoidance system ( tcas ) , setting a worldwide precedent for mandatory use of tcas . 346 : on march 3 , 1974 , turkish airlines flight 981 , a mcdonnell douglas dc-10 , crashed in a forest northeast of paris , france . the london-bound plane crashed shortly after taking off from orly airport ; all 346 people on board died . it was later determined that the cargo door detached , which caused an explosive decompression ; this caused the floor just above to collapse . the collapsed floor severed the control cables , which left the pilots without control of the elevators , the rudder and no . 2 engine . the plane entered a steep dive and crashed . it was the deadliest plane crash of all time until the tenerife disaster in 1977 . it is currently the deadliest single-aircraft crash with no survivors . 329 : on june 23 , 1985 , air india flight 182 , a boeing 747 en route from toronto and montreal to london and delhi , crashed off the southwest coast of ireland when a bomb exploded in the cargo hold . all 307 passengers and 22 crew members died . one passenger had checked in as '' m . singh '' . singh did not board the flight . his suitcase containing the bomb was loaded onto the plane , however . '' mr singh '' was never identified or captured . it was later determined sikh extremists were behind the bombing as a retaliation for the indian government 's attack on the golden temple in the city of amritsar , which is very important for the sikhs . this was , at the time , the deadliest terrorist attack involving an airplane . 301 : on august 19 , 1980 , saudi arabian airlines flight 163 , a lockheed l-1011 , became the world 's deadliest aviation accident that did not involve a crash . the crew performed an emergency landing at riyadh after a fire broke out in an aft baggage compartment . the fire burned through the ceiling of the compartment and into the passenger cabin . while the crew managed to land the plane safely , the captain did not stop immediately and order an evacuation . he taxied off the runway instead , by which time everyone in the cabin had become unconscious due to fumes and unable to open any doors or evacuate . all 301 passengers and crew died of suffocation before rescue ground crews could open any door , after which the aircraft burst into flames and was consumed by fire . 298 : on july 17 , 2014 , malaysia airlines flight 17 , a boeing 777-200er , flying from amsterdam to kuala lumpur with 298 people on board , was shot down in an area of eastern ukraine near the ukraine/russian border during the war in donbass . there were 283 passengers , including 3 infants , and 15 crew members on board mh17 , all of whom perished . the crew were all malaysians , while the passengers were of various nationalities , most from the netherlands . several ukrainian air force ( uaf ) list of ukrainian aircraft losses during the ukrainian crisis before the mh17 incident . immediately after the crash , a post appeared on the vkontakte social media profile attributed to igor girkin , leader of the donbass separatist militia , claiming responsibility for shooting down a ukrainian an-26 military transporter near torez . this post was removed later the same day , and the separatists then denied shooting down any aircraft . 290 : on july 3 , 1988 , iran air flight 655 , an iranian airbus a300 airliner , was shot down by two surface-to-air missiles from the u.s . navy guided missile cruiser uss vincennes over the strait of hormuz . all 290 passengers and crew aboard the aircraft died . 275 : on february 19 , 2003 , an iranian military ilyushin il-76 crashed in mountainous terrain near kerman in iran . the official report says bad weather brought the aircraft down ; high winds and fog were present at the time of the crash . 273 : on may 25 , 1979 , american airlines flight 191 , a mcdonnell douglas dc-10-10 , crashed shortly after lifting off the runway at chicago o'hare airport after the number one ( left ) engine and pylon separated from the wing . this broke hydraulic lines , causing leading edge lift devices to retract on that side of the aircraft and resulted in asymmetrical lift and loss of control . the accident was attributed to improper maintenance procedures . the crash resulted in the deaths of all 271 passengers and crew on board , as well as two people on the ground . it remains the deadliest commercial aircraft accident in united states history , and was also the country 's deadliest aviation disaster until the september 11 attacks in 2001 . 270 : on december 21 , 1988 , pan am flight 103 , a boeing 747-121 bound for new york–jfk from london–heathrow with continued service to detroit , was destroyed by a terrorist bomb over the town of lockerbie , scotland . all 243 passengers and 16 crew , and 11 people on the ground ( all residents of sherwood crescent , lockerbie ) , died , making it the worst terrorist attack involving an aircraft in the uk and the deadliest terrorist attack on british soil . following the crash , the federal aviation administration imposed new security measures on american airlines flying out of 103 airports in western europe and the middle east . 269 : on september 1 , 1983 , a soviet interceptor sukhoi su-15 shot down korean air lines flight 007 , a boeing 747 , bound for gimpo international airport in seoul , south korea , after it flew into soviet airspace ; all 269 passengers and crew on board died . 265 : on november 12 , 2001 , american airlines flight 587 , an airbus a300 , crashed in the belle harbor neighborhood of queens , new york , just after departing john f . kennedy international airport bound for las américas international airport , santo domingo . the first officer 's overuse of the rudder in response to wake turbulence from a japan airlines 747 was cited as cause . all 260 people on board , as well as five people on the ground , died from the crash . it is the second-deadliest aviation accident on u.s . soil , after american airlines flight 191 . 264 : on april 26 , 1994 , china airlines flight 140 was completing a routine flight and approach at nagoya airport , japan , when the airbus a300 's first officer inadvertently pressed the takeoff/go-around switch , which raises the throttle position to the same as take offs and go-arounds . the action and the two pilots ' reaction resulted in a crash that killed 264 ( 15 crew and 249 passengers ) of the 271 people aboard . 261 : on july 11 , 1991 , nigeria airways flight 2120 , a douglas dc-8-61 aircraft operated by nationair canada , crashed in jeddah , saudi arabia , after two tires ignited upon takeoff , leading to an in-flight fire . all 247 passengers and 14 crew members were killed . it is the deadliest aviation accident involving a dc-8 , the largest aviation disaster involving a canadian-registered aircraft and the second-worst accident in saudi arabia . 257 : on april 11 , 2018 , an algerian air force il-76 transport plane crashed shortly after take-off from boufarik airport , killing all 247 passengers and 10 crew on board . 257 : on november 28 , 1979 , air new zealand flight 901 , an antarctic sightseeing flight , collided with mount erebus on ross island , antarctica , killing all 237 passengers and 20 crew on board . the flight crew had not been informed that the computer coordinates for the flight path of the mcdonnell douglas dc-10 had been changed the night before , directing the flight directly into mount erebus rather than the usual path down mcmurdo sound . 256 : on december 12 , 1985 , a douglas dc-8 , arrow air flight 1285 , carrying american military personnel on a charter flight home for christmas , crashed in newfoundland ; all 248 passengers and 8 crew members died . the canadian aviation safety board investigating the cause of the crash issued two different reports : the majority report cited ice on the wings as cause of the crash ; the minority report suggests an explosion was the likely cause . 239 : on march 8 , 2014 , a boeing 777-200er , malaysia airlines flight 370 , flying from kuala lumpur , malaysia , to beijing , china , lost contact with air traffic controllers over the south china sea , deviated from its planned route , and was presumed lost in the southern indian ocean . it carried 12 malaysian crew members and 227 passengers from 15 nations , who are all presumed dead . a multinational search effort , the most extensive and expensive in aviation history , has thus far failed to locate the aircraft , though debris from the aircraft has been recovered from beaches around the indian ocean . numerous theories have been offered to explain the disappearance of the flight , but none has been confirmed . 234 : on september 26 , 1997 , an airbus a300b4-220 , garuda indonesia flight 152 , which departed from jakarta , indonesia , and was preparing to land at medan , north sumatra , crashed into mountainous terrain , killing 222 passengers and

boeing 747-131 , twa flight 800 , carrying 212 passengers and 18 crew , exploded and crashed into the atlantic ocean near east moriches , new york , shortly after departing from john f . kennedy international airport on a flight to paris and rome . a lengthy investigation concluded that the probable cause of the accident was a short circuit in a fuel tank that contained an explosive mixture of fuel vapor and air . as a result , new requirements were developed to prevent future fuel tank explosions in aircraft . 229 : on september 2 , 1998 , a mcdonnell douglas md-11 , swissair flight 111 , carrying 215 passengers and 14 crew from new york city to geneva , switzerland crashed into the atlantic ocean near halifax , nova scotia , canada , killing all aboard . after a lengthy investigation , an official report stated that flammable material used in the aircraft 's structure , specifically the personal tv systems recently installed in the business class cabin , allowed a fire to spread , resulting in a loss of control . 228 : on june 1 , 2009 , an airbus a330-203 , air france flight 447 , carrying 216 passengers and 12 crew , was en route from rio de janeiro , brazil to paris , france , when it crashed into the atlantic ocean . the aircraft 's flight recorders were not recovered from the ocean floor until may 2011 , and the final investigative report was released in july 2012 . it determined that the disaster was likely due to the aircraft 's pitot tubes being obstructed by ice crystals , causing the autopilot to disconnect . the crew reacted incorrectly , leading to an stall ( flight ) from which the jet did not recover . 228 : on august 6 , 1997 , a boeing 747-3b5 , korean air flight 801 , crashed on approach to the international airport in the united states territory of guam , killing 228 of the 254 people aboard . contributing factors in the crash were fatigue and errors by the flight crew , inadequate flight crew training , and a modification of the airport 's altitude warning system that prevented it from detecting aircraft below a minimum safe altitude . 227 : on january 8 , 1996 , an antonov an-32b aircraft with 6 crew members on board overshot the runway at n'dolo airport , kinshasa , democratic republic of congo , and plowed into a market place . four on board survived but 225 people on the ground were killed and an estimated 500

may 25 , 2002 , a boeing 747-209b , china airlines flight 611 , bound for hong kong international airport in hong kong , disintegrated in mid-air and crashed into the taiwan strait 20 minutes after takeoff from chiang kai-shek international airport ( now taiwan taoyuan international airport ) in taiwan . it was determined that the crash , which killed all 206 passengers and 19 crewmembers aboard the plane , was caused by improper repairs to the aircraft 22 years earlier when the aircraft encountered a tailstrike . 224 : on october 31 , 2015 , an airbus a321-231 , metrojet flight 9268 , crashed in the sinai peninsula after departing sharm el-sheikh international airport , egypt , en route to pulkovo airport , saint petersburg , russia . all 217 passengers and 7 crewmembers were

south of nantucket island , massachusetts , killing all 203 passengers and 14 crewmembers . the national transportation safety board determined that the probable cause of the crash was deliberate action by the relief first officer in response to his removal from international service within egyptair , a finding disputed by egyptian authorities who maintain another cause of the accident . 213 : on january 1 , 1978 , a boeing 747-237b , air india flight 855 , crashed into the arabian sea just off the coast of bombay , india , killing all 190 passengers and 23 crew on board . an investigation concluded that the captain became disoriented after the failure of one of the flight instruments in the cockpit , leading to '' irrational control inputs '' that caused the plane to crash . 203 : on

airport ) , taiwan , crashed into a road and residential neighborhood in taoyuan , taiwan , killing 182 passengers , 14 crew , and 7 people on the ground . an investigation determined that when the control tower ordered the pilot to abort his landing and '' go around '' for a second attempt , the pilot , who had unintentionally released the plane 's autopilot , did nothing to take control of the plane for 11 seconds as he apparently thought the autopilot would initiate the go around . as the aircraft approached the airport , the pilot executed a sudden steep ascent that produced a stall and crash . china airlines was also criticized for '' insufficient training . '' 200 : on july 10 , 1985 , a tupolev tu-154b-2 , aeroflot flight 7425 , on a domestic karshi–ufa–leningrad route , crashed near uchkuduk , uzbek ssr , soviet union , on the first leg of its route . all 191 passengers and 9 crew were killed . an investigation concluded that the plane went down due to pilot error . the air crew used an inappropriately low airspeed , causing vibrations that they incorrectly interpreted as engine surges . as a result , they further reduced engine power , causing the aircraft to stall and crash . safety . in over one hundred years of implementation , aviation safety has improved considerably . in modern times , two major manufacturers still produce heavy passenger aircraft for the civilian market : boeing in the united states , and the european company airbus . both of these manufacturers place a huge emphasis on the use of aviation safety equipment , now a billion-dollar industry in its own right ; safety is a key selling point for these companies , as they recognize that a poor safety record in the aviation industry is a threat to corporate survival . some major safety devices now required in commercial aircraft are : evacuation slides , to aid rapid passenger exit from an aircraft in an emergency situation advanced avionics , incorporating computerized auto-recovery and alert systems turbine engines with improved durability and failure containment mechanisms landing gear that can be lowered even after loss of power and hydraulics measured on a passenger-distance calculation , air travel is the safest form of transportation available : figures mentioned are the ones shared by the air industry when quoting air safety statistics . a typical statement , e.g . , by the bbc : '' uk airline operations are among the safest anywhere . when compared to all other modes of transport , on a 'fatality per mile basis ' , air transport is the safest & nbsp ; — six times safer than traveling by car ; twice as safe as rail . '' when measured by fatalities per person transported , however , buses are the safest form of transportation . the number of air travel fatalities per person is surpassed only by bicycles and motorcycles . this statistic is used by the insurance industry when calculating insurance rates for air travel . for every billion kilometers traveled , trains have a fatality rate that is 12 times higher than that of air travel , and the fatality rate for automobiles is 62 times greater than for air travel . by contrast , for every billion travel taken , buses are the safest form of transportation ; using this measure , air travel is three times more dangerous than car transportation , and almost 30 times more dangerous than travelling by bus . the website attributes the source as an october 2000 article by editor roger ford in the magazine modern railways and based on an unidentified detr survey . a 2007 study by popular mechanics magazine found that passengers sitting at the back of an airplane are 40 % more likely to survive a crash than those sitting at the front . the article quotes boeing , the faa , and a website on aircraft safety , all of which claim that there is no '' safest '' seat . the study examined 20 crashes , not taking into account the developments in safety after those accidents . however , a flight data recorder is usually mounted in the aircraft 's empennage ( tail section ) where it is more likely to survive a severe crash . between 1983 and 2000 , the survival rate for people in u.s . plane crashes was greater than 95 & nbsp ; per cent . . global aeronautical distress and safety system . in an effort to prevent incidents such as the disappearance of malaysia airlines flight mh370 , a new standard has been issued requiring all commercial aircraft to report their position every 15 & nbsp ; minutes to air traffic controllers regardless of the country of origin . introduced in 2016 by the icao , the regulation has no initial requirement for any new aircraft equipment to be fitted . the standard is part of a long-term plan , called the global aeronautical distress and safety system ( gadss ) , which will require new aircraft to be equipped with data broadcast systems that are in constant contact with air traffic controllers . the gadss is similar to the global maritime distress and safety system ( gmdss ) used for maritime safety . . aviation safety reporting system . the aviation safety reporting system ( asrs ) collects voluntarily submitted aviation safety incident/situation reports from pilots , controllers and others . the asrs uses reports to identify system deficiencies , issue alert messages , and produce two publications , callback , and asrs directline . the collected information is made available to the public , and is used by the faa , nasa and other organizations working in research and flight safety . . statistics . bureau of aircraft accidents archives ( b3a ) . the bureau of aircraft accidents archives ( b3a ) , a non-government organization based in geneva , compiles statistics on aviation accidents of aircraft capable of carrying more than six passengers , excluding helicopters , balloons , and combat aircraft . note that acro only considers crashes in which the aircraft has suffered such damage that it is removed from service , which will further reduce the statistics for incidents and fatalities compared to some other data . the total fatalities due to aviation accidents since 1970 is 83,772 . the total number of incidents is 11,164 . according to acro , recent years have been considerably safer for aviation , with fewer than 170 incidents every year between 2009 and 2017 , compared to as many as 226 as recently as 1998 . annual fatalities have been less than 1,000 in nine of the fourteen years since 2004 , with 2017 experiencing the lowest number of fatalities , at 399 , since the end of world war ii . 2014 included the mh370 over the indian ocean and the mh17 as part of the war in donbass . the total number of fatalities in 2014 was 869 more than in 2013 . deaths and incidents per year according to acro and bureau of aircraft accident archives data , : airbus industrie . commercial aviation accidents , 1958–2014 : a statistical analysis . blagnac cedex , france : airbus , 2015 13p . bordoni , antonio . airlife 's register of aircraft accidents : facts , statistics and analysis of civil accidents since 1951 . shrewsbury : airlife , 1997 401p . s a cullen md frcpath fraes .
