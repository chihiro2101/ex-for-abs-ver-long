John Dickson Carr

other works . besides dr . fell and sir henry merrivale , carr mysteries feature two other series detectives : henri bencolin and colonel march . a few of his novels do not feature a series detective . the most famous of these , the burning court ( 1937 ) , involves witchcraft , poisoning , and a body that disappears from a sealed crypt in suburban philadelphia ; it was the basis for the french movie la chambre ardente ( 1962 ) . carr wrote in the short story format as well . julian symons , in bloody murder : from the detective story to the crime novel : a history ( 1972 ) , said : '' most of carr 's stories are compressed versions of his locked-room novels , and at times they benefit from the compression . probably the best of them are in the carter dickson book , the department of queer complaints ( 1940 ) , although this does not include the brilliantly clever h.m . story the house in goblin wood or a successful pastiche which introduces edgar allan poe as a detective . '' julian symons , bloody murder : from the detective story to the crime novel : a history , first published faber and faber 1972 , with revisions penguin 1974 , during 1950 , carr wrote the novel , the bride of newgate , set during 1815 at the close of the napoleonic wars , '' one of the earliest historical mystery novels . '' the devil in velvet and fire , burn ! are the two historical novels ( involving also time travel ) with which he said he himself was most pleased . with adrian conan doyle , the youngest son of arthur conan doyle , carr wrote sherlock holmes stories that were published in the 1954 collection the exploits of sherlock holmes . he was also honored by the estate of sir arthur conan doyle by being asked to write the biography for the legendary author . the book , the life of sir arthur conan doyle , was published during 1949 and received generally favorable reviews for its vigor and entertaining style . critical appraisal . dr . fell has generally been considered to be carr 's major creation . the british novelist kingsley amis , for instance , writes in his essay , '' my favorite sleuths '' , that dr . fell is one of the three great successors to sherlock holmes ( the other two are father brown and nero wolfe ) and that h.m . , '' according to me is an old bore . '' this may be in part because in the merrivale novels written after world war ii , h.m . frequently became a comic caricature of himself , especially in the physical misadventures in which he found himself at least once in every novel . humorous as these episodes were intended to be , they also tended to have the effect of decreasing the mystique of the character . earlier , however , h.m . had been regarded more favorably by a number of critics . howard haycraft , author of the seminal murder for pleasure : the life and times of the detective story , wrote during 1941 that h.m . or '' the old man '' was '' the present writer 's admitted favorite among contemporary fictional sleuths '' . during 1938 the british mystery writer r . philmore wrote in an article called '' inquest on detective stories '' that sir henry was '' the most amusing of detectives '' . and further : '' of course , h.m . is so much the best detective that , once having invented him , his creator could get away with any plot . '' there is a book-length critical study by s . t . joshi , john dickson carr : a critical study ( 1990 ) and a chapter on carr in joshi 's book varieties of crime fiction ( 2019 ) . the definitive biography of carr is by douglas g . greene , john dickson carr : the man who explained miracles ( 1995 ) . from an obituary published in greenville , south carolina , carr allegedly also published using the name of fenton carter , but no works by anyone of this name have yet been identified . radio plays . carr also wrote many radio scripts , particularly for the suspense radio anthology series in america and for its uk equivalent appointment with fear introduced by valentine dyall , as well as many other dramas for the bbc , and some screenplays . his 1943 half-hour radio play cabin b-13 was expanded into a series on cbs during 1948 & ndash ; 49 for which carr wrote all 25 scripts , basing some on earlier works or re-presenting devices that chesterton had used . the 1943 play cabin b-13 was also expanded into the script for the 1953 movie dangerous crossing , directed by joseph m . newman and featuring michael rennie and jeanne crain . carr worked extensively for bbc during world war ii , writing both mystery stories and propaganda scripts . during the late 1940s he hosted murder by experts transmitted by mutual radio . he introduced works by other mystery writers who were the week 's guest writers . the show originated from mutual 's main station wor in new york city . many of these shows are available for free listening or downloading at the internet archive . film and television . carr 's works were the basis for several movies , including the man with a cloak ( 1951 ) and dangerous crossing ( 1953 ) . the emperor 's snuffbox was filmed as that woman opposite ( 1957 ) , and la chambre ardente ( 1962 ) was a loose adaptation of the burning court . various carr stories formed the basis for episodes of television series , particularly those without recurring characters such as general motors presents . during 1956 , the television series colonel march of scotland yard , featuring boris karloff as colonel march , was based on carr 's character and his stories and was broadcast for 26 episodes . publications . henri bencolin . it walks by night & ndash ;
