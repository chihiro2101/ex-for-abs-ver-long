Athlon 64

background . the athlon 64 was originally codenamed clawhammer by amd , and was referred to as such internally and in press releases . the first athlon 64 fx was based on the first opteron core , sledgehammer . both cores , produced on a 130 nanometer process , were first introduced on september 23 , 2003 . the models first available were the fx-51 , fitting socket 940 , and the 3200+ , fitting socket 754 . like the opteron , on which it was based , the athlon fx-51 required buffered ram , increasing the final cost of an upgrade . the week of the athlon 64 's launch , intel released the pentium 4 extreme edition , a cpu designed to compete with the athlon 64 fx . the extreme edition was widely considered a marketing ploy to draw publicity away from amd , and was quickly nicknamed among some circles the '' emergency edition '' . despite a very strong demand for the chip , amd experienced early manufacturing difficulties that made it difficult to deliver athlon 64s in quantity . in the early months of the athlon 64 lifespan , amd could only produce 100,000 chips per month . however , it was very competitive in terms of performance to the pentium 4 , with magazine pc world calling it the '' fastest yet '' . '' newcastle '' was released soon after clawhammer , with half the level 2 cache . . single-core athlon 64 . all the 64-bit processors sold by amd so far have their genesis in the k8 or hammer project . on june 1 , 2004 , amd released new versions of both the clawhammer and newcastle core revisions for the newly introduced socket 939 , an altered socket 940 without the need for buffered memory . socket 939 offered two main improvements over socket 754 : the memory controller was altered with dual-channel architecture , doubling peak memory bandwidth , and the hypertransport bus was increased in speed from 800 & nbsp ; mhz to 1000 & nbsp ; mhz . socket 939 also was introduced in the fx series in the form of the fx-55 . at the same time , amd also began to ship the '' winchester '' core , based on a 90 nanometer process . core revisions '' venice '' and '' san diego '' succeeded all previous revisions on april 15 , 2005 . venice , the lower-end part , was produced for both sockets 754 and 939 , and included 512 & nbsp ; kb of l2 cache . san diego , the higher-end chip , was produced only for socket 939 and doubled venice 's l2 cache to 1 & nbsp ; mb . both were produced on the 90 & nbsp ; nm fabrication process . both also included support for the sse3 instruction set , a new feature that had been included in the rival pentium 4 since the release of the prescott core in february 2004 . in addition , amd overhauled the memory controller for this revision , resulting in performance improvements as well as support for newer ddr ram . . dual-core athlon 64 . on april 21 , 2005 , less than a week after the release of venice and san diego , amd announced its next addition to the athlon 64 line , the athlon 64 x2 . released on may 31 , 2005 , it also initially had two different core revisions available to the public , manchester and toledo , the only appreciable difference between them being the amount of l2 cache . both were released only for socket 939 . the athlon 64 x2 was received very well by reviewers and the general public , with a general consensus emerging that amd 's implementation of multi-core was superior to that of the competing pentium d . some felt initially that the x2 would cause market confusion with regard to price points since the new processor was targeted at the same '' enthusiast , '' us 350 and above market already occupied by amd 's existing socket 939 athlon 64s . amd 's official breakdown of the chips placed the athlon x2 aimed at a segment they called the '' prosumer '' , along with digital media fans . the athlon 64 was targeted at the mainstream consumer , and the athlon fx at gamers . the sempron budget processor was targeted at value-conscious consumers . following the launch of the athlon 64 x2 , amd surpassed intel in us retail sales for a period of time , although intel retained overall market leadership because of its exclusive relationships with direct sellers such as dell . . ddr2 . the athlon 64 had been maligned by some critics for some time because of its lack of support for ddr2 sdram , an emerging technology that had been adopted much earlier by intel . amd 's official position was that the cas latency on ddr2 had not progressed to a point where it would be advantageous for the consumer to adopt it . amd finally remedied this gap with the '' orleans '' core revision , the first athlon 64 to fit socket am2 , released on may 23 , 2006 . '' windsor '' , an athlon 64 x2 revision for socket am2 , was released concurrently . both orleans and windsor have either 512 kb or 1 mb of l2 cache per core . the athlon 64 fx-62 was also released concurrently on the socket am2 platform . socket am2 also consumes less power than previous platforms , and supports amd-v . the memory controller used in all ddr2 sdram capable processors ( socket am2 ) , has extended column address range of 11 columns instead of conventional 10 columns , and the support of 16 kb page size , with at most 2048 individual entries supported . an ocz unbuffered ddr2 kit , optimized for 64-bit operating systems , was released to exploit the functionality provided by the memory controller in socket am2 processors , allowing the memory controller to stay longer on the same page , thus benefitting graphics intensive applications . . moving to the subnotebook space . the athlon architecture was further extended with the release of athlon neo processors on january 9 , 2009 . based on the same architecture as the other athlon 64 variants , the new processor features a small package footprint targeting subnotebook market . in simpler terms , the memory is always running at a set fraction of the cpu speed , with the divisor being a whole number . a 'fsb ' figure is still used to determine the cpu speed , but the ram speed is no longer directly related to this 'fsb ' figure ( known otherwise as the ldt ) . a second bus , the northbridge , connected the cpu to the chipset and device attachment bus ( pcie , agp , pci ) . this was implemented using a new high-performance standard , hypertransport . amd attempted , with some success , to make this an industry standard . it was also useful in building multi-processor systems without additional glue chips . translation lookaside buffers . translation lookaside buffers ( tlbs ) have also been enlarged ( 40 4k/2m/4m entries in l1 cache , 512 4k entries ) , with reduced latencies and improved branch predictor , with four times the number of bimodal counters in the global history counter . this and other architectural enhancements , especially as regards sse implementation , improve instruction per cycle ( ipc ) performance over the previous athlon xp generation . to make this easier for consumers to understand , amd has chosen to market the athlon 64 using a pr ( performance rating ) system , where the numbers roughly map to pentium 4 performance equivalents , rather than actual clock speed . . cool ' n'quiet . athlon 64 also features cpu speed throttling technology branded cool ' n'quiet , a feature similar to intel 's speedstep that can throttle the processor 's clock speed back to facilitate lower power consumption and heat production . when the user is running undemanding applications and the load on the processor is light , the processor 's clock speed and voltage are reduced . this in turn reduces its peak power consumption ( max tdp set at 89 w by amd ) to as low as 32 w ( stepping c0 , clock speed reduced to 800 & nbsp ; mhz ) or 22w ( stepping cg , clock speed reduced to 1 & nbsp ; ghz ) . the athlon 64 also has an integrated heat spreader ( ihs ) which prevents the cpu die from accidentally being damaged when mounting and unmounting heat sinks . with prior amd cpus a cpu shim could be used by people worried about damaging the die . nx bit . the nx bit supported by windows xp service pack 2 and future versions of windows , linux 2.6.8 and higher and freebsd 5.3 and higher is also included , for improved protection from malicious buffer overflow security threats . hardware-set permission levels make it much more difficult for malicious code to take control of the system . it is intended to make 64-bit computing a more secure environment . semiconductor technology . the athlon 64 cpus have been produced with 130 & nbsp ; nm and 90 & nbsp ; nm soi process technologies . all of the latest chips ( winchester , venice and san diego models ) are on 90 & nbsp ; nm . the venice and san diego models also incorporate dual stress liner technology ( an amalgam of strained silicon and 'squeezed silicon ' , the latter of which is not actually a technology ) co-developed with ibm . . processor cores . athlon 64 fx . the athlon 64 fx is positioned as a hardware enthusiast product , marketed by amd especially toward gamers . unlike the standard athlon 64 , all of the athlon 64 fx processors have their multipliers completely unlocked . starting with the fx-60 , the fx line became dual-core . the fx always has the highest clock speed of all athlons at its release . from fx-70 onwards , the line of processors will also support dual-processor setup with numa , named amd quad fx platform . athlon 64 x2 . the athlon 64 x2 is the first dual-core desktop cpu manufactured by amd . in 2007 , amd released two final athlon 64 x2 versions : the amd athlon 64 x2 6400+ and 5000+ black editions . both processors feature an unlocked multiplier , which allows for a large range of overclocked settings . the 6400+ is based on a 90 & nbsp ; nm windsor core ( 3.2 & nbsp ; ghz , 2x1mb l2 , 125w tdp ) while the 5000+ is based on a 65 & nbsp ; nm brisbane core ( 2.6 & nbsp ; ghz , 2x512kb l2 , 65w tdp ) . these black edition processors are available at retail , but amd does not include heatsinks in the retail package . turion 64 ( formerly mobile athlon 64 ) . thumb thumb previously introduced as '' mobile athlon 64 '' , turion 64 is now the brand name amd applies to its 64-bit low-power consumption ( mobile ) processors . the turion 64 and turion 64 x2 processors compete with intel 's mobile processors , initially the pentium m and later the intel core and intel core 2 processors . earlier turion 64 processors are compatible with amd 's socket 754 . the newer '' richmond '' models are designed for amd 's socket s1 . they are equipped with 512 or 1024 & nbsp ; kb of l2 cache , a 64-bit single channel on-die memory controller , and an 800 & nbsp ; mhz hypertransport bus . battery saving features , like powernow ! , are central to the marketing and usefulness of these cpus . model naming methodology . the model naming scheme does not make it obvious how to compare one turion with another , or even an athlon 64 . the model name is two letters , a dash , and a two digit number ( for example , ml-34 ) . the two letters together designate a processor class , while the number represents a pr rating . the first letter is m for single core processors and t for dual core turion 64 x2 processors . the later in the alphabet that the second letter appears , the more the model has been designed for mobility ( frugal power consumption ) . take for instance , an mt-30 and an ml-34 . since the t in the mt-30 is later in the alphabet than the l in ml-34 , the mt-30 consumes less power than the ml-34 . but since 34 is greater than 30 , the ml-34 is faster than the mt-30 . athlon neo . with 27 & nbsp ; mm × 27 & nbsp ; mm in size and 2.5 & nbsp ; mm in thickness , the athlon neo processors utilize a new package called '' asb1 '' , essentially a bga package , for smaller footprint to allow smaller designs for notebooks and lowering the cost . the clock of the processors is significantly lower than desktop and other mobile counterparts to reach a low tdp , at 15w maximum for a single core x86-64 cpu at 1.6 & nbsp ; ghz . the athlon neo processors are equipped with 512 kb of l2 cache and hypertransport 1.0 running at 800 & nbsp ; mhz frequency . sockets . socket 754 : the athlon 64 value/budget line , 64-bit memory interface ( single-channel ) socket 939 : athlon 64 performance line , athlon 64 x2s , and newer athlon 64 fxs , opteron , 128-bit memory interface ( dual-channel ) socket 940 : opteron and old athlon 64 fx , 128-bit memory interface - requires registered ddr memory socket am2 : athlon 64/athlon 64 fx/athlon 64 x2/sempron , 940 pins ( not compatible with socket 940 ) ; the first amd socket to use ddr2 sdram . socket f : opteron , 1207 pins socket f ( 1207 fx ) : athlon 64 fx on amd quad fx platform , also compatible for dual-processor opteron 2200 series at the introduction of athlon 64 in september 2003 , only socket 754 and socket 940 ( opteron ) were ready and available . the onboard memory controller was not capable of running unbuffered ( non-registered ) memory in dual-channel mode at the time of release ; as a stopgap measure , they introduced the athlon 64 on socket 754 , and brought out a non-multiprocessor version of the opteron called the athlon 64 fx , as a multiplier unlocked enthusiast part for socket 940 , comparable to intel 's pentium 4 extreme edition for the high end market . in june 2004 , amd released socket 939 as the mainstream athlon 64 with dual-channel memory interface , leaving socket 940 solely for the server market ( opterons ) , and relegating socket 754 as a value/budget line , for semprons and slower versions of the athlon 64 . eventually socket 754 replaced socket a for semprons . in may 2006 , amd released socket am2 , which provided support for the ddr2 memory interface . also , this marked the release of amd-v . in august 2006 , amd released socket f for opteron server cpu which uses the lga chip form factor . in november 2006 , amd released a specialized version of socket f , called 1207 fx , for dual-socket , dual-core athlon fx processors on the quad fx platform . while socket f opterons already allowed for four processor cores , quad fx allowed unbuffered ram and expanded cpu/chipset configuration in the bios . consequentially , socket f and f 1207 fx are incompatible and require different processors , chipsets , and motherboards . features table . cpu features table . athlon 64 fx models . sledgehammer ( 130 & nbsp ;
