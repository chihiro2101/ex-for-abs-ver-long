Milton Babbitt

biography . babbitt was born in philadelphia to albert e . babbitt and sarah potamkin . he was jewish . he was raised in jackson , mississippi , and began studying the violin when he was four but soon switched to clarinet and saxophone . early in his life he was attracted to jazz and theater music , and '' played in every pit-orchestra that came to town '' . babbitt was making his own arrangements of popular songs by age 7 , '' wrote a lot of pop tunes for school productions '' , and won a local songwriting contest when he was 13 . babbitt 's father was a mathematician , and babbitt intended to study mathematics when he entered the university of pennsylvania in 1931 . but he soon transferred to new york university , where he studied music with philip james and marion bauer . there he became interested in the music of the composers of the second viennese school and wrote articles on twelve-tone music , including the first description of combinatoriality and a serial '' time-point '' technique . after receiving his bachelor of arts degree from new york university college of arts & science in 1935 with phi beta kappa honors , he studied under roger sessions , first privately and then at princeton university . he joined princeton 's music faculty in 1938 and received one of princeton 's first master of fine arts degrees in 1942 . during the second world war , babbitt divided his time between mathematical research in washington , d.c . , and princeton , where he was a member of the mathematics faculty from 1943 to 1945 . in 1948 , babbitt returned to princeton 's music faculty and in 1973 he joined the faculty of the juilliard school . among his more notable students are music theorists david lewin and john rahn , composers bruce adolphe , michael dellaira , kenneth fuchs , laura karpman , paul lansky , donald martino , john melby , kenneth lampl , tobias picker , and j . k . randall , the theatre composer stephen sondheim , composers and pianists frederic rzewski and richard aaker trythall , and the jazz guitarist and composer stanley jordan . in 1958 , babbitt achieved unsought notoriety through an article in the popular magazine high fidelity . his title for the article was '' the composer as specialist '' ( as it was later published several times , including in , but , he said , '' the editor , without my knowledge and—therefore—my consent or assent , replaced my title by the more 'provocative ' one : 'who cares if you listen ? ' , a title which reflects little of the letter and nothing of the spirit of the article '' . more than 30 years later , he said , '' for all that the true source of that offensively vulgar title has been revealed many times , in many ways , even—eventually—by the offending journal itself , i still am far more likely to be known as the author of 'who cares if you listen ? ' than as the composer of music to which you may or may not care to listen '' . around 1960 , babbitt became interested in electronic music . rca hired him as consultant composer to work with its rca mark ii synthesizer at the columbia-princeton electronic music center ( known since 1996 as the columbia university computer music center ) . in 1961 he produced his composition for synthesizer , marking the beginning of a second period in his output . babbitt was less interested in producing new timbres than in the rhythmic precision he could achieve with the synthesizer , a degree of precision previously unobtainable in performance . through the 1960s and 1970s babbitt wrote both electronic music and music for conventional musical instruments , often combining the two . philomel ( 1964 ) , for example , is for soprano and a synthesized accompaniment ( including the recorded and manipulated voice of bethany beardslee , for whom the piece was composed ) stored on magnetic tape . by the end of the 1970s babbitt was beginning his third creative period by shifting his focus away from electronic music , the genre that first gained for him public notice . like most dodecaphonic music , babbitt 's compositions are typically considered atonal , but it has also been shown that , especially in his third-period music , notes from his serial structures ( all-partition arrays and superarrays ) are sometimes arranged and coordinated to forge tonal chords , cadential phrases , simulated tonal voice-leading , and other tonal allusions , allowing for double meaning ( serial and tonal ) , like many of his composition titles . this phenomenon of '' double meaning '' of notes ( pitches ) in the context of his double-meaning titles has been called portmantonality . from 1985 until his death babbitt served as the chairman of the bmi student composer awards , the international competition for young classical composers . a resident of princeton , new jersey , he died there on january 29 , 2011 , at age 94 . honors and awards . 1965 – member of the american academy of arts and letters 1974 – fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences 1982 – pulitzer prize , special citation , '' for his life 's work as a distinguished and seminal american composer '' 1986 – macarthur fellow 1988 – mississippi institute of arts and letters award for music composition 2000 – national patron of delta omicron , an international , professional music fraternity 2010 – the max reger foundation of america – extraordinary life time musical achievement award . articles .
