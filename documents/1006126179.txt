Falconry

history . evidence suggests that the art of falconry may have begun in mesopotamia , with the earliest accounts dating to around 2,000 bc . also , some raptor representations are in the northern altai , western mongolia . the falcon was a symbolic bird of ancient mongol tribes . some disagreement exists about whether such early accounts document the practice of falconry ( from the epic of gilgamesh and others ) or are misinterpreted depictions of humans with birds of prey . . . during the turkic period of central asia ( seventh century ad ) , concrete figures of falconers on horseback were described on the rocks in kyrgyz . falconry was probably introduced to europe around ad 400 , when the huns and alans invaded from the east . frederick ii of hohenstaufen ( 1194–1250 ) is generally acknowledged as the most significant wellspring of traditional falconry knowledge . he is believed to have obtained firsthand knowledge of arabic falconry during wars in the region ( between june 1228 and june 1229 ) . he obtained a copy of moamyn 's manual on falconry and had it translated into latin by theodore of antioch . frederick ii himself made corrections to the translation in 1241 , resulting in de scientia venandi per aves . . king frederick ii is most recognized for his falconry treatise , de arte venandi cum avibus ( the art of hunting with birds ) . written himself toward the end of his life , it is widely accepted as the first comprehensive book of falconry , but also notable in its contributions to ornithology and zoology . de arte venandi cum avibus incorporated a diversity of scholarly traditions from east to west , and is one of the earliest challenges to aristotle 's explanations of nature . . historically , falconry was a popular sport and status symbol among the nobles of medieval europe , the middle east , and mongolian empire . many historical illustrations left in rashid al din 's '' compendium chronicles '' book described falconry of the middle centuries with mongol images . falconry was largely restricted to the noble classes due to the prerequisite commitment of time , money , and space . in art and other aspects of culture , such as literature , falconry remained a status symbol long after it was no longer popularly practiced . the historical significance of falconry within lower social classes may be underrepresented in the archaeological record , due to a lack of surviving evidence , especially from nonliterate nomadic and nonagrarian societies . within nomadic societies such as the bedouin , falconry was not practiced for recreation by noblemen . instead , falcons were trapped and hunted on small game during the winter to supplement a very limited diet . . in the uk and parts of europe , falconry probably reached its zenith in the 17th century , but soon faded , particularly in the late 18th and 19th centuries , as firearms became the tool of choice for hunting . ( this likely took place throughout europe and asia in differing degrees . ) falconry in the uk had a resurgence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when a number of falconry books were published . . 291 pp . this revival led to the introduction of falconry in north america in the early 20th century . colonel r . luff meredith is recognized as the father of north american falconry . . throughout the 20th century , modern veterinary practices and the advent of radio telemetry ( transmitters attached to free-flying birds ) increased the average lifespan of falconry birds , and allowed falconers to pursue quarry and styles of flight that had previously resulted in the loss of their hawk or falcon . timeline . 722–705 bc – an assyrian bas-relief found in the ruins at khorsabad during the excavation of the palace of sargon ii ( sargon ii ) has been claimed to depict falconry . in fact , it depicts an archer shooting at raptors and an attendant capturing a raptor . a . h . layard 's statement in his 1853 book discoveries in the ruins of nineveh and babylon is '' a falconer bearing a hawk on his wrist appeared to be represented in a bas-relief which i saw on my last visit to those ruins .
