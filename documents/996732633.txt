kb instruction cache , from which up to 16 bytes are fetched on each cycle and sent to the instruction decoders . there are three instruction decoders . the decoders are not equal in capability : only one can decode any x86 instruction , while the other two can only decode simple x86 instructions . this restricts the pentium pro 's ability to decode multiple instructions simultaneously , limiting superscalar execution . x86 instructions are decoded into 118-bit micro-operations ( micro-ops ) . the micro-ops are risc-like ; that is , they encode an operation , two sources , and a destination . the general decoder can generate up to four micro-ops per cycle , whereas the simple decoders can generate one micro-op each per cycle . thus , x86 instructions that operate on the memory ( e.g . , add this register to this location in the memory ) can only be processed by the general decoder , as this operation requires a minimum of three micro-ops . likewise , the simple decoders are limited to instructions that can be translated into one micro-op . instructions that require more micro-ops than four are translated with the assistance of a sequencer , which generates the required micro-ops over multiple clock cycles . the pentium pro was the first processor in the x86-family to support upgradeable microcode under bios and/or operating system control . micro-ops exit the re-order buffer ( rob ) and enter a reserve station ( rs ) , where they await dispatch to the execution units . in each clock cycle , up to five micro-ops can be dispatched to five execution units . the pentium pro has a total of six execution units : two integer units , one floating-point unit ( fpu ) , a load unit , store address unit , and a store data unit . one of the integer units shares the same ports as the fpu , and therefore the pentium pro can only dispatch one integer micro-op and one floating-point micro-op , or two integer micro-ops per a cycle , in addition to micro-ops for the other three execution units . of the two integer units , only the one that shares the path with the fpu on port 0 has the full complement of functions such as a barrel shifter , multiplier , divider , and support for lea instructions . the second integer unit , which is connected to port 1 , does not have these facilities and is limited to simple operations such as add , subtract , and the calculation of branch target addresses . the fpu executes floating-point operations . addition and multiplication are pipelined and have a latency of three and five cycles , respectively . division and square-root are not pipelined and are executed in separate units that share the fpu 's ports . division and square root have a latency of 18-36 and 29-69 cycles , respectively . the smallest number is for single precision ( 32-bit ) floating-point numbers and the largest for extended precision ( 80-bit ) numbers . division and square root can operate simultaneously with adds and multiplies , preventing them from executing only when the result has to be stored in the rob . after the microprocessor was released , a bug was discovered in the floating point unit , commonly called the '' pentium pro and pentium ii fpu bug '' and by intel as the '' flag erratum '' . the bug occurs under some circumstances during floating point-to-integer conversion when the floating point number wo n't fit into the smaller integer format , causing the fpu to deviate from its documented behaviour . the bug is considered to be minor and occurs under such special circumstances that very few , if any , software programs are affected . the pentium pro p6 microarchitecture was used in one form or another by intel for more than a decade . the pipeline would scale from its initial 150 & nbsp ; mhz start , all the way up to 1.4 & nbsp ; ghz with the '' tualatin '' pentium iii . the design 's various traits would continue after that in the derivative core called '' banias '' in pentium m and intel core ( yonah ) , which itself would evolve into the core microarchitecture ( core 2 processor ) in 2006 and onward . . instruction set . the pentium pro ( p6 ) introduced new instructions into the intel range ; the cmovxx ( ‘ conditional move ’ ) instructions can move a value that is either the contents of a register or memory location into another register or not , according to some predicate logical condition xx on the flags register , xx being a flags predicate code as given in the condition for conditional jump instructions . so for example cmovne moves a specified value into a register or not depending on whether the ne ( not-equal ) condition is true in the flags register ie z flag 0 . this allows the evaluation of if-then-else operations and for example the ? : operation in c . these instructions give a performance boost by allowing the avoidance of costly jump and branch instructions . in eg cmovxx destreg1 , source_operand2 the first operand is the destination register , the second the source register or memory location . the second operand unfortunately can not be an immediate ( in-line constant ) value and such a constant would have to be placed in a register first . the predicate code xx can take the full range of values as allowed in conditional branches . a second development was the documentation of the ud2 illegal instruction . this op code is reserved and guaranteed to cause an illegal instruction exception on the p6 and all later processors . this allows developers to easily crash the current program in a future-proof fashion when a bug is detected by software . performance . despite being advanced for the time , the pentium pro 's out-of-order register renaming architecture had trouble with running 16-bit code and mixed code ( 8/16-bit or 16/32-bit ) , as using partial registers cause frequent pipeline flushing . specific use of partial registers was a common performance optimization in the day , as it incurred no performance penalty on pre-p6 intel processors ; also , the dominant operating systems at the time of the pentium pro 's release were 16-bit dos and the mixed 16/32-bit windows 3.1x and windows 95 ( although the latter requires a 32-bit 80386 cpu , much of its code is still 16-bit for performance reasons , such as user.exe ) . this , together with the high cost of pentium pro systems , caused rather lackluster reception among pc enthusiasts at the time . to take full advantage of the pentium pro 's p6 microarchitecture , a fully 32-bit os is needed , such as windows nt , linux , unix , or os/2 . the performance issues on legacy code were later partially mitigated by intel with the pentium ii . compared to risc microprocessors , the pentium pro , when introduced , slightly outperformed the fastest risc microprocessors on integer performance when running the specint95 benchmark , but floating-point performance was significantly lower , half of some risc microprocessors . the pentium pro 's integer performance lead disappeared rapidly , first overtaken by the mips technologies r10000 in january 1996 , and then by digital equipment corporation 's ev56 variant of the alpha 21164 . gwennap , linley ( 1996-07-08 ) . '' digital 's 21164 reaches 500 mhz '' . microprocessor report . reviewers quickly noted the very slow writes to video memory as the weak spot of the p6 platform , with performance here being as low as 10 % of an identically clocked pentium system in benchmarks such as vidspeed . methods to circumvent this included setting vesa drawing to system memory instead of video memory in games such as quake , and later on utilities such as fastvid emerged , which could double performance in certain games by enabling the write combining features of the cpu . mtrrs are set automatically by windows video drivers starting from ~1997 , and there the improved cache/memory subsystem and fpu performance caused it to outclass the pentium clock-for-clock in the emerging 3d games of the mid–to–late 1990s , particularly when using nt4 . however , its lack of mmx implementation reduces performance in multimedia applications that made use of those instructions . caching . likely pentium pro 's most noticeable addition was its on-package l2 cache , which ranged from 256 & nbsp ; kb at introduction to 1 & nbsp ; mb in 1997 . at the time , manufacturing technology did not feasibly allow a large l2 cache to be integrated into the processor core . intel instead placed the l2 die ( s ) separately in the package which still allowed it to run at the same clock speed as the cpu core . additionally , unlike most motherboard-based cache schemes that shared the main system bus with the cpu , the pentium pro 's cache had its own back-side bus ( called dual independent bus by intel ) . because of this , the cpu could read main memory and cache concurrently , greatly reducing a traditional bottleneck . the cache was also '' non-blocking '' , meaning that the processor could issue more than one cache request at a time ( up to 4 ) , reducing cache-miss penalties . ( this is an example of mlp , memory level parallelism . ) these properties combined to produce an l2 cache that was immensely faster than the motherboard-based caches of older processors . this cache alone gave the cpu an advantage in input/output performance over older x86 cpus . in multiprocessor configurations , pentium pro 's integrated cache skyrocketed performance in comparison to architectures which had each cpu sharing a central cache . however , this far faster l2 cache did come with some complications . the pentium pro 's '' on-package cache '' arrangement was unique . the processor and the cache were on separate dies in the same package and connected closely by a full-speed bus . the two or three dies had to be bonded together early in the production process , before testing was possible . this meant that a single , tiny flaw in either die made it necessary to discard the entire assembly , which was one of the reasons for the pentium pro 's relatively low production yield and high cost . all versions of the chip were expensive , those with 1024 & nbsp ; kb being particularly so , since it required two 512 & nbsp ; kb cache dies as well as the processor die . available models . pentium pro clock speeds were 150 , 166 , 180 or 200 & nbsp ; mhz with a 60 or 66 & nbsp ; mhz external bus clock . some users chose to overclock their pentium pro chips , with the 200 & nbsp ; mhz version often being run at 233 & nbsp ; mhz , the 180 & nbsp ; mhz version often being run at 200 & nbsp ; mhz , and the 150 & nbsp ; mhz version often being run at 166 & nbsp ; mhz . the chip was popular in symmetric multiprocessing configurations , with dual and quad smp server and workstation setups being commonplace . in intel 's '' family/model/stepping '' scheme , the pentium pro is family 6 , model 1 , and its intel product code is 80521 . fabrication . the process used to fabricate the pentium pro processor die and its separate cache memory die changed , leading to a combination of processes used in the same package : the 133 & nbsp ; mhz pentium pro prototype processor die was fabricated in a 0.6 & nbsp ; μm bicmos process . papworth , david b .

'' tuning the pentium pro microarchitecture '' . ieee micro , pp . 14–15 . the 150 & nbsp ; mhz pentium pro processor die was fabricated in a 0.50 & nbsp ; μm bicmos process . the 166 , 180 , and 200 & nbsp ; mhz pentium pro processor die was fabricated in a 0.35 & nbsp ; μm bicmos process . the 256 & nbsp ; kb l2 cache die was fabricated in a 0.50 & nbsp ; μm bicmos process . the 512 and 1024 & nbsp ; kb l2 cache die was fabricated in a 0.35 & nbsp ; μm bicmos process . . packaging . the pentium pro ( up to 512 & nbsp ; kb cache ) is packaged in a ceramic multi-chip module ( mcm ) . the mcm contains two underside cavities in which the microprocessor die and its companion cache die reside . the dies are bonded to a heat slug , whose exposed top helps the heat from the dies to be transferred more directly to cooling apparatus such as a heat sink . the dies are connected to the package using conventional wire bonding . the cavities are capped with a ceramic plate . the pentium pro with 1 & nbsp ; mb of cache uses a plastic mcm . instead of two cavities , there is only one , in which the three dies reside , bonded to the package instead of a heat slug . the cavities are filled in with epoxy . the mcm has 387 & nbsp ; pins , of which approximately half are arranged in a pin grid array ( pga ) and half in an interstitial pin grid array ( ipga ) . the packaging was designed for socket 8 . upgrade paths . in 1998 , the 300/333 & nbsp ; mhz pentium ii overdrive processor for socket & nbsp ; 8 was released . featuring 512 & nbsp ; kb of full-speed cache , it was produced by intel as a drop-in upgrade option for owners of pentium pro systems . however , it only supported two-way glueless multiprocessing , not four-way or higher , which did not make it a usable upgrade for quad-processor systems . these specially packaged pentium ii xeon processors were used to upgrade asci red , which became the first computer to reach the teraflops performance mark with the pentium pro processor and then the first to exceed 2 teraflops after the upgrade to pentium ii xeon processors . as slot 1 motherboards became prevalent , several manufacturers released slocket adapters , such as the tyan m2020 , asus c-p6s1 , tekram p6sl1 , and the abit kp6 . the slockets allowed pentium pro processors to be used with slot & nbsp ; 1 motherboards . the intel 440fx chipset explicitly supported both pentium pro and pentium & nbsp ; ii processors , but the intel 440bx and later slot & nbsp ; 1 chipsets did not explicitly support the pentium pro , so the socket & nbsp ; 8 slockets did not see wide use . slockets—in the form of socket 370 to slot & nbsp ; 1 adapters—saw renewed popularity when intel introduced socket & nbsp ; 370 celeron and pentium iii processors . core specifications . pentium pro . l1 cache : 8 , 8 & nbsp ;
