Scapegoating

at the individual level . a medical definition of scapegoating is : scapegoated groups throughout history have included almost every imaginable group of people : genders , religions , people of different races , nations , or sexual orientations , people with different political beliefs , or people differing in behaviour from the majority . however , scapegoating may also be applied to organizations , such as governments , corporations , or various political groups . its archetype . jungian analyst sylvia brinton perera situates its mythology of shadow and guilt . perera , the scapegoat complex ( 1986 ) . individuals experience it at the archetypal level . as an ancient social process to rid a community of its past evil deeds and reconnect it to the sacred realm , the scapegoat appeared in a biblical rite , acharei mot , per the holy day of yom kippur . which involved two goats and the pre-judaic , chthonic god azazel . perera ( 1986 ) , p.17 : the hebrews '' later considered azazel a fallen angel '' . perera at p.112 n.28 , citing to louis ginzberg . in the modern scapegoat complex , however , '' the energy field has been radically broken apart '' and the libido '' split off from consciousness '' . azazel 's role is deformed into an accuser of the scapegoated victim . perera ( 1986 ) , p.18 ( two quotes re modern secular culture , azazel 's role debased ) . blame for breaking a perfectionist moral code , for instance , might be measured out by aggressive scapegoaters . themselves often wounded , the scapegoaters can be sadistic , superego accusers with brittle personas , who have driven their own shadows underground from where such are projected onto the victim . the scapegoated victim may then live in a hell of felt unworthiness , retreating from consciousness , burdened by shadow and transpersonal guilt , cf . c . g . jung , '' a psychological view of conscience '' in his collected works ( princeton : bollingen 1953–1979 ) , vol . 10 , cited by perera ( 1986 ) , re pp . 11–12 n.8 , 14 n.21 , 33 n.45 . and hiding from the pain of self-understanding . therapy includes modeling self-protective skills for the victim 's battered ego , and guidance in the search for inner integrity , to find the victim 's own voice . perera ( 1986 ) : archetype ( pp . 9–10 , 16 , 18 , 48–49 , 73 , 77 , 83 , 98 ) ; ancient rite ( pp . 8 , 11–25 , two goats 16–17 , 88–97 ) ; modern complex ( 18–29 , 30 , 98 , quotes at 18 ) ; accusers ( 9 , 18–21 , blames victim 20 , superego 21 , 28–29 , 30–33 , shadow 30 , projected 31 , also wounded 32 , 55 ) ; victims ( 11–12 , 15–16 , hiding 24 , 26–28 , hell 26 , ego 28 , 33 , 34–35 , 43–72 , burden 98 ) ; within families ( 30–33 , 35 , 53–54 , 73 , 76 , 99 ) ; therapy ( 18 , 22 , 24–25 , 26–29 , voice 29 , 33 , 41–43 , 47 , 69–72 , 86–97 ) . . projection . unwanted thoughts and feelings can be unconsciously projected onto another who becomes a scapegoat for one 's own problems . this concept can be extended to projection by groups . in this case the chosen individual , or group , becomes the scapegoat for the group 's problems . '' political agitation in all countries is full of such projections , just as much as the backyard gossip of little groups and individuals . '' m.-l . von franz , in c . g . jung , man and his symbols ( london 1964 ) p . 181 swiss psychiatrist carl jung considered indeed that '' there must be some people who behave in the wrong way ; they act as scapegoats and objects of interest for the normal ones '' . c . g jung , analytical psychology ( london 1976 ) p . 108 . scapegoat theory of intergroup conflict . the scapegoat theory of intergroup conflict provides an explanation for the correlation between times of relative economic despair and increases in prejudice and violence toward outgroups . studies of anti-black violence ( racist violence ) in the southern united states between 1882 and 1930 show a correlation between poor economic conditions and outbreaks of violence ( e.g . , lynchings ) against blacks . the correlation between the price of cotton ( the principal product of the area at that time ) and the number of lynchings of black men by whites ranged from −0.63 to −0.72 , suggesting that a poor economy induced white people to take out their frustrations by attacking an outgroup . scapegoating as a group necessitates that ingroup members settle on one specific target to blame for their problems . scapegoating is also more likely to appear when a group has experienced difficult , prolonged negative experiences ( as opposed to minor annoyances ) . when negative conditions frustrate a group 's attempts at successful acquisition of its most essential needs ( e.g . , food , shelter ) , groups develop a compelling , shared ideology that – when combined with social and political pressures – may lead to the most extreme form of scapegoating : genocide . scapegoating can also cause oppressed groups to lash out at other oppressed groups . even when injustices are committed against a minority group by the majority group , minorities sometimes lash out against a different minority group in lieu of confronting the more powerful majority . scapegoating has been noted after terrorist attacks and political assassinations ; such as anti-arabism backlash against arabs in america after september 11th , 2001 , or the retaliations against the sikhs in the wake of the assassination of indira gandhi in india . in management , scapegoating is a known practice in which a lower staff employee is blamed for the mistakes of senior executives . this is often due to lack of accountability in upper management . the art of scapegoating in it projects pm hut , 15 october 2009 . scapegoat mechanism . literary critic and philosopher kenneth burke first coined and described the expression scapegoat mechanism in his books permanence and change ( 1935 ) , and a grammar of motives ( 1945 ) . these works influenced some philosophical anthropology , such as ernest becker and rené girard . girard developed the concept much more extensively as an interpretation of human culture . in girard 's view , it is humankind , not god , who has need for various forms of atoning violence . humans are driven by desire for that which another has or wants ( mimetic desire ) . this causes a triangulation of desire and results in conflict between the desiring parties . this mimetic contagion increases to a point where society is at risk ; it is at this point that the scapegoat mechanism mimesis – the scapegoat model , jean-baptiste dumont is triggered . this is the point where one person is singled out as the cause of the trouble and is expelled or killed by the group . this person is the scapegoat . social order is restored as people are contented that they have solved the cause of their problems by removing the scapegoated individual , and the cycle begins again . the keyword here is '' content '' . scapegoating serves as a psychological relief for a group of people . girard contends that this is what happened in the narrative of jesus of nazareth , the central figure in christianity . the difference between the scapegoating of jesus and others , girard believes , is that in the resurrection of jesus from the dead , he is shown to be an innocent victim ; humanity is thus made aware of its violent tendencies and the cycle is broken . thus girard 's work is significant as a reconstruction of the christus victor atonement theory . see also . references . further reading . books . colman , a.d . up from scapegoating : awakening consciousness in groups ( 1995 ) douglas , tom scapegoats : transferring blame ( 1995 ) dyckman , jm & cutler ja scapegoats at work : taking the bull's-eye off your back ( 2003 ) rené girard : violence and the sacred ( 1972 ) girard , rené : the scapegoat ( 1986 ) jasinski , james : '' sourcebook on rhetoric '' ( 2001 ) sylvia brinton perera , the scapegoat complex : toward a mythology of shadow and guilt ( toronto : inner city 1986 ) , studies in jungian psychology by jungian analysts pillari v scapegoating in families : intergenerational patterns of physical and emotional abuse ( 1991 ) quarmby k scapegoat : why we are failing disabled people ( 2011 ) wilcox c.w . scapegoat : targeted for blame ( 2009 ) zemel , joel : scapegoat , the extraordinary legal proceedings following the 1917 halifax explosion ( 2012 ) . academic articles . . reference books .
