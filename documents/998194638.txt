but these synthetics were too stable and not nutritionally viable . if the mineral was taken from the edta ligand , the ligand could not be used by the body and would be expelled . during the expulsion process the edta ligand randomly chelated and stripped another mineral from the body . according to the association of american feed control officials ( aafco ) , a metal–amino acid chelate is defined as the product resulting from the reaction of metal ions from a soluble metal salt with amino acids , with a mole ratio in the range of 1–3 ( preferably 2 ) moles of amino acids for one mole of metal . the average weight of the hydrolyzed amino acids must be approximately 150 and the resulting molecular weight of the chelate must not exceed 800 da . since the early development of these compounds , much more research has been conducted , and has been applied to human nutrition products in a similar manner to the animal nutrition experiments that pioneered the technology . ferrous bis-glycinate is an example of one of these compounds that has been developed for human nutrition . . dental and oral application . first-generation dentin adhesives were first designed and produced in the 1950s . these systems were based on a co-monomer chelate with calcium on the surface of the tooth and generated very weak water resistant chemical bonding ( 2–3 mpa ) . . heavy-metal detoxification . chelation therapy is an antidote for poisoning by mercury , arsenic , and lead . chelating agents convert these metal ions into a chemically and biochemically inert form that can be excreted . chelation using calcium disodium edta has been approved by the u.s . food and drug administration ( fda ) for serious cases of lead poisoning . it is not approved for treating '' heavy metal toxicity '' . although beneficial in cases of serious lead poisoning , use of disodium edta ( edetate disodium ) instead of calcium disodium edta has resulted in fatalities due to hypocalcemia . disodium edta is not approved by the fda for any use , and all fda-approved chelation therapy products require a prescription . . pharmaceuticals . chelate complexes of gadolinium are often used as contrast agents in mris , although iron particle and manganese chelate complexes have also been explored . bifunctional chelate complexes of zirconium , gallium , fluorine , copper , yttrium , bromine , or iodine are often used for conjugation to monoclonal antibodies for use in antibody-based pet imaging . these chelate complexes often employ the usage of hexadentate ligands such as desferrioxamine b ( dfo ) , according to meijs et al . , and the gadolinium complexes often employ the usage of octadentate ligands such as dtpa , according to desreux et al . auranofin , a chelate complex of gold , is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , and penicillamine , which forms chelate complexes of copper , is used in the treatment of wilson 's disease and cystinuria , as well as refractory rheumatoid arthritis . . other medical applications . chelation in the intestinal tract is a cause of numerous interactions between drugs and metal ions ( also known as '' minerals '' in nutrition ) . as examples , antibiotic drugs of the tetracycline and quinolone families are chelators of fe 2+ , ca 2+ , and mg 2+ ions . edta , which binds to calcium , is used to alleviate the hypercalcemia that often results from band keratopathy . the calcium may then be removed from the cornea , allowing for some increase in clarity of vision for the patient . industrial and agricultural applications . catalysis . homogeneous catalysts are often chelated complexes . a representative example is the use of binap ( a bidentate phosphine ) in noyori asymmetric hydrogenation and asymmetric isomerization . the latter has the practical use of manufacture of synthetic menthol . water softening . citric acid is used to soften water in soaps and laundry detergents . a common synthetic chelator is edta . phosphonates are also well-known chelating agents . chelators are used in water treatment programs and specifically in steam engineering , e.g . , boiler water treatment system : chelant water treatment system . although the treatment is often referred to as '' softening , '' chelation has little effect on the water 's mineral content , other than to make it soluble and lower the water 's ph level . fertilizers . metal chelate compounds are common components of fertilizers to provide micronutrients . these micronutrients ( manganese , iron , zinc , copper ) are required for the health of the plants . most fertilizers contain phosphate salts that , in the absence of chelating agents , typically convert these metal ions into insoluble solids that are of no nutritional value to the plants . edta is the typical chelating agent that keeps these metal ions in a soluble form . . etymology . the word chelation is derived from greek χηλή , chēlē , meaning '' claw '' ; the ligands lie around the central atom like the claws of a lobster . the term chelate was first applied in 1920 by sir gilbert t . morgan and h . d . k . drew , who stated : '' the adjective chelate , derived from the great claw or chele ( greek ) of the lobster or other crustaceans , is suggested for the caliperlike groups which function as two associating units and fasten to the central atom so as to produce heterocyclic rings .
