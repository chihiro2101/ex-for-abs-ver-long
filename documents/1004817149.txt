time the town was mentioned by a contemporary writer was in 1130 . according to snorri sturluson , tønsberg was founded before the battle of hafrsfjord , which , according to snorri , took place in 871 . what year the battle took place is disputed , however , and most current historians believe the battle took place closer to 900 . however , if the battle did in fact take place in 871 , this would make tønsberg one of the oldest present scandinavian cities . it was based upon this that the city 's 1000 years jubilee was celebrated in 1871 , and 1100 years jubilee in 1971 . the archaeological excavations conducted in 1987–88 underneath the monastery ruins revealed several viking graves which have served to confirm the earlier age of the original settlement . the king or his ombudsman resided in the old royal court at sæheimr , today the jarlsberg manor ( jarlsberg hovedgård ) , and on the farm haugar , ( from the old norse word haugr meaning hill or burial mound ) , which can be assumed to have been tønsberg 's birthplace . haugar became the seat for the haugating , the thing for vestfold and norway 's second most important place for the proclamation of kings . the site had probably been named after two viking era mounds , which tradition links to two sons of king harald i , olaf haraldsson geirstadalf , who was king in vestfold og telemark , and his half-brother , sigrød haraldsson , king of trondheim . both are presumed to have fallen in battle at haugar against their half-brother eric bloodaxe and to have been buried on the same spot . slottsfjellet ( castle mountain ) , north of the city centre , made for a near impregnable natural fortress . during the civil war era of the 12th century , it was fortified by the baglers . the birkebeiners besieged it for 20 weeks in the winter of 1201 before the baglers surrendered . in the 13th century , king haakon haakonson set up a castle in tønsberg , tønsberg fortress . the town was destroyed by fire in 1536 , but tønsberg remained one of the most important harbour towns in norway . james vi of scotland stopped in tønsberg on his way to meet anne of denmark in oslo , and david lindsay gave a sermon on 16 november 1589 . the event was recorded by a painted inscription in the church , which survives in the museum . david stevenson , scotland 's last royal wedding ( edinburgh

henrik henriksen of tønsberg . elliot , gerald ( 1998 ) . a whaling enterprise : salvesen in the antarctic . michael russell . page 18 . henrik johan bull was another famous whaler from the district , famous for his expeditions to antarctica . bull traveled from australia to tønsberg in order to learn from local whaler svend foyn , who is recognized as the pioneer of the modern whaling industry . riffenburgh , beau ( 2007 ) . encyclopedia of the antarctic , volume 1 . taylor & francis . page 677 . one of the city 's most prominent residents , svend foyn , was a pioneer who embarked on an 1847 expedition to the arctic , which led to a catch of 6,000 seals . soon tønsberg harbor was home to a large fleet of sealing vessels , and the sealing industry grew further after the 1849 repeal of britain 's navigation acts . the hunters turned the seals to near extinction in the arctic ocean , and therefore turned to bottle-nosed whales during the 1870s . norway maintained a monopoly on european whaling until 1883 , first and foremost due to svend foyn 's patent rights to whaling techniques and inventions . over-hunting in the arctic eventually drove the whalers to antarctica . by the beginning of the 20th century , tønsberg had lost its preeminence in the whaling industry to the neighboring city of sandefjord . tønnessen , johan nicolay and arne odd johnsen ( 1982 ) . the
