Barnaby (comics)

characters and story . one night after having been read a fairy tale involving a fairy godmother by his mother , barnaby baxter was totally surprised to receive a visit through his bedroom window by the cigar-wielding and pink wings-wearing jackeen j . ( j . j . ) o'malley , who announced that he was barnaby 's fairy godfather . from that moment on , barnaby began a series of adventures with mr . o'malley that frequently got the pair of them into a fair number of scrapes . however , most of them were either of mr . o'malley 's making or resulted in embarrassment of some sort for the rather clumsy fairy godfather , a member of the elves , leprechauns , gnomes , and little men 's chowder & marching society . however , quite a number of their adventures had surprising results ( such as uncovering a gang of criminals hiding their loot in a supposedly haunted house , barnaby 's winning a scrap iron contest while out searching for a leprechaun 's pot of gold , and unmasking a spy working in mr . baxter 's office ) . barnaby 's parents denied that mr . o'malley was real and took barnaby to a number of child psychologists . this denial continued even when o'malley was seen flying past their picture window , when he walked into their living room , and even after o'malley was elected their representative to congress . as time passed , more characters were added , including : jane schultz , the little girl from down the street who originally did n't believe in mr . o'malley until she was face to face with him ( although her parents , like barnaby 's , did n't believe her ) ; gorgon , barnaby 's talking dog ( who never talked in front of the adults ) ; gus the timid and glasses-wearing ghost , atlas the mental giant ( who was physically barnaby 's size ) ; and lancelot mcsnoyd , the annoying invisible leprechaun who spoke in a brooklyn accent . the strip ended when barnaby finally reached his sixth birthday , the magical point beyond which he could no longer have a fairy godfather . with much regret , o'malley left , and so ( after a short-lived attempt in the 1960s to revive the strip by redoing the original stories ) did johnson , to pursue other interests . history . barnaby was primarily a daily strip which began april 20 , 1942 and later had a short-lived sunday strip ( december 1 , 1946 to may 30 , 1948 ) . instead of hand-lettering , barnaby used typography in the balloons . the typeface is futura ( typeface ) , which was designed by the german typographer paul renner in the 1920s . in 1946 , when johnson began to concentrate on his children 's books , the strip was drawn by johnson 's connecticut neighbor , artist jack morley , who had previously drawn editorial cartoons for the new york journal american . for a year , morley collaborated on the writing of the strip with ted ferro , who teamed with his wife for nine years on their scripts for the daytime comedy-drama radio serial , lorenzo jones . the morley/ferro strips ran from december 31 , 1945 to september 14 , 1947 . starting september 14 , 1947 , johnson began scripting again , with morley doing the art . johnson assisted morley by giving him specific layouts for each panel , and the credit '' jack morley and cj '' was then used on the strip . the final story reached a conclusion on february 2 , 1952 . . revival and reprints . the strip was briefly revived , with adaptations of the early stories minus their world war ii references , for a run from september 12 , 1960 to april 14 , 1962 . these strips were redrawn in johnson 's style by warren sattler . norwood , rick . comics revue k-state.edu barnaby received much critical praise when it first appeared , and it has been reprinted in barnaby quarterly ( three issues , 1940s ) , by henry holt and company ( two hardcover books , with strips redrawn ) , dover books ( reprinting the first hardcover , 1960s ) , ballantine books ( six paperbacks , 1980s ) and in comics revue magazine . these reprints still command high prices from used book dealers . fantagraphics books has begun publishing a five-volume series of collections designed by daniel clowes , reprinting the entire original run ( 1942-1952 ) of the strip . the first volume became available in june 2013 . while the series was originally estimated to complete in 2017 , the fourth volume was not published until december 2020 . . theater . jerome chodorov wrote a 1946 stage adaptation , barnaby and mr . o'malley , produced by barney josephson . it ran in several east coast cities , drawing attention with a scene in which o'malley ( j . m . kerrigan ) flew over the audience tossing out leaflets urging support for his run for congress . barnaby was portrayed by thomas wm . hamilton , who later had the minor planet 4897 tomhamilton named after him . iris mann played jane , and royal dano had the role of the leprechaun launcelot mcsnoyd . the play was later adapted for television as a 1959 episode of the general electric theater , hosted by ronald reagan and starring bert lahr and ron howard . . bibliography . key : q1–q3 barnaby quarterly ;
