Eye

overview . complex eyes can distinguish shapes and colours . the visual fields of many organisms , especially predators , involve large areas of binocular vision to improve depth perception . in other organisms , eyes are located so as to maximise the field of view , such as in rabbits and horses , which have monocular vision . the first proto-eyes evolved among animals about the time of the cambrian explosion . the last common ancestor of animals possessed the biochemical toolkit necessary for vision , and more advanced eyes have evolved in 96 % of animal species in six of the ~35 main phyla . in most vertebrates and some molluscs , the eye works by allowing light to enter and project onto a light-sensitive layer of cells at the end of the eye , known as the retina . the cone cells ( for colour ) and the rod cells ( for low-light contrasts ) in the retina detect and convert light into neural signals for vision . the visual signals are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve . such eyes are typically roughly spherical , filled with a transparent gel-like substance called the vitreous humour , with a focusing lens and often an iris ; the relaxing or tightening of the muscles around the iris change the size of the pupil , thereby regulating the amount of light that enters the eye , and reducing aberrations when there is enough light . the eyes of most cephalopods , fish , amphibians and snakes have fixed lens shapes , and focusing vision is achieved by telescoping the lens—similar to how a camera focuses . biomedia associates educational biology site : what animal has a more sophisticated eye , octopus or insect ? compound eyes are found among the arthropods and are composed of many simple facets which , depending on the details of anatomy , may give either a single pixelated image or multiple images , per eye . each sensor has its own lens and photosensitive cell ( s ) . some eyes have up to 28,000 such sensors , which are arranged hexagonally , and which can give a full 360° field of vision . compound eyes are very sensitive to motion . some arthropods , including many strepsiptera , have compound eyes of only a few facets , each with a retina capable of creating an image , creating vision . with each eye viewing a different thing , a fused image from all the eyes is produced in the brain , providing very different , high-resolution images . possessing detailed hyperspectral colour vision , the mantis shrimp has been reported to have the world 's most complex colour vision system . trilobites , which are now extinct , had unique compound eyes . they used clear calcite crystals to form the lenses of their eyes . in this , they differ from most other arthropods , which have soft eyes . the number of lenses in such an eye varied ; however , some trilobites had only one , and some had thousands of lenses in one eye . in contrast to compound eyes , simple eyes are those that have a single lens . for example , jumping spiders have a large pair of simple eyes with a narrow field of view , supported by an array of other , smaller eyes for peripheral vision . some insect larvae , like caterpillars , have a different type of simple eye ( stemmata ) which usually provides only a rough image , but ( as in sawfly larvae ) can possess resolving powers of 4 degrees of arc , be polarization-sensitive and capable of increasing its absolute sensitivity at night by a factor of 1,000 or more . some of the simplest eyes , called ocelli , can be found in animals like some of the snails , which can not actually '' see '' in the normal sense . they do have photosensitive cells , but no lens and no other means of projecting an image onto these cells . they can distinguish between light and dark , but no more . this enables snails to keep out of direct sunlight . in organisms dwelling near deep-sea vents , compound eyes have been secondarily simplified and adapted to see the infrared produced by the hot vents—in this way the bearers can avoid being boiled alive . . types . there are ten different eye layouts—indeed every technological method of capturing an optical image commonly used by human beings , with the exceptions of zoom and fresnel lenses , occur in nature . eye types can be categorised into '' simple eyes '' , with one concave photoreceptive surface , and '' compound eyes '' , which comprise a number of individual lenses laid out on a convex surface . note that '' simple '' does not imply a reduced level of complexity or acuity . indeed , any eye type can be adapted for almost any behaviour or environment . the only limitations specific to eye types are that of resolution—the physics of compound eyes prevents them from achieving a resolution better than 1° . also , superposition eyes can achieve greater sensitivity than apposition eyes , so are better suited to dark-dwelling creatures . eyes also fall into two groups on the basis of their photoreceptor 's cellular construction , with the photoreceptor cells either being cilliated ( as in the vertebrates ) or rhabdomeric . these two groups are not monophyletic ; the cnidaria also possess cilliated cells , and some gastropods , as well as some annelids possess both . some organisms have photosensitive cells that do nothing but detect whether the surroundings are light or dark , which is sufficient for the entrainment of circadian rhythms . these are not considered eyes because they lack enough structure to be considered an organ , and do not produce an image . . non-compound eyes . simple eyes are rather ubiquitous , and lens-bearing eyes have evolved at least seven times in vertebrates , cephalopods , annelids , crustaceans and cubozoa . . pit eyes . pit eyes , also known as stemma , are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angles of light that enters and affects the eye-spot , to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light . found in about 85 % of phyla , these basic forms were probably the precursors to more advanced types of '' simple eyes '' . they are small , comprising up to about 100 cells covering about 100 & nbsp ; µm . the directionality can be improved by reducing the size of the aperture , by incorporating a reflective layer behind the receptor cells , or by filling the pit with a refractile material . crotalinae have developed pits that function as eyes by sensing thermal infra-red radiation , in addition to their optical wavelength eyes like those of other vertebrates ( see infrared sensing in snakes ) . however , pit organs are fitted with receptors rather different from photoreceptors , namely a specific transient receptor potential channel ( trp channels ) called trpv1 . the main difference is that photoreceptors are g protein-coupled receptor but trp are ion channels . spherical lens eye . the resolution of pit eyes can be greatly improved by incorporating a material with a higher refractive index to form a lens , which may greatly reduce the blur radius encountered—hence increasing the resolution obtainable . the most basic form , seen in some gastropods and annelids , consists of a lens of one refractive index . a far sharper image can be obtained using materials with a high refractive index , decreasing to the edges ; this decreases the focal length and thus allows a sharp image to form on the retina . this also allows a larger aperture for a given sharpness of image , allowing more light to enter the lens ; and a flatter lens , reducing spherical aberration . such a non-homogeneous lens is necessary for the focal length to drop from about 4 times the lens radius , to 2.5 radii . heterogeneous eyes have evolved at least nine times : four or more times in gastropods , once in the copepods , once in the annelids , once in the cephalopods , and once in the chitons , which have aragonite lenses . no extant aquatic organisms possess homogeneous lenses ; presumably the evolutionary pressure for a heterogeneous lens is great enough for this stage to be quickly '' outgrown '' . this eye creates an image that is sharp enough that motion of the eye can cause significant blurring . to minimise the effect of eye motion while the animal moves , most such eyes have stabilising eye muscles . the ocelli of insects bear a simple lens , but their focal point usually lies behind the retina ; consequently , those ca n't form a sharp image . ocelli ( pit-type eyes of arthropods ) blur the image across the whole retina , and are consequently excellent at responding to rapid changes in light intensity across the whole visual field ; this fast response is further accelerated by the large nerve bundles which rush the information to the brain . focusing the image would also cause the sun 's image to be focused on a few receptors , with the possibility of damage under the intense light ; shielding the receptors would block out some light and thus reduce their sensitivity . this fast response has led to suggestions that the ocelli of insects are used mainly in flight , because they can be used to detect sudden changes in which way is up ( because light , especially uv light which is absorbed by vegetation , usually comes from above ) . . multiple lenses . some marine organisms bear more than one lens ; for instance the copepod pontella has three . the outer has a parabolic surface , countering the effects of spherical aberration while allowing a sharp image to be formed . another copepod , copilia , has two lenses in each eye , arranged like those in a telescope . such arrangements are rare and poorly understood , but represent an alternative construction . multiple lenses are seen in some hunters such as eagles and jumping spiders , which have a refractive cornea : these have a negative lens , enlarging the observed image by up to 50 % over the receptor cells , thus increasing their optical resolution . . refractive cornea . in the mammalian eye , birds , reptiles , and most other terrestrial vertebrates ( along with spiders and some insect larvae ) the vitreous fluid has a higher refractive index than the air . in general , the lens is not spherical . spherical lenses produce spherical aberration . in refractive corneas , the lens tissue is corrected with inhomogeneous lens material ( see luneburg lens ) , or with an aspheric shape . flattening the lens has a disadvantage ; the quality of vision is diminished away from the main line of focus . thus , animals that have evolved with a wide field-of-view often have eyes that make use of an inhomogeneous lens . as mentioned above , a refractive cornea is only useful out of water . in water , there is little difference in refractive index between the vitreous fluid and the surrounding water . hence creatures that have returned to the water—penguins and seals , for example—lose their highly curved cornea and return to lens-based vision . an alternative solution , borne by some divers , is to have a very strongly focusing cornea . . reflector eyes . an alternative to a lens is to line the inside of the eye with '' mirrors '' , and reflect the image to focus at a central point . the nature of these eyes means that if one were to peer into the pupil of an eye , one would see the same image that the organism would see , reflected back out . many small organisms such as rotifers , copepods and flatworms use such organs , but these are too small to produce usable images . some larger organisms , such as scallops , also use reflector eyes . the scallop pecten has up to 100 millimetre-scale reflector eyes fringing the edge of its shell . it detects moving objects as they pass successive lenses . there is at least one vertebrate , the spookfish , whose eyes include reflective optics for focusing of light . each of the two eyes of a spookfish collects light from both above and below ; the light coming from above is focused by a lens , while that coming from below , by a curved mirror composed of many layers of small reflective plates made of guanine crystals . . compound eyes . a compound eye may consist of thousands of individual photoreceptor units or ommatidia ( ommatidium , singular ) . the image perceived is a combination of inputs from the numerous ommatidia ( individual '' eye units '' ) , which are located on a convex surface , thus pointing in slightly different directions . compared with simple eyes , compound eyes possess a very large view angle , and can detect fast movement and , in some cases , the polarisation of light . because the individual lenses are so small , the effects of diffraction impose a limit on the possible resolution that can be obtained ( assuming that they do not function as phased arrays ) . this can only be countered by increasing lens size and number . to see with a resolution comparable to our simple eyes , humans would require very large compound eyes , around in radius . compound eyes fall into two groups : apposition eyes , which form multiple inverted images , and superposition eyes , which form a single erect image . compound eyes are common in arthropods , annelids and some bivalved molluscs . compound eyes in arthropods grow at their margins by the addition of new ommatidia . . apposition eyes . apposition eyes are the most common form of eyes and are presumably the ancestral form of compound eyes . they are found in all arthropod groups , although they may have evolved more than once within this phylum . some annelids and bivalves also have apposition eyes . they are also possessed by limulus , the horseshoe crab , and there are suggestions that other chelicerates developed their simple eyes by reduction from a compound starting point . ( some caterpillars appear to have evolved compound eyes from simple eyes in the opposite fashion . ) apposition eyes work by gathering a number of images , one from each eye , and combining them in the brain , with each eye typically contributing a single point of information . the typical apposition eye has a lens focusing light from one direction on the rhabdom , while light from other directions is absorbed by the dark wall of the ommatidium . superposition eyes . the second type is named the superposition eye . the superposition eye is divided into three types : refracting , reflecting and parabolic superposition the refracting superposition eye has a gap between the lens and the rhabdom , and no side wall . each lens takes light at an angle to its axis and reflects it to the same angle on the other side . the result is an image at half the radius of the eye , which is where the tips of the rhabdoms are . this type of compound eye , for which a minimal size exists below which effective superposition can not occur , is normally found in nocturnal insects , because it can create images up to 1000 times brighter than equivalent apposition eyes , though at the cost of reduced resolution . in the parabolic superposition compound eye type , seen in arthropods such as mayfly , the parabolic surfaces of the inside of each facet focus light from a reflector to a sensor array . long-bodied decapoda such as shrimp , prawns , crayfish and lobsters are alone in having reflecting superposition eyes , which also have a transparent gap but use corner mirrors instead of lenses . parabolic superposition . this eye type functions by refracting light , then using a parabolic mirror to focus the image ; it combines features of superposition and apposition eyes . . other . another kind of compound eye , found in males of order strepsiptera , employs a series of simple eyes—eyes having one opening that provides light for an entire image-forming retina . several of these eyelets together form the strepsipteran compound eye , which is similar to the 'schizochroal ' compound eyes of some trilobites . because each eyelet is a simple eye , it produces an inverted image ; those images are combined in the brain to form one unified image . because the aperture of an eyelet is larger than the facets of a compound eye , this arrangement allows vision under low light levels . good fliers such as flies or honey bees , or prey-catching insects such as praying mantis or dragonfly , have specialised zones of ommatidia organised into a fovea area which gives acute vision . in the acute zone , the eyes are flattened and the facets larger . the flattening allows more ommatidia to receive light from a spot and therefore higher resolution . the black spot that can be seen on the compound eyes of such insects , which always seems to look directly at the observer , is called a pseudopupil . this occurs because the ommatidia which one observes '' head-on '' ( along their optical axis ) absorb the incident light , while those to one side reflect it . there are some exceptions from the types mentioned above . some insects have a so-called single lens compound eye , a transitional type which is something between a superposition type of the multi-lens compound eye and the single lens eye found in animals with simple eyes . then there is the mysid shrimp , dioptromysis paucispinosa . the shrimp has an eye of the refracting superposition type , in the rear behind this in each eye there is a single large facet that is three times in diameter the others in the eye and behind this is an enlarged crystalline cone . this projects an upright image on a specialised retina . the resulting eye is a mixture of a simple eye within a compound eye . another version is a compound eye often referred to as '' pseudofaceted '' , as seen in scutigera . this type of eye consists of a cluster of numerous ommatidia on each side of the head , organised in a way that resembles a true compound eye . the body of ophiocoma wendtii , a type of brittle star , is covered with ommatidia , turning its whole skin into a compound eye . the same is true of many chitons . the tube feet of sea urchins contain photoreceptor proteins , which together act as a compound eye ; they lack screening pigments , but can detect the directionality of light by the shadow cast by its opaque body . . nutrients . the ciliary body is triangular in horizontal section and is coated by a double layer , the ciliary epithelium . the inner layer is transparent and covers the vitreous body , and is continuous from the neural tissue of the retina . the outer layer is highly pigmented , continuous with the retinal pigment epithelium , and constitutes the cells of the dilator muscle . the vitreous is the transparent , colourless , gelatinous mass that fills the space between the lens of the eye and the retina lining the back of the eye . it is produced by certain retinal cells . it is of rather similar composition to the cornea , but contains very few cells ( mostly phagocytes which remove unwanted cellular debris in the visual field , as well as the hyalocytes of balazs of the surface of the vitreous , which reprocess the hyaluronic acid ) , no blood vessels , and 98–99 % of its volume is water ( as opposed to 75 % in the cornea ) with salts , sugars , vitrosin ( a type of collagen ) , a network of collagen type ii fibres with the mucopolysaccharide hyaluronic acid , and also a wide array of proteins in micro amounts . amazingly , with so little solid matter , it tautly holds the eye . evolution . photoreception is phylogenetics very old , with various theories of phylogenesis . the common origin ( monophyly ) of all animal eyes is now widely accepted as fact . this is based upon the shared genetic features of all eyes ; that is , all modern eyes , varied as they are , have their origins in a proto-eye believed to have evolved some 540 million years ago , and the pax6 gene is considered a key factor in this . the majority of the advancements in early eyes are believed to have taken only a few million years to develop , since the first predator to gain true imaging would have touched off an '' arms race '' conway-morris , s . ( 1998 ) . the crucible of creation . oxford : oxford university press among all species that did not flee the photopic environment . prey animals and competing predators alike would be at a distinct disadvantage without such capabilities and would be less likely to survive and reproduce . hence multiple eye types and subtypes developed in parallel ( except those of groups , such as the vertebrates , that were only forced into the photopic environment at a late stage ) . eyes in various animals show adaptation to their requirements . for example , the eye of a bird of prey has much greater visual acuity than a human eye , and in some cases can detect ultraviolet radiation . the different forms of eye in , for example , vertebrates and molluscs are examples of parallel evolution , despite their distant common ancestry . phenotypic convergence of the geometry of cephalopod and most vertebrate eyes creates the impression that the vertebrate eye evolved from an imaging cephalopod eye , but this is not the case , as the reversed roles of their respective ciliary and rhabdomeric opsin classes and different lens crystallins show . the very earliest '' eyes '' , called eye-spots , were simple patches of photoreceptor protein in unicellular animals . in multicellular beings , multicellular eyespots evolved , physically similar to the receptor patches for taste and smell . these eyespots could only sense ambient brightness : they could distinguish light and dark , but not the direction of the light source . through gradual change , the eye-spots of species living in well-lit environments depressed into a shallow '' cup '' shape . the ability to slightly discriminate directional brightness was achieved by using the angle at which the light hit certain cells to identify the source . the pit deepened over time , the opening diminished in size , and the number of photoreceptor cells increased , forming an effective pinhole camera that was capable of dimly distinguishing shapes . however , the ancestors of modern hagfish , thought to be the protovertebrate , were evidently pushed to very deep , dark waters , where they were less vulnerable to sighted predators , and where it is advantageous to have a convex eye-spot , which gathers more light than a flat or concave one . this would have led to a somewhat different evolutionary trajectory for the vertebrate eye than for other animal eyes . the thin overgrowth of transparent cells over the eye 's aperture , originally formed to prevent damage to the eyespot , allowed the segregated contents of the eye chamber to specialise into a transparent humour that optimised colour filtering , blocked harmful radiation , improved the eye 's refractive index , and allowed functionality outside of water . the transparent protective cells eventually split into two layers , with circulatory fluid in between that allowed wider viewing angles and greater imaging resolution , and the thickness of the transparent layer gradually increased , in most species with the transparent crystallin protein . fernald , russell d . ( 2001 ) . the evolution of eyes : where do lenses come from ? karger gazette 64 : '' the eye in focus '' . the gap between tissue layers naturally formed a biconvex shape , an optimally ideal structure for a normal refractive index . independently , a transparent layer and a nontransparent layer split forward from the lens : the cornea and iris . separation of the forward layer again formed a humour , the aqueous humour . this increased refractive power and again eased circulatory problems . formation of a nontransparent ring allowed more blood vessels , more circulation , and larger eye sizes . . relationship to life requirements . eyes are generally adapted to the environment and life requirements of the organism which bears them . for instance , the distribution of photoreceptors tends to match the area in which the highest acuity is required , with horizon-scanning organisms , such as those that live on the african plains , having a horizontal line of high-density ganglia , while tree-dwelling creatures which require good all-round vision tend to have a symmetrical distribution of ganglia , with acuity decreasing outwards from the centre . of course , for most eye types , it is impossible to diverge from a spherical form , so only the density of optical receptors can be altered . in organisms with compound eyes , it is the number of ommatidia rather than ganglia that reflects the region of highest data acquisition . optical superposition eyes are constrained to a spherical shape , but other forms of compound eyes may deform to a shape where more ommatidia are aligned to , say , the horizon , without altering the size or density of individual ommatidia . eyes of horizon-scanning organisms have stalks so they can be easily aligned to the horizon when this is inclined , for example , if the animal is on a slope . an extension of this concept is that the eyes of predators typically have a zone of very acute vision at their centre , to assist in the identification of prey . in deep water organisms , it may not be the centre of the eye that is enlarged . the hyperiid amphipods are deep water animals that feed on organisms above them . their eyes are almost divided into two , with the upper region thought to be involved in detecting the silhouettes of potential prey—or predators—against the faint light of the sky above . accordingly , deeper water hyperiids , where the light against which the silhouettes must be compared is dimmer , have larger '' upper-eyes '' , and may lose the lower portion of their eyes altogether . in the giant antarctic isopod glyptonotus a small ventral compound eye is physically completely separated from the much larger dorsal compound eye . depth perception can be enhanced by having eyes which are enlarged in one direction ; distorting the eye slightly allows the distance to the object to be estimated with a high degree of accuracy . acuity is higher among male organisms that mate in mid-air , as they need to be able to spot and assess potential mates against a very large backdrop . on the other hand , the eyes of organisms which operate in low light levels , such as around dawn and dusk or in deep water , tend to be larger to increase the amount of light that can be captured . it is not only the shape of the eye that may be affected by lifestyle . eyes can be the most visible parts of organisms , and this can act as a pressure on organisms to have more transparent eyes at the cost of function . eyes may be mounted on stalks to provide better all-round vision , by lifting them above an organism 's carapace ; this also allows them to track predators or prey without moving the head . . physiology . visual acuity . visual acuity , or resolving power , is '' the ability to distinguish fine detail '' and is the property of cone cells . it is often measured in cycles per degree ( cpd ) , which measures an angular resolution , or how much an eye can differentiate one object from another in terms of visual angles . resolution in cpd can be measured by bar charts of different numbers of white/black stripe cycles . for example , if each pattern is 1.75 & nbsp ; cm wide and is placed at 1 m distance from the eye , it will subtend an angle of 1 degree , so the number of white/black bar pairs on the pattern will be a measure of the cycles per degree of that pattern . the highest such number that the eye can resolve as stripes , or distinguish from a grey block , is then the measurement of visual acuity of the eye . for a human eye with excellent acuity , the maximum theoretical resolution is 50 cpd ( 1.2 arcminute per line pair , or a 0.35 & nbsp ; mm line pair , at 1 m ) . a rat can resolve only about 1 to 2 cpd . a horse has higher acuity through most of the visual field of its eyes than a human has , but does not match the high acuity of the human eye 's central fovea region . spherical aberration limits the resolution of a 7 & nbsp ; mm pupil to about 3 arcminutes per line pair . at a pupil diameter of 3 & nbsp ; mm , the spherical aberration is greatly reduced , resulting in an improved resolution of approximately 1.7 arcminutes per line pair . a resolution of 2 arcminutes per line pair , equivalent to a 1 arcminute gap in an optotype , corresponds to 20/20 ( normal vision ) in humans . however , in the compound eye , the resolution is related to the size of individual ommatidia and the distance between neighbouring ommatidia . physically these can not be reduced in size to achieve the acuity seen with single lensed eyes as in mammals . compound eyes have a much lower acuity than vertebrate eyes . . colour perception . '' colour vision is the faculty of the organism to distinguish lights of different spectral qualities . '' all organisms are restricted to a small range of electromagnetic spectrum ; this varies from creature to creature , but is mainly between wavelengths of 400 and 700 & nbsp ; nm . this is a rather small section of the electromagnetic spectrum , probably reflecting the submarine evolution of the organ : water blocks out all but two small windows of the em spectrum , and there has been no evolutionary pressure among land animals to broaden this range . the most sensitive pigment , rhodopsin , has a peak response at 500 & nbsp ; nm . small changes to the genes coding for this protein can tweak the peak response by a few nm ; pigments in the lens can also filter incoming light , changing the peak response . many organisms are unable to discriminate between colours , seeing instead in shades of grey ; colour vision necessitates a range of pigment cells which are primarily sensitive to smaller ranges of the spectrum . in primates , geckos , and other organisms , these take the form of cone cells , from which the more sensitive rod cells evolved . even if organisms are physically capable of discriminating different colours , this does not necessarily mean that they can perceive the different colours ; only with behavioural tests can this be deduced . most organisms with colour vision can detect ultraviolet light . this high energy light can be damaging to receptor cells . with a few exceptions ( snakes , placental mammals ) , most organisms avoid these effects by having absorbent oil droplets around their cone cells . the alternative , developed by organisms that had lost these oil droplets in the course of evolution , is to make the lens impervious to uv light—this precludes the possibility of any uv light being detected , as it does not even reach the retina . . rods and cones . the retina contains two major types of light-sensitive photoreceptor cells used for vision : the rods and the cones . rods can not distinguish colours , but are responsible for low-light ( scotopic ) monochrome ( black-and-white ) vision ; they work well in dim light as they contain a pigment , rhodopsin ( visual purple ) , which is sensitive at low light intensity , but saturates at higher ( photopic ) intensities . rods are distributed throughout the retina but there are none at the fovea and none at the blind spot . rod density is greater in the peripheral retina than in the central retina . cones are responsible for color vision . they require brighter light to function than rods require . in humans , there are three types of cones , maximally sensitive to long-wavelength , medium-wavelength , and short-wavelength light ( often referred to as red , green , and blue , respectively , though the sensitivity peaks are not actually at these colours ) . the colour seen is the combined effect of stimuli to , and responses from , these three types of cone cells . cones are mostly concentrated in and near the fovea . only a few are present at the sides of the retina . objects are seen most sharply in focus when their images fall on the fovea , as when one looks at an object directly . cone cells and rods are connected through intermediate cells in the retina to nerve fibres of the optic nerve . when rods and cones are stimulated by light , they connect through adjoining cells within the retina to send an electrical signal to the optic nerve fibres . the optic nerves send off impulses through these fibres to the brain . . pigmentation . the pigment molecules used in the eye are various , but can be used to define the evolutionary distance between different groups , and can also be an aid in determining which are closely related—although problems of convergence do exist . opsins are the pigments involved in photoreception . other pigments , such as melanin , are used to shield the photoreceptor cells from light leaking in from the sides . the opsin protein group evolved long before the last common ancestor of animals , and has continued to diversify since . there are two types of opsin involved in vision ; c-opsins , which are associated with ciliary-type photoreceptor cells , and r-opsins , associated with rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells . the eyes of vertebrates usually contain ciliary cells with c-opsins , and ( bilaterian ) invertebrates have rhabdomeric cells in the eye with r-opsins . however , some ganglion cells of vertebrates express r-opsins , suggesting that their ancestors used this pigment in vision , and that remnants survive in the eyes . likewise , c-opsins have been found to be expressed in the brain of some invertebrates . they may have been expressed in ciliary cells of larval eyes , which were subsequently resorbed into the brain on metamorphosis to the adult form . c-opsins are also found in some derived bilaterian-invertebrate eyes , such as the pallial eyes of the bivalve molluscs ; however , the lateral eyes ( which were presumably the ancestral type for this group , if eyes evolved once there ) always use r-opsins . cnidaria , which are an outgroup to the taxa mentioned above , express c-opsins—but r-opsins are yet to be found in this group . incidentally , the melanin produced in the cnidaria is produced in the same fashion as that in vertebrates , suggesting the common descent of this pigment . . additional images . file : three main layers of the eye.png the structures of the eye labelled file : three internal chambers of the eye.png another view of the eye and the structures of the eye labelled file : anatomy of eye.jpg thumb anatomy of the human eye created with wolfram language . see also . adaptation ( eye ) ( night vision ) emission theory ( vision ) eye color eye development eye disease eye injury eye movement eyelid nictitating membrane ophthalmology orbit ( anatomy ) simple eye in invertebrates tapetum lucidum tears . notes . references . citations . . bibliography . . further reading . . external links . evolution of the eye anatomy of the eye – flash animated interactive .
