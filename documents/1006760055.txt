Gray's Anatomy

publication history . origins . the english anatomist henry gray was born in 1827 . he studied the development of the endocrine glands and spleen and in 1853 was appointed lecturer on anatomy at st george 's hospital medical school in london . in 1855 , he approached his colleague henry vandyke carter with his idea to produce an inexpensive and accessible anatomy textbook for medical students . dissecting unclaimed bodies from workhouse and hospital mortuary through the anatomy act of 1832 , the two worked for 18 months on what would form the basis of the book . their work was first published in 1858 by john william parker in london . it was dedicated by gray to sir benjamin collins brodie , 1st baronet . an imprint of this english first edition was published in the united states in 1859 , with slight alterations . gray prepared a second , revised edition , which was published in the united kingdom in 1860 , also by j.w . parker . however , gray died the following year , at the age of & nbsp ; 34 , having contracted smallpox while treating his nephew ( who survived ) . his death had come just three years after the initial publication of his anatomy descriptive and surgical . even so , the work on his much-praised book was continued by others . longman 's publication reportedly began in 1863 , after their acquisition of the j.w . parker publishing business . this coincided with the publication date of the third british edition of gray 's anatomy . p . iv ( previous editions and editors – listings ) successive british editions of gray 's anatomy continued to be published under the longman , and more recently churchill livingstone/elsevier imprints , reflecting further changes in ownership of the publishing companies over the years . american editions . the full american rights were purchased by blanchard and lea , who published the first of twenty-five this count excludes the previously mentioned 1859 us publication of the english first edition . distinct american editions of gray 's anatomy in 1862 , and whose company became lea & febiger in 1908 . lea & febiger continued publishing the american editions until the company was sold in 1990 . lea & febiger in tredyffrin east town historical society history quarterly digital archives , pp . 68–70 ( source : april 1999 , vol . 37 , no . 2 , pp . 63–70 ) the first american publication was edited by richard james dunglison , whose father robley dunglison was physician to thomas jefferson . '' gray 's anatomy : the jefferson years '' in jeffline forum , september 2003 dunglison edited the next four editions . these were : the second american edition ( february 1862 ) ; the new third american from the fifth english edition ( may 1870 ) ; the new american from the eighth english edition ( july 1878 ) ; and the new american from the tenth english edition ( august 1883 ) . w . w . keen edited the next two editions , namely : the new american from the eleventh english edition ( september 1887 ) ; and the new american from the thirteenth english edition ( september 1893 ) . in september 1896 , reference to the english edition was dropped and it was published as the fourteenth edition , edited by bern b . gallaudet , f . j . brockway , and j . p . mcmurrich , who also edited the fifteenth edition ( october 1901 ) . there is also an edition dated 1896 which does still reference the english edition stating it is '' a new edition , thoroughly revised by american authorities , from the thirteenth english edition '' and edited by t . pickering pick , f.r.c.s . and published by lea brothers & co . , philadelphia and new york . gray , henry gray 's anatomy descriptive and surgical , 1896 13th edition the sixteenth edition ( october 1905 ) was edited by j . c . dacosta , and the seventeenth ( september 1908 ) by dacosta and e . a . spitzka . spitzka edited the eighteenth ( oct . 1910 ) and nineteenth ( july 1913 ) editions , and in october 1913 , r . howden edited the new american from the eighteenth english edition . the '' american '' editions then continued with consecutive numbering from the twentieth onwards , with w . h . lewis editing the 20th ( september . 1918 ) , 21st ( august 1924 ) , 22nd ( august 1930 ) , 23rd ( july 1936 ) , and 24th ( may 1942 ) . charles mayo goss edited the 25th ( august 1948 ) , 26th ( july 1954 ) , 27th ( august 1959 ) , 28th ( august 1966 ) , and 29th ( january 1973 ) . carmine d . clemente edited and extensively revised the 30th edition ( october 1984 ) . pp . vi–ix with the sale of lea & febiger in 1990 , the 30th edition was the last american edition . discrepancies in numbering of american and british editions . sometimes separate editing efforts with mismatches between british and american edition numbering led to the existence , for many years , of two main '' flavours '' or '' branches '' of gray 's anatomy : the u.s . and the british one . this can easily cause misunderstandings and confusion , especially when quoting from or trying to purchase a certain edition . for example , a comparison of publishing histories shows that the american numbering kept roughly apace with the british up until the 16th editions in 1905 , with the american editions either acknowledging the english edition , or simply matching the numbering in the 14th , 15th and 16th editions . then the american numbering crept ahead , with the 17th american edition published in 1908 , while the 17th british edition was published in 1909 . this increased to a three-year gap for the 18th and 19th editions , leading to the 1913 publication of the new american from the eighteenth english , which brought the numbering back into line . both 20th editions were then published in the same year ( 1918 ) . thereafter , it was the british numbering that pushed ahead , with the 21st british edition in 1920 , and the 21st american edition in 1924 . this discrepancy continued to increase , so that the 30th british edition was published in 1949 , while the 30th and last american edition was published in 1984 . carmine d . clemente ( 1985 ) p . vi ( american editions of gray 's anatomy – listings ) . currently available editions . the newest , 41st edition of gray 's anatomy was published on 25 september 2015 by elsevier in both print and online versions , and is the first edition to have enhanced online content including anatomical videos and a bonus gray 's imaging library . the 41st edition also has 24 specially invited online commentaries on contemporary anatomical topics such as advances in electron and fluorescent microscopy ; the neurovascular bundles of the prostate ; stem cells in regenerative medicine ; the anatomy of facial aging ; and technical aspects and applications of diagnostic radiology . the senior editor of this book and accompanying website on expertconsult is professor susan standring , who is emeritus professor of anatomy at king 's college london . the three most recent editions differ from all previous editions in an important aspect : they present anatomical structures by their regional anatomy ( i.e . ordered according to what part of the body the structures are located in – e.g . the anatomy of the bones , blood vessels and nerves , etc . of the upper limb is described in one place ) . all editions of gray 's anatomy previous to the 39th were organized by systemic anatomy ( i.e . there were separate sections for the body 's entire skeletal system , entire circulatory system and entire nervous system , etc . ) . the editors of the 39th edition acknowledged the validity of both approaches but switched to regional anatomy by popular demand . older , out-of-copyright editions of the book continue to be reprinted and sold , particularly on the internet . however it is not always clear which ( british or american ) edition these books are republications of . many seem to be reprints of the 1901 ( probably u.s . ) edition . additionally , there are several sites where various older versions can be read online . henry gray wrote gray 's anatomy with an audience of medical students and physicians in mind , especially surgerys . for many decades however , precisely because gray 's textbook became such a classic , successive editors made major efforts to preserve its position as possibly the most authoritative text on the subject in english . toward this end , a long-term strategy appears to have been to make each edition come close to containing a fully comprehensive account of the anatomical medical understanding available at the time of publication . the explosion of medical knowledge in the 20th century led to a vast expansion of the book , which threatened to collapse under its own weight metaphorically and physically . from the 35th edition onward , increased efforts were made to reverse this trend and keep the book readable by students . nevertheless , the 38th edition contained 2,092 pages in large format gray 's anatomy : the anatomical basis of medicine and surgery ( british edition . 38th ed ) ( hardcover ) amazon – the highest page count of any and an increase from the 35th edition , which had 1,471 pages . description of 35th edition ( 1973 ) at worldcat retrieved 21 march 2012 the current 41st edition has 1,584 pages . newer editions of gray 's anatomy – and even several recent older ones – are still considered to be the most comprehensive and detailed textbooks on the subject .
