british scriptwriters . he then returned to argentina , despite the harsh economic times there . from there , he moved again to italy in 1962 where he started a collaboration with the children 's comic book magazine il corriere dei piccoli , for which he adapted several classics of adventure literature , including treasure island and kidnapped by robert louis stevenson . in 1967 , pratt met florenzo ivaldi ; the two created a comics magazine named after his character , il sergente kirk , the hero first written by héctor oesterheld . in the first issue , pratt 's most famous story was published : una ballata del mare salato ( a ballad of the salt sea ) , which introduced his best known character , corto maltese . corto 's series continued three years later in the french magazine pif gadget . due to his rather mixed family ancestry , pratt had learned snippets of things like kabbalism and much history . many of his stories are placed in real historical eras and deal with real events : the 1755 war between france and british colonists in ticonderoga , colonial wars in africa and both world wars , for example . pratt did exhaustive research for factual and visual details , and some characters are real historical figures or loosely based on them , like corto 's main friend/enemy , rasputin . many of the minor characters cross over into other stories in a way that places all of pratt ’ s stories into the same continuum . pratt 's main series in the second part of his career include gli scorpioni del deserto ( five stories ) and jesuit joe . he also wrote stories for his friend and pupil milo manara for tutto ricominciò con un'estate indiana and el gaucho . later years . from 1970 to 1984 , pratt lived mainly in france where corto maltese , a psychologically very

magazine pif gadget , it brought him much popular and critical success . later published in album format , this series was eventually translated into fifteen languages . from 1984 to 1995 pratt lived in switzerland where the international success that corto maltese sparked continued to grow . in france , most of his pre-corto maltese works were published in several album editions by publishers such as casterman , dargaud , and humanoides associés . a wanderer by nature , hugo pratt continued to travel from canada to patagonia , from africa to the pacific area . he died of bowel cancer on 20
