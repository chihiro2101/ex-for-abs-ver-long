1635 , george inherited the principality of calenberg and moved his residence to hanover . his son , christian louis , inherited the principality of lüneburg from george 's brother . calenberg and lüneburg were then shared between george 's sons until united in 1705 under his grandson , also called george , who subsequently became george i of great britain . all held the title duke of brunswick-lüneburg . george died in 1641 and was succeeded by : christian louis , 1st son of duke george , prince of calenberg ( 1641–1648 ) and prince of lüneburg ( 1648–1665 ) . he relinquished

wife , sophia of hanover , was declared heiress of the throne of england by the act of settlement 1701 , which decreed roman catholics could not accede to the throne . sophia was at that time the

kingdom and hanover ended with the death of william iv . succession to the hanoverian throne was regulated by semi-salic law ( agnatic-cognatic ) , which gave priority to all male lines before female lines , so that it passed not to queen victoria but to her uncle , the duke of cumberland . in 1901 , when queen victoria , the last british monarch provided by the house of hanover , died , her son and heir edward vii became the first british monarch of the house of saxe-coburg and gotha , edward taking his family name from that of his father , albert , prince consort . file : kensington palace

ernest augustus , king of hanover ( 1837–1851 ) file : georgevhannover.jpg king george v of hanover ( 1851–1866 ) the kingdom of hanover came to an end in 1866 when it was annexed by kingdom of prussia and the king of hanover ( and duke of cumberland ) forced to go into exile in austria . the 1866 rift between the house of hanover and the house of hohenzollern was settled only by the 1913 marriage of princess viktoria luise of prussia to ernest augustus , duke of brunswick , the last king 's grandson . prince-bishops of osnabrück . at the end of the thirty years ' war , the peace of westphalia ( 1648 ) awarded the prince-bishopric of osnabrück alternately to a catholic bishop and to a cadet branch of brunswick-lüneburg . since the treaty gave cadets priority over heirs and reigning princes , osnabrück became a form of appanage ( in alternation ) of the house of hanover . ernest augustus , elector of brunswick-lüneburg ( r . 1662–1698 ) , fourth son of george , duke of brunswick-lüneburg ernest augustus , duke of york and albany ( r . 1715–1728 ) , sixth son of ernest augustus , elector of brunswick-lüneburg prince frederick , duke of york and albany ( r . 1764–1802 ) , second son of george iii osnabrück was mediatized to hanover in 1803 . dukes of brunswick . in 1884 , the senior branch of the house of welf became extinct . by semi-salic law , the house of hanover would have acceded to the duchy of brunswick , but there had been strong prussian pressure against having george v of hanover or his son , the duke of cumberland , succeed to a member state of the german empire , at least without strong conditions , including swearing to the german constitution . by a law of 1879 , the duchy of brunswick established a temporary council of regency to take over at the duke 's death , and if necessary appoint a regent . the duke of cumberland proclaimed himself duke of brunswick at the duke 's death , and lengthy negotiations ensued , but were never resolved . prince albert of prussia was appointed regent ; after his death in 1906 , duke john albert of mecklenburg succeeded him . the duke of cumberland 's eldest son died in a car accident in 1912 ; the father renounced brunswick in favor of his younger son ernest augustus , who married the kaiser 's daughter victoria louise the same year , swore allegiance to the german empire , and was allowed to ascend the throne of the duchy in november 1913 . he was a major-general during the first world war ; but he was overthrown as duke of brunswick in 1918 . his father was also deprived of his british titles in 1919 , for '' bearing arms against great britain '' . after having left brunswick palace , the duke and his family moved back to their exile seat cumberland castle at gmunden , austria , but in 1924 he received blankenburg castle and some other estates in a settlement with the free state of brunswick , and moved there in 1930 . a few days before blankenburg was handed over to the red army by british and us forces in late 1945 , to become part of east germany , the family was able to quickly move to marienburg castle ( hanover ) with all their furniture , transported by british army trucks , on the order of king george vi . duke ernest augustus died at marienburg castle in 1953 . his herrenhausen palace in hanover had been completely destroyed during world war ii . his eldest son , prince ernest augustus , sold his remaining property at herrenhausen gardens in 1961 , but kept the nearby princely house , a small palace built in 1720 by george i for his daughter anna louise . it is now his grandson ernest augustus 's private home , along with marienburg castle . file : braunschweiger schloss.jpg brunswick palace file : wolfenbuettel schloss ( 2006 ) . jpg wolfenbüttel castle . claimants . the later heads of the house of hanover have been : george v ( 1866–1878 ) ernest augustus , crown prince of hanover , 3rd duke of cumberland and teviotdale ( 1878–1923 ) ernest augustus , duke of brunswick ( 1923–1953 ) , son of the previous ernest augustus , prince of hanover ( 1953–1987 ) ernest augustus , prince of hanover ( 1987–present ) prince ernst august of hanover ( born 1983 ) ( heir apparent ) the family has been resident in austria since 1866 and thus took on austrian nationality besides their german and british . since the later king ernest augustus had been created duke of cumberland and teviotdale and earl of armagh by his father george iii in 1799 , these british peerages were inherited by his descendants . in 1914 the title of a prince of great britain and ireland was additionally granted to the members of the house by king george v . these peerages and titles however were suspended under the titles deprivation act 1917 . privately however the british royal family ( of the house of saxe-coburg and gotha , alias house of windsor ) continued to call their german branch the cumberlands , for instance when edward viii described his visit to the family in gmunden in a letter to his mother in 1937 . however , the title royal prince of great britain and ireland had been entered into the family 's german passports , together with the german titles , in 1914 . after the german revolution of 1918–19 , with the abolishment of nobility 's privileges , in 1919 royalty and nobility lost their privileges as such in germany , hereditary titles thereafter being legally retained only as part of the surname , according to article 109 the weimar constitution . titles officially became parts of the last name . so , curiously , the british prince 's title is still part of the family 's last name in their german passports , while it is no longer mentioned in their british documents . on 29 august 1931 , ernest augustus , duke of brunswick , as head of the house of hanover , declared the formal resumption , for himself and his dynastic descendants , of use of his former british princely title as a secondary pretender , which style , '' royal prince of great britain and ireland '' , his grandson , the current head of the house , also called ernest augustus , continues to claim . ernst august ( geb.1954 )
