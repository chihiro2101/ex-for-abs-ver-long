George Santayana

early life . santayana was born on december 16 , 1863 , in madrid and spent his early childhood in ávila , spain . his mother josefina borrás was the daughter of a spanish official in the philippines and he was the only child of her second marriage . josefina borrás ' first husband was george sturgis , a boston merchant , with whom she had five children , two of whom died in infancy . she lived in boston for a few years following her husband 's death in 1857 ; in 1861 moved with her three surviving children to madrid . there she encountered agustín ruiz de santayana , an old friend from her years in the philippines . they married in 1862 . a colonial civil servant , ruiz de santayana was a painter and minor intellectual . the family lived in madrid and ávila . in 1869 , josefina borrás de santayana returned to boston with her three sturgis children , because she had promised her first husband to raise the children in the us . she left the six-year-old jorge with his father in spain . jorge and his father followed her to boston in 1872 . his father , finding neither boston nor his wife 's attitude to his liking , soon returned alone to ávila , and remained there the rest of his life . jorge did not see him again until he entered harvard college and began to take his summer vacations in spain . sometime during this period , jorge 's first name was anglicized as george , the english equivalent . education . santayana attended boston latin school and harvard college , where he studied under the philosophers william james and josiah royce and was involved in eleven clubs as an alternative to athletics . he was founder and president of the philosophical club , a member of the literary society known as the o.k . , an editor and cartoonist for the harvard lampoon , and co-founder of the literary journal the harvard monthly . parri , alice two harvard friends : charles loeser and george santayana in december , 1885 , he played the role of lady elfrida in the hasty pudding theatrical robin hood , followed by the production papillonetta in the spring of his senior year . garrison , lloyd mckim , an illustrated history of the hasty pudding club theatricals , cambridge , hasty pudding club , 1897 . after graduating from harvard and he was a member of the phi beta kappa student fraternity who belongs to phi beta kappa , ’ phi beta kappa website ’ ’ , accessed oct 4 , 2009 in 1886 , santayana studied for two years in berlin . he then returned to harvard to write his dissertation on hermann lotze ( 1889 ) . george santayana , lotze 's system of philosophy , ph.d . , 1889 he was a professor at harvard from 1889-1912 , '' george santayana '' , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy becoming part of the golden age of the harvard philosophy department . some of his harvard students became famous in their own right , including t . s . eliot , robert frost , gertrude stein , horace kallen , walter lippmann , and w . e . b . du bois . wallace stevens was not among his students but became a friend . lensing , george s . ( 1986 ) . wallace stevens : a poet 's growth . lsu press . 313 pp . p.12-13 . from 1896 to 1897 , santayana studied at king 's college , cambridge . . later life . santayana never married . his romantic life , if any , is not well understood . some evidence , including a comment santayana made late in life comparing himself to a . e . housman , and his friendships with people who were openly homosexual and bisexual , has led scholars to speculate that santayana was perhaps homosexual or bisexual , but it remains unclear whether he had any actual heterosexual or homosexual relationships . in 1912 , santayana resigned his position at harvard to spend the rest of his life in europe . he had saved money and been aided by a legacy from his mother . after some years in ávila , paris and oxford , after 1920 , he began to winter in rome , eventually living there year-round until his death . during his 40 years in europe , he wrote 19 books and declined several prestigious academic positions . many of his visitors and correspondents were americans , including his assistant and eventual literary executor , daniel cory . in later life , santayana was financially comfortable , in part because his 1935 novel , the last puritan , had become an unexpected best-seller . in turn , he financially assisted a number of writers , including bertrand russell , with whom he was in fundamental disagreement , philosophically and politically . santayana 's one novel , the last puritan , is a bildungsroman , centering on the personal growth of its protagonist , oliver alden . his persons and places is an autobiography . these works also contain many of his sharper opinions and bons mots . he wrote books and essays on a wide range of subjects , including philosophy of a less technical sort , literary criticism , the history of ideas , politics , human nature , morals , the influence of religion on culture and social psychology , all with considerable wit and humor . while his writings on technical philosophy can be difficult , his other writings are more accessible and pithy . he wrote poems and a few plays , and left ample correspondence , much of it published only since 2000 . like alexis de tocqueville , santayana observed american culture and character from a foreigner 's point of view . like william james , his friend and mentor , he wrote philosophy in a literary way . ezra pound includes santayana among his many cultural references in the cantos , notably in '' canto lxxxi '' and '' canto xcv '' . santayana is usually considered an american writer , although he declined to become an american citizen , resided in fascist italy for decades , and said that he was most comfortable , intellectually and aesthetically , at oxford university . following 1935 and the writing of his only novel the last puritan , he continued to winter in rome , eventually living there year-round until his death . although an atheist , santayana considered himself an '' aesthetic catholic '' and spent the last decade of his life in a roman residence under the care of catholic nuns . in 1941 , he entered a retirement home run by blue nuns of the little company of mary on the celian hill at 6 via santo stefano rotondo in roma , where he was cared for by the irish sisters until his death in september 1952 . upon his death , he did not want to be buried in consecrated land , which made his burial problematic in italy . finally , the spanish consulate in rome agreed that he be buried in the pantheon of the obra pía española , in the campo verano in rome . philosophical work and publications . santayana 's main philosophical work consists of the sense of beauty ( 1896 ) , his first book-length monograph and perhaps the first major work on aesthetics written in the united states ; the life of reason five volumes , 1905–6 , the high point of his harvard career ; skepticism and animal faith ( 1923 ) ; and the realms of being ( 4 vols . , 1927–40 ) . although santayana was not a pragmatism in the mold of william james , charles sanders peirce , josiah royce , or john dewey , the life of reason arguably is the first extended treatment of pragmatism written . like many of the classical pragmatists , and because he was well-versed in evolutionary theory , santayana was committed to metaphysical naturalism . he believed that human cognition , cultural practices , and social institutions have evolved so as to harmonize with the conditions present in their environment . their value may then be adjudged by the extent to which they facilitate human happiness . the alternate title to the life of reason , '' the phases of human progress , '' is indicative of this metaphysics stance . santayana was an early adherent of epiphenomenalism , but also admired the classical materialism of democritus and lucretius . ( of the three authors on whom he wrote in three philosophical poets , santayana speaks most favorably of lucretius ) . he held spinoza 's writings in high regard , calling him his '' master and model .
