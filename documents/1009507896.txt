Thomas Sowell

late-talking and the einstein syndrome . sowell wrote the einstein syndrome : bright children who talk late , a follow-up to his late-talking children , discussing a condition he termed the einstein syndrome . this book investigates the phenomenon of late-talking children , frequently misdiagnosed with autism or pervasive developmental disorder . he includes the research of stephen camarata and steven pinker , among others , in this overview of a poorly understood developmental trait . it is a trait which he says affected many historical figures who developed prominent careers , such as physicists albert einstein , wolff , barbara , and hananya goodman . '' the legend of the dull-witted child who grew up to be a genius . '' albert einstein archives . is : hebrew university of jerusalem . edward teller , and richard feynman ; mathematician julia robinson ; and musicians arthur rubinstein and clara schumann . he makes the case for the theory that some children develop unevenly ( asynchronous development ) for a period in childhood due to rapid and extraordinary development in the analytical functions of the brain . this may temporarily '' rob resources '' from neighboring functions such as language development . as such , sowell disagrees with simon baron-cohen 's speculation that einstein may have had asperger syndrome . . politics . in a townhall editorial , titled '' the bush legacy '' , sowell assessed president george w . bush as '' a mixed bag '' but '' an honorable man . '' sowell was strongly critical of republican presidential nominee donald trump , and officially endorsed ted cruz in the 2016 republican presidential primaries in a february article . however , he indicated that he would vote in the general election against democratic nominee hillary clinton , due to fears about the appointments clinton would possibly make to the supreme court . in 2020 , sowell wrote that if the democratic presidential nominee joe biden won the 2020 presidential election , it could signal a point of no return for the united states , a tipping point akin to the fall of the roman empire . in an interview in july 2020 , he stated that '' the roman empire overcame many problems in its long history but eventually it reached a point where it could no longer continue on , and much of that was from within , not just the barbarians attacking from outside . '' sowell wrote that if biden became president , the democratic party would have a huge amount of control over the country and if this happened , they could twin with the '' radical left '' and ideas such as defunding the police could come to fruition . . donald trump . two weeks before the 2016 presidential election , sowell urged voters to vote for donald trump over hillary clinton . in 2018 , when asked on his thoughts of trump 's presidency , sowell replied '' i think he 's better than the previous president .

'' interview with the legendary thomas sowell : his new book , his legacy , and what he thinks of trump and the future of america '' ( podcast ) . ep . 5 in the conservative book club podcast . us : the conservative book club . in march 2019 , sowell commented on the public 's response to mainstream media 's allegations that trump is a racist : '' what 's tragic is that there 's so many people out there who simply respond to words rather than ask themselves 'is what this person says true ? how can i check it ? ' and so on . '' '' sowell : politicians using race as their ticket to whatever racket they 're running . '' the ingraham angle . fox news . march 6 , 2019 . via youtube . a month later , sowell again defended trump against media charges of racism , stating : '' i 've seen no hard evidence . and , unfortunately , we ’ re living in a time where no one expects hard evidence . you just repeat some familiar words and people will react pretty much the way pavlov 's dog was conditioned to react to certain sounds . '' sowell , thomas . march 22 , 2019 . '' no hard evidence trump is a racist . '' fox & friends . – via realclearpolitics . . education . sowell has written about education throughout his career . he has argued for the need for reform of the school system in the united states . in his latest book , charter schools and their enemies ( 2020 ) , sowell compares the educational outcomes of school children educated at charter schools with those at conventional public schools . in his research , sowell first explains the need and his methodology for choosing comparable students—both ethnically and socioeconomically—before listing his findings . he presents the case that charter schools on the whole do significantly better in terms of educational outcomes than conventional schools . sowell also writes about the importance of education for young people . he argues that many schools are failing children in their educations . this is for numerous reasons among which he argues are that indoctrination has taken the place of proper education , teaching unions have been making unfair money out of schools and that many schools have become monopolies for educational bureaucracies . in his book , education : assumptions versus history ( 1986 ) , sowell analyzes the state of education in us schools and universities . in particular , he examines the experiences of blacks and other ethnic groups in the american education system and identifies the factors and patterns behind both success and failure . . reception . classical liberals , libertarians , and conservatives of different disciplines have received sowell 's work positively . higgins describes sowell as having written a '' brilliant trilogy on culture and societies ( race and culture , migrations and culture , and conquests and culture ) . his stature must be attributed to his ability to bring light where there is darkness and logic where there is confusion to public policy in general and economics in particular . '' among these , he has been noted for originality , great depth and breadth , clarity of expression , and thoroughness of research . sowell 's publications have been received positively by economists steven plaut and abigail thernstrom ; political science charles murray ; psychologists steven pinker and jonathan haidt ; josef joffe , publisher and editor of die zeit ; jay nordlinger , senior editor of national review ; theater critic and political commentator kevin d . williamson ; walter e . williams , professor of economics at george mason university ; and publishing executive steve forbes . other academics such as hampton university economist bernadette chachere , harvard university sociology william julius wilson , social scientist richard coughlin , and stanford law professor richard thompson ford have been critical of some of his work in book reviews . criticisms include failure to take into account discrimination against women at work in rhetoric or reality ? ; the lack of a coherent methodology in race and culture : a world view ; and caricature and then attacking liberal theory in intellectuals and race . . legacy and honors . 1982 : the mencken award for best book , from the free press association , for his ethnic america : a history . 1990 : the francis boyer award , presented by the american enterprise institute . 1998 : the sydney hook award , from the national association of scholars . jim nelson black ( 2004 ) .
