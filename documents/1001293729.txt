The Observer

history . origins . the first issue , published on 4 december 1791 by w.s . bourne , was the world 's first sunday newspaper . believing that the paper would be a means of wealth , bourne instead soon found himself facing debts of nearly £1,600 . though early editions purported editorial independence , bourne attempted to cut his losses and sell the title to the government . when this failed , bourne 's brother ( a wealthy businessman ) made an offer to the government , which also refused to buy the paper but agreed to subsidise it in return for influence over its editorial content . as a result , the paper soon took a strong line against radicals such as thomas paine , francis burdett and joseph priestley . 19th century . in 1807 , the brothers decided to relinquish editorial control , naming lewis doxat as the new editor . seven years later , the brothers sold the observer to william innell clement , a newspaper proprietor who owned a number of publications . the paper continued to receive government subsidies during this period ; in 1819 , of the approximately 23,000 copies of the paper distributed weekly , approximately 10,000 were given away as '' specimen copies '' , distributed by postmen who were paid to deliver them to '' lawyers , doctors , and gentlemen of the town . '' dennis griffiths ( ed . ) , the encyclopedia of the british press , 1422–1992 , london and basingstoke : macmillan , 1992 , p . 159 . yet the paper began to demonstrate a more independent editorial stance , criticising the authorities ' handling of the events surrounding the peterloo massacre and defying an 1820 court order against publishing details of the trial of the cato street conspiracy , who were alleged to have plotted to murder members of the cabinet . the woodcut pictures published of the stable and hayloft where the conspirators were arrested reflected a new stage of illustrated journalism that the newspaper pioneered during this time . clement maintained ownership of the observer until his death in 1852 . during that time , the paper supported reform act 1832 , but opposed a broader franchise and the chartism leadership . after doxat retired in 1857 , clement 's heirs sold the paper to joseph snowe , who also took over the editor 's chair . under snowe , the paper adopted a more liberal political stance , supporting the north during the american civil war , and endorsing universal manhood suffrage in 1866 . these positions contributed to a decline in circulation during this time . in 1870 , wealthy businessman julius beer bought the paper and appointed edward dicey as editor , whose efforts succeeded in reviving circulation . though beer 's son frederick became the owner upon julius 's death in 1880 , he had little interest in the newspaper and was content to leave dicey as editor until 1889 . henry duff traill took over the editorship after dicey 's departure , only to be replaced in 1891 by frederick 's wife , rachel beer , of the sassoon family . though circulation declined during her tenure , she remained as editor for thirteen years , combining it in 1893 with the editorship of the sunday times , a newspaper that she had also bought . . 20th century . upon frederick 's death in 1903 , the paper was purchased by the newspaper magnate lord northcliffe . after maintaining the existing editorial leadership for a couple of years , in 1908 northcliffe named james louis garvin as editor . garvin quickly turned the paper into an organ of political influence , boosting circulation from 5,000 to 40,000 within a year of his arrival as a result . yet the revival in the paper 's fortunes masked growing political disagreements between garvin and northcliffe . these disagreements ultimately led northcliffe to sell the paper to william waldorf astor in 1911 , who transferred ownership to his son waldorf astor , 2nd viscount astor four years later . during this period , the astors were content to leave the control of the paper in garvin 's hands . under his editorship circulation reached 200,000 during the interwar years , a figure which garvin fought to maintain even during the depths of the great depression . politically the paper pursued an independent conservative stance , which eventually brought garvin into conflict with waldorf 's more liberal son david astor . their conflict contributed to garvin 's departure as editor in 1942 , after which the paper took the unusual step of declaring itself non-partisan . ownership passed to waldorf 's sons in 1948 , with david taking over as editor . he remained in the position for 27 years , during which time he turned it into a trust-owned newspaper employing , among others , george orwell , paul jennings and c . a . lejeune . under astor 's editorship the observer became the first national newspaper to oppose the government 's suez crisis , a move which cost it many readers . in 1977 , the astors sold the ailing newspaper to us oil giant arco ( now called arco ) who sold it to lonrho in 1981 . it became part of the guardian media group in june 1993 , after a rival bid to acquire it by the independent was rejected . michael leapman , '' new editor chosen for 'observer ' : 'guardian ' deputy to succeed trelford '' , the independent , 14 may 1993 , accessed 22 january 2018 . farzad bazoft , a journalist for the observer , was executed in iraq in 1990 on charges of spying . in 2003 , the observer interviewed the iraqi colonel who had arrested and interrogated bazoft and who was convinced that bazoft was not a spy . ed vulliamy , '' writer hanged by iraq 'no spy ' '' , the guardian , 18 may 2003 , accessed 4 april 2007 . . 21st century . in 2003 the editorial supported the iraq war , stating '' military intervention in the middle east holds many dangers . but if we want a lasting peace it may be the only option .
