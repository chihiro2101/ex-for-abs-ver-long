Fletcher Henderson

biography . james fletcher hamilton henderson was born in cuthbert , georgia , in 1897 . he grew up in a middle-class african-american family . his father , fletcher hamilton henderson ( 1857–1943 ) , was the principal of the nearby howard normal randolph school from 1880 until 1942 . his home , now known as the fletcher henderson house , is a historic site . his mother , a teacher , taught him and his brother horace to play the piano . he began lessons by the age of six . his father would occasionally lock fletcher in his room to practice for hours . by age 13 , henderson possessed a keen ability to read music and sense pitch . he pursued the studies with his mother and further engaged himself in lessons on european art . although a talented musician , henderson decided to dedicate himself to math and science . at age 18 he moved to atlanta , georgia , and changed his name to fletcher henderson , giving up james , his grandfather 's name . he attended atlanta university ( where he was a member of the fraternity alpha phi alpha ) and graduated in 1920 with a bachelor 's degree in chemistry and mathematics . after graduation , he moved to new york city with the intention of attending columbia university for a master 's degree in chemistry , but there is no evidence that he actually enrolled . he did get a part-time job as a lab assistant in a downtown manhattan chemistry firm , but this only lasted a year . in new york city , henderson shared an apartment with a pianist who worked as a musician in a riverboat orchestra . when his roommate was too sick to perform , henderson took his place , which soon gave him a job as a full-time replacement . in the fall of 1920 he found work as a song demonstrator with the pace and handy music co . henderson now found that music would be more profitable than chemistry and left his job as a lab chemist to begin a life in music . when pace left the company to start black swan records , he took henderson with him to be musical director , a job which lasted from 1921-1923 . from 1920-1923 , he primarily played piano accompaniment for blues singers . henderson toured with the black swan troubadours featuring ethel waters from october 1921 to july 1922 . after hearing louis armstrong in new orleans while on tour in april 1922 , henderson sent him an offer , but armstrong refused because henderson would not hire zutty singleton as well . his activities up to the end of 1923 were mainly recording dates for black swan and other labels . his band at this point was only a pick-up unit for recordings , not a regular working band . in january 1924 the recording band became the house band at the club alabam at 216 w . 44th st . despite many erroneous publications indicating otherwise , this 1924 band was henderson 's first working band . in july 1924 the band began a brief engagement at the roseland ballroom . although only meant to stay for a few months , the band was brought back for the autumn season . henderson called on the 23-year-old cornetist louis armstrong for a second time to join the band . henderson 's offer on october 13 , 1924 made history when the henderson band began their re-engagement at roseland with armstrong now in the orchestra . quickly the band became known as the best african-american band in new york . by late 1924 the arrangements by don redman were featuring more solo work . in addition to adding hot solos to arrangements , redman arranged armstrong 's repertoire with the king oliver 's creole jazz band , such as turning '' dippermouth blues '' into '' sugar foot stomp . '' armstrong played in the band for only a year because he could not grow accustomed to the arrangements and to the '' pretension '' of the other band members . despite this , his influence on the henderson band and all jazz during this time can not be overstated . through his hot solos , knowledge of jazz repertoire , and introduction of clarinetist buster bailey to the band , armstrong turned henderson 's orchestra into a jazz band . henderson 's band boasted the formidable arranging talents of don redman . after redman 's departure from the band in 1927 , henderson took on some of the arranging , but benny carter was redman 's replacement as saxophone player and arranger from 1930–31 , and henderson also bought scores from freelance musicians ( including john nesbitt from mckinney 's cotton pickers ) . henderson developed his arranging skills from 1931 to the mid-1930s . his band c . 1925 included howard scott , coleman hawkins ( who started with henderson in 1923 , playing the tuba parts on a bass saxophone , and quickly moving to tenor saxophone and a leading solo role ) , louis armstrong , charlie dixon , kaiser marshall , buster bailey , elmer chambers , charlie green , ralph escudero , and don redman . in 1925 , with henry troy , he wrote '' gin house blues '' , recorded by bessie smith and nina simone among others . his other compositions include '' soft winds '' . henderson recorded extensively in the 1920s for nearly every label , including vocalion , paramount , columbia , olympic , ajax , pathé , perfect , edison , emerson , brunswick , and the dime-store labels banner , oriole , regal , cameo , and romeo . from 1925–1930 , he recorded primarily for columbia and brunswick/ vocalion under his own name and a series of acoustic recordings as the dixie stompers for harmony records and associated dime-store labels ( diva and velvet tone ) . during the 1930s , he recorded for columbia , crown ( as '' connie 's inn orchestra '' ) , arc ( melotone , perfect , oriole , vocalion ) , bluebird , victor , and decca . starting in the early 1920s , he recorded popular hits and jazz tunes . in 1924 he and his band recorded 80 sides . his version of the pop tune '' i ca n't get the one i want '' , recorded about june 19 , 1924 , was issued on at least 23 labels . in addition to armstrong , lead trumpeters included red allen , joe smith , rex stewart , tommy ladnier , doc cheatham and roy eldridge . lead saxophonists included coleman hawkins , buster bailey , benny carter and chu berry . sun ra also worked as an arranger during the 1940s , during henderson 's engagement at the club delisa in chicago . sun ra said that on first hearing henderson 's orchestra as a teenager he assumed that they were angels because no human could produce such beautiful music . although henderson 's band was popular , he had little success in managing it . his lack of recognition outside of harlem had to do more with the times in which he lived , apparently lackluster management , and the hard times that resulted after the 1929 stock market crash . fletcher had a knack for finding talent , but he did not have much luck keeping it . on many occasions he lost talented members to other bandleaders . he also had trouble with finances . when the band split up in 1934 , he was forced to sell some of his popular arrangements to benny goodman to keep them together . after about 1931 , his own arrangements became influential . in addition to arrangements for his band , he wrote arrangements for teddy hill , isham jones and benny goodman . his shoulder was injured in an auto accident in 1928 . his wife , leora , blamed the accident for his diminishing success . she said that john hammond and goodman bought henderson 's arrangements to support him , that goodman always gave henderson credit for the arrangements and said that he played them better than his own . in addition , goodman and hammond organized broadcasts and recordings to help henderson when he was ill . reading jazz , ed . robert gottlieb four decades later , two of his songs , '' queer notions '' and '' yeah , man ! '' were performed in the movie kansas city . benny goodman . in 1935 , goodman 's orchestra was selected as a house band for the nbc radio program let 's dance . since goodman needed new charts every week for the show , his friend john hammond suggested that he purchase some from henderson . many of goodman 's hits from the swing era were played by henderson and his own band in the late 1920s and early 1930s , usually as head arrangements , which he transcribed from his own records and then sold to goodman . however , his brother horace henderson recounted ( in ross firestone 's biography of goodman , swing , swing , swing ) that the clarinetist made heavy demands on henderson for fresh charts while his band was engaged for the let 's dance show in 1934–35 , and that he himself helped his brother complete some of them . the singer helen ward also stated that henderson was delighted to hear the goodman orchestra realize his creations with such impeccable musicianship . in 1939 , henderson disbanded his band and joined goodman 's , first as pianist and arranger and then working full-time as staff arranger . he re-formed bands of his own several times in the 1940s and toured with ethel waters again in 1948–1949 . henderson suffered a stroke in 1950 , resulting in partial paralysis that ended his days as a pianist . he died in new york city in 1952 , eleven days after his 55th birthday . contributions to jazz and the harlem renaissance . henderson , along with don redman , established the formula for swing music . the two broke the band into sections ( sax section , trumpet section , etc ) . these sections worked together to create a unique sound . sometimes , the sections would play in call-and-response style , and at other times one section would play supporting riffs behind the other . swing , its popularity spanning over a decade , was the most fashionable form of jazz ever in the united states . henderson was also responsible for bringing louis armstrong from chicago to new york in october 1924 , thus flipping the focal point of jazz in the history of the united states ( although armstrong left the band in november 1925 and returned to chicago ) . henderson also played a key role in bringing improvisatory jazz styles from new orleans and other areas of the country to new york , where they merged with a dance-band tradition that relied heavily on arrangements written out in musical notation . a museum is being established in his memory in cuthbert , georgia . henderson differed from other musicians in his time . he made the idea of playing jazz exclusively popular to ambitious , young , black musicians . he made it financially stable and a way to seize cultural power during the time . henderson was genuine when it came to the appearance of the band . he was all for making an impact on the era . henderson would intently see to it that each member had a clean-shaven face , a tuxedo , and polished shoes . it was recorded that he would do this before every performance , especially ones in predominantly white communities , such as times square . henderson created a band that was capable of playing dance music and complex arrangements . louis metcalf said , '' the sight of fletcher henderson 's men playing behind music stands brought on a learning-to-read-music kick in harlem which had n't cared before it . there were two years of real concentration . everybody greeted you with 'how 's studying ?
