Mytilene

archaeology . archaeological investigations at mytilene began in the late 19th century when robert koldewey ( later excavator of babylon ) and a group of german colleagues spent many months on the island preparing plans of the visible remains at various ancient sites like mytilene . significant excavations , however , do not seem to have started until after the first world war when in the mid-1920s evangelides uncovered much of the famous theatre ( according to plutarch it was the inspiration for pompey 's theatre in rome in 55 bc , the first permanent stone theatre in rome ) on the hill on the western side of town . subsequent work in the 1950s , 1960s and 1970s by various members of the archaeological service revealed more of the theatre , including a roman conversion to a gladiatorial arena . salvage excavations carried out by the archaeological service in many areas of the city have revealed sites going back to the early bronze age although most have been much later ( hellenistic and roman ) . particularly significant is a large stoa over a hundred metres long recently dug on the north harbour of the city . it is clear from various remains in different parts of the city that mytilene was indeed laid out on a grid plan as the roman architect vitruvius had written . archaeological excavations carried out between 1984 and 1994 in the castle of mytilene by the university of british columbia and directed by caroline and hector williams revealed a previously unknown sanctuary of demeter and kore of late classical/hellenistic date and the burial chapel of the gattelusi , the medieval genoa family that ruled the northern aegean from the mid-14th to mid-15th centuries of our era . the demeter sanctuary included five altars for sacrifices to demeter and kore and later also to cybele , the great mother goddess of anatolia . among the discoveries were thousands of oil lamps , terracotta figurines , loom weights and other dedications to the goddesses . numerous animal bones , especially of piglets , also appeared . the chapel of st . john served as the church of the castle and as a burial place for the gattelusi family and its dependents . although conversion to a mosque after the ottoman capture of the city in 1462 resulted in the destruction of many graves , some remained . the great earthquake of february 1867 damaged the building beyond repair and it was demolished ; the ottomans built a new mosque over the ruins to replace it later in the 19th century . other excavations done jointly with the 20th ephorate of prehistoric and classical antiquities near the north harbour of the city uncovered a multiperiod site with remains extending from a late ottoman cemetery ( including a '' vampire '' burial , a middle aged man with spikes through his neck , middle and ankles ) to a substantial roman building constructed around a colonnaded courtyard ( probably a tavern/brothel in its final phase in the mid-4th century ad ) to remains of hellenistic structures and debris from different hellenistic manufacturing processes ( pottery , figurines , cloth making and dyeing , bronze and iron working ) to archaic and classical levels with rich collections of aeolic grey wares . a section of the late classical city wall runs across the site which was close to the channel that divided the mainland from the off shore island part of the city . considerable remains of the two moles that protected the large north harbour of the city are still visible just below or just breaking the surface of the sea ; it functioned as the commercial harbour of the ancient city although today it is a quiet place where a few small fishing boats are moored . the city has two excellent archaeological museums , one by the south harbour in an old mansion and the other two hundred metres further north in a large new purpose built structure . the former contains the rich bronze age remains from thermi , a site north of mytilene dug by the british in the 1930s as well as extensive pottery and figurine displays ; the former coach house accommodates ancient inscriptions , architectural pieces , and coins . the latter museum is especially rich in mosaics and sculpture , including the famous late roman mosaic floor from the '' house of menander '' with scenes from plays by that athenian 4th-century bc playwright . there are also mosaics and finds from other roman mansions excavated by the greek archaeological service under the direction of the archeologist aglaia archontidou-argyri . education . there are 15 primary schools in mytilene , along with seven lyceums , and eight gymnasiums . there are six university schools with 3671 undergraduates , the largest in the university of the aegean . here also is the headquarters , the central library and the research committee of aegean university . the university of aegean is housed in privately owned buildings , in rented buildings located in the city centre and in modern buildings on the university hill . sporting clubs . aiolikos f.c . , football club sappho lesvou f.c . , women 's football club . notable mytilenians . ancient . alcaeus ( 6th century bc ) , greek
