'' terry 's theatre '' , the morning post , 27 january 1890 , p . 2 this piece concerns an impoverished clerk , a bibulous but wise barrister , fraudulent bankers , a long-lost sweetheart and happy endings all round . it was billed as '' a domestic drama '' , and was mainly comic , but , the era reported , '' there are scenes where the laughter is hushed , where smiles give way to tears , and where mirth is merged in heartfelt sympathy '' . '' terry 's '' , the era , 24 march 1888 , p . 14 . serious plays . plays in a similar vein to sweet lavender – the weaker sex ( 1888 ) and lady bountiful ( 1891 ) – did not match its success , running for 61 and 65 performances respectively . nonetheless pinero 's attention continued to turn more to serious than to farcical topics . wearing comments that pinero began to write '' problem plays '' , considering '' the double standard of morality , applied unequally to men and women '' . his first was the profligate ( 1889 ) , in which past misdeeds come to haunt a seemingly respectable man . it was chosen to inaugurate the new garrick theatre , but the lessee , john hare , persuaded a reluctant pinero to tone down the ending to avoid alienating his respectable society audience : in the final version the protagonist does not kill himself , as pinero had written , but is forgiven by his wife . dawick , p . 159 the play ran for 129 performances . when his next such drama came to be produced pinero remained firm : the play would , and did , end in tragedy . this was his best-known serious work , the second mrs tanqueray ( 1893 ) . while he was planning it , several plays of henrik ibsen were presented in london for the first time , regarded by much of polite society as avant garde , blunt and shocking . seeing ghosts led pinero to reconsider his approach to playwriting , which now seemed old-fashioned by comparison . he was far from uncritical of ibsen 's plays , but recognised that if he was to be a serious dramatist he must treat social problems and human misconduct frankly . the second mrs tanqueray centred on '' a woman with a past '' . hare declined to present it , and george alexander , the actor-manager running the st james 's theatre , to whom pinero then offered the play , said , '' sorry , i dare n't do it '' . dawick , p . 181 he had second thoughts , and accepted it . the production was scheduled to replace oscar wilde 's lady windermere 's fan , which also focused on a woman with a far from respectable past . unlike pinero 's play , wilde 's ended happily , and was seen by the respectable habitués of the st james 's as mildly shocking but acceptable . pearson , p . 74 in pinero 's play paula tanqueray kills herself . in wearing 's words , '' although not as avant-garde as ibsen 's plays , tanqueray confronted its fashionable st james 's audiences with as forceful a social message as they could stomach '' . both pinero and alexander were apprehensive about the public reception of the piece , but it was a sensational success at its opening in may 1893 , made a profit of more than £10,000 , and was still playing to full houses when alexander , who disliked acting in long runs , closed the production in april 1894 after 225 performances . dawick , p . 200 wearing comments that the public 's appetite for similar pinero plays varied . the notorious mrs ebbsmith ( 1895 ) managed a run of 88 performances , the benefit of the doubt ( 1895 ) ran for 74 , the thunderbolt ( 1908 ) and mid-channel ( 1909 ) both ran for 58 . . fin de siècle . the year 1898 saw one of pinero 's most enduring successes and his most conspicuous failure . the first was trelawny of the 'wells ' , the second , the beauty stone . in trelawny of the '' wells '' , described by a 21st-century critic as '' pinero 's love letter to theatre '' , spencer , charles . '' trelawny of the wells '' , the telegraph , 22 february 2013 the author addressed his regular topics of class and inexorable change , to which he added a study of the enduring power of the theatre . the play shows a popular actress in mid-victorian melodramas marrying into the aristocracy , regretting it , returning to the stage and finding that she can no longer make the old style of plays work , successfully switching to works in the new realistic style . wearing calls the play pinero 's homage to tom robertson , whose pioneering theatrical realism influenced two generations of writers including w . s . gilbert and bernard shaw as well as pinero . durbach , errol . '' remembering tom robertson ( 1829–1871 ) '' , educational theatre journal , october 1972 , pp . 284–288 the critics were confused by the play . pinero commented that they seemed '' divided as to whether the piece is a weak farce or an imperfect realistic drama '' . dawick , p . 240 it had a good , though not outstanding , run of 135 performances at the court , but subsequently became one of pinero 's most revived plays . at the same time the impresario richard d'oyly carte was in need of a new opera for his savoy theatre after the end of gilbert and sullivan 's long partnership . it is not clear why carte chose to commission a libretto from two writers with no experience in the genre , but for arthur sullivan 's the beauty stone he brought together pinero and j . comyns carr , an art critic , gallery owner and part-time author of dramas . parry ( 2013 ) , p . 20 : source : dawick . dawick , pp . 404–409 . broadway productions . the original london productions that were followed by new york productions were : the money spinner ( new york , 1882 ) ; the squire ( 1882 ) ; girls and boys ( 1883 ) ; lords and commons ( 1884 ) ; in chancery ( 1885 ) ; the magistrate ( 1885 ) ; the schoolmistress ( 1886 ) ; dandy dick ( 1887 ) ; sweet lavender ( 1888 ) ; lady bountiful ( 1891 ) ; the cabinet minister ( 1892 ) ; the second mrs tanqueray ( 1893 ) ; the amazons ( 1894 ) ; the notorious mrs ebbsmith ( 1895 ) ; the benefit of the doubt ( 1896 ) ; the princess and the butterfly ( 1897 ) ; trelawny of the wells ( 1898 ) ; the gay lord quex ( 1900 ) ; iris ( 1902 ) ; letty ( 1904 ) ; a wife without a smile ( 1904 ) ; his house in order ( 1906 ) ; mid-channel ( 1910 ) ; preserving mr . panmure ( 1912 ) ; the '' mind-the-paint '' girl ( 1912 ) ; and the enchanted cottage ( 1923 ) . . revivals . among the notable british revivals of pinero plays singled out in john dawick 's 1993 study of the dramatist were : the magistrate : old vic , 1959 ; chichester festival and then cambridge theatre , london , 1969 ; national theatre , 1986 the schoolmistress : royal exchange theatre , manchester , 1979 dandy dick : mermaid theatre , london , 1965 ; chichester and then the garrick , london , 1973 sweet lavender : ambassadors theatre , london , 1922 the cabinet minister : royal exchange , 1987 ; albery theatre , london , 1991 the second mrs tanqueray : playhouse theatre , london , 1922 ; haymarket 1950 ; national theatre , 1981 trelawny of the '' wells '' : old vic , 1965 ; comedy theatre , london , 1992 ; national theatre , 1993 the gay lord quex : albery , 1975 : :source : dawick . in 2012 the times remarked on a revival in interest in pinero , with new productions of the second mrs tanqueray at the rose theatre , the magistrate at the national theatre , starring john lithgow in the title role , trelawney of the '' wells '' at the donmar , and dandy dick , with patricia hodge and nicholas le prevost . the paper commented , '' like terence rattigan in recent years , pinero is being dusted down , reappraised and hailed as one of the great british playwrights '' . hoyle , ben .

'' st james 's theatre , the times , 2 february 1906 , p . 4 by the time of pinero 's death in 1934 the paper had become less enthusiastic . both the times and the daily telegraph published polite obituaries that respectfully relegated his works to a bygone era . dawick , p . 374 for twenty years after his death pinero 's reputation remained in what dawick calls '' a state of near-eclipse '' . from the 1950s onwards interest in his court farces grew . in a 1972 study of the playwright , walter lazenby wrote , '' pinero can not be outranked as a farceur by any other english writer ; not even shakespeare consistently expended on this form the care and art which went into the court theatre farces or achieved such thoroughly satisfying results '' . lazenby , p . 155 reviewing the book , the academic robert ronning agreed that the farces were pinero 's most enduring works : : the fact that students will continue to read the second mrs tanqueray instead of the magistrate does not mean much except for what they learn about craftsmanship , and this could be learned equally well from the farces . while we have seen considerable interest in the field of nineteenth century drama in recent years , one doubts if pinero 's social and problem plays will ever catch on . ronning , robert .
