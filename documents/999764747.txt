List of world records in chess

game length records . longest game . the longest tournament chess game ( in terms of moves ) ever to be played was nikolić–arsović , belgrade 1989 , which lasted for 269 moves and took 20 hours and 15 minutes to complete a drawn game . at the time this game was played , fide had modified the fifty-move rule to allow 100 moves to be played without a piece being captured in a rook and bishop versus rook endgame , the situation in nikolić versus arsović . fide has since rescinded that modification to the rule . the longest decisive tournament game is danin–azarov , turnov 2016 , which danin won in 239 moves . in the 9th round of tht extraliga ( highest czech team league ) , danin needed to win his game to make the match end in a 4:4 draw . although he managed to do so , his team ( tž třinec ) was relegated from the highest league in the end . the second longest decisive tournament game is fressinet–kosteniuk , villandry 2007 , which kosteniuk won in 237 moves . the last 116 moves were a rook and bishop versus rook ending , as in nikolić – arsović . fressinet could have claimed a draw under the fifty-move rule , but did not do so since neither player was keeping score , it being a rapid chess game . earlier in the tournament , korchnoi had successfully invoked the rule to claim a draw against fressinet ; the arbiters overruled fressinet 's argument that korchnoi could not do so without keeping score . fressinet , apparently wanting to be consistent , did not try to claim a draw against kosteniuk in the same situation . the longest game played in a world championship is the fifth game of the 1978 match between viktor korchnoi and anatoly karpov . korchnoi 's 124th move , as white , produced stalemate . shortest game . . shortest decisive game . the fewest moves required to deliver checkmate in chess is two , in what is known as fool 's mate ( 1.g4 e5 2.f3 qh4 and variants thereof ) . this has been known to occur in amateur play . chessgames.com gives a game l . darling–r . wood , 1983 , that was published on april fool 's day in northwest chess magazine ( 1.g4 e6 2.f4 ?

? 2.qh5 . edward winter , chess note 5858 . the same game had previously been played in leeky–mason , dublin 1867 . if one counts forfeited games as a loss in zero moves , it counts as a loss for tournament score , but not for rating calculations where a forfeit is treated as an unplayed game . then there have been many such forfeits , the most notable examples being game 2 of the world chess championship 1972 between boris spassky and bobby fischer , which fischer defaulted , and game 5 of the 2006 world championship match between vladimir kramnik and veselin topalov , which kramnik defaulted . chess informant , volume 98 , šahovski informator , 2007 , p . 295 . under recently instituted fide rules , a player who is late for the beginning of a round loses the game , as does a player who has a forbidden electronic device ( by default any device ) . the former rule was used at the 2009 chinese championship to forfeit hou yifan for arriving five seconds late for the beginning of a round . new rule . good or bad ? you decide . susanpolgar.blogspot.com . retrieved on october 25 , 2009 . the latter rule was used to forfeit aleksander delchev against stuart conquest after the move 1.d4 in the 2009 european team championship . the german grandmaster robert hübner also lost a game without playing any moves . in a world student team championship game played in graz in 1972 , hübner played one move and offered a draw to kenneth rogoff , who accepted . however , the arbiters insisted that some moves be played , so the players played the following ridiculous game : 1.c4 nf6 2.nf3 g6 3.ng1 bg7 4.qa4 0-0 5.qxd7 qxd7 6.g4 qxd2+ 7.kxd2 nxg4 8.b4 a5 9.a4 bxa1 10.bb2 nc6 11.bh8 bg7 12.h4 axb4 ( draw agreed ) . the arbiters ruled that both players must apologize and play an actual game at 7 p.m . rogoff appeared and apologized ; hübner did neither . hübner 's clock was started , and after an hour rogoff was declared the winner . wang chen and lu shanglei both lost a game in which they had played no moves . they agreed to a draw without play at the 2009 zhejiang lishui xingqiu cup international open chess tournament held in lishui , zhejiang province , china . the chief arbiter declared both players to have lost the game . susan polgar daily chess news and information , double forfeit ( based on polgar 's translation of chinese-language sina sports , published september 21 , 2009 ) . retrieved on 2009-09-29 . more rarely , a player might decide to protest by resigning a game rather than forfeiting . a game between fischer and oscar panno , played at the palma de mallorca interzonal 1970 , went : 1.c4 black resigns . panno refused to play to protest the organizers ' rescheduling of the game to accommodate fischer 's desire not to play on his religion 's shabbat . panno was not present when the game was to begin . fischer waited ten minutes before making his move and went to get panno to convince him to play . fifty-two minutes had elapsed on panno 's clock before he came to the board and resigned . ( at the time , an absence of sixty minutes resulted in a forfeit . ) the shortest decisive tournament game that was decided because of the position on the board ( i.e . not because of a forfeit or protest ) is z . đorđević–m . kovačević , bela crkva 1984 . it lasted only three moves ( 1.d4 nf6 2.bg5 c6 3.e3 qa5+ winning the bishop ) , and white resigned . this was repeated in vassallo–gamundi , salamanca 1998 . ( in a number of other games , white has played on after 3.qa5+ , occasionally drawing tim krabbé , entry no . 257 . retrieved on may 4 , 2009 . or even winning in this line . ) the shortest game ever lost by a grandmaster because of the position on the board was by future world champion viswanathan anand , who resigned on move 6 against alonso zapata in 1988 ( 1.e4 e5 2.nf3 nf6 3.nxe5 d6 4.nf3 nxe4 5.nc3 bf5 ? ? 6.qe2 winning a piece , since 6.qe7 is answered by 7.nd5 qe6 8.nxc7+ ) . . shortest draw . a game may be drawn by mutual agreement in any number of moves . traditionally , it has been common for players to agree to a '' grandmaster draw '' after playing about 10–15 moves of known opening theory and making no serious effort to win . this is usually done to preserve energy in a tournament , after a devastating loss in the previous round of the tournament , or in the final round when no prize money is at stake . there has been some debate over the ethics of the practice , and recently there has been a trend away from such games , with many tournaments adopting measures to discourage short draws . if the tournament officials ( unlike those at graz and lishui ) do not object , a game may even be agreed drawn without a single move being played . according to chessgames.com , in the 1968 skopje–ohrid tournament dragoljub janosevic and efim geller agreed to a draw without playing any moves . tony miles and stewart reuben did the same thing in the last round of the luton 1975 tournament , '' with the blessing of the controller '' , in order to assure themselves of first and second places respectively . . shortest world championship game . as mentioned above , fischer ( in 1972 ) and kramnik ( in 2006 ) each forfeited a world championship game without playing any moves . other than those unplayed games , the shortest game in a world championship was the 21st match game in the world chess championship 1963 between mikhail botvinnik and tigran petrosian . the players agreed to a draw after the 10th move by white ( petrosian ) . the shortest decisive , non-forfeited world championship game occurred between viswanathan anand and boris gelfand in game 8 of
