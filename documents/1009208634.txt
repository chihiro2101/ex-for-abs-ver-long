Sunrise

terminology . '' rise '' . although the sun appears to '' rise '' from the horizon , it is actually the earth 's motion that causes the sun to appear . the illusion of a moving sun results from earth observers being in a rotating reference frame ; this apparent motion is so convincing that many cultures had mythologies and religions built around the geocentric model , which prevailed until astronomer nicolaus copernicus formulated his heliocentric model in the 16th century . the earth is the center of the universe : top 10 science mistakes architect buckminster fuller proposed the terms '' sunsight '' and '' sunclipse '' to better represent the heliocentric model , though the terms have not entered into common language . beginning and end . astronomically , sunrise occurs for only an instant : the moment at which the upper limb of the sun appears tangent to the horizon . however , the term sunrise commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point : twilight , the period in the morning during which the sky is brightening , but the sun is not yet visible . the beginning of morning twilight is called astronomical dawn . the period after the sun rises during which striking colors and atmospheric effects are still seen . . measurement . angle . the stage of sunrise known as false sunrise actually occurs before the sun truly reaches the horizon because earth 's atmosphere refracts the sun 's image . at the horizon , the average amount of refraction is 34 arcminutes , though this amount varies based on atmospheric conditions . also , unlike most other solar measurements , sunrise occurs when the sun 's upper limb , rather than its center , appears to cross the horizon . the apparent radius of the sun at the horizon is 16 arcminutes . these two angles combine to define sunrise to occur when the sun 's center is 50 arcminutes below the horizon , or 90.83Â° from the zenith . . time of day . the timing of sunrise varies throughout the year and is also affected by the viewer 's latitude and longitude , altitude , and time zone . these changes are driven by the axial tilt of earth , daily rotation of the earth , the planet 's movement in its annual ellipse orbit around the sun , and the earth and moon 's paired revolutions around each other . the analemma can be used to make approximate predictions of the time of sunrise . in late winter and spring , sunrise as seen from temperate latitudes occurs earlier each day , reaching its earliest time near the summer solstice ; although the exact date varies by latitude . after this point , the time of sunrise gets later each day , reaching its latest sometime around the winter solstice . the offset between the dates of the solstice and the earliest or latest sunrise time is caused by the eccentricity of earth 's orbit and the tilt of its axis , and is described by the analemma , which can be used to predict the dates . variations in atmospheric refraction can alter the time of sunrise by changing its apparent position . near the poles , the time-of-day variation is exaggerated , since the sun crosses the horizon at a very shallow angle and thus rises more slowly . accounting for atmospheric refraction and measuring from the leading edge slightly increases the average duration of day relative to night . the sunrise equation , however , which is used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset , uses the sun 's physical center for calculation , neglecting atmospheric refraction and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc . location on the horizon . neglecting the effects of refraction and the sun 's non-zero size , whenever sunrise occurs , in temperate regions it is always in the northeast quadrant from the march equinox to the september equinox and in the southeast quadrant from the september equinox to the march equinox . sunrises occur approximately due east on the march and september equinoxes for all viewers on earth . exact calculations of the azimuths of sunrise on other dates are complex , but they can be estimated with reasonable accuracy by using the analemma . appearance . right right . colors . right air molecules and aerosol scatter white sunlight as it passes through the earth 's atmosphere . this is done by a combination of rayleigh scattering and mie scattering . as a ray of white sunlight travels through the atmosphere to an observer , some of the colors are scattered out of the beam by air molecules and airborne particles , changing the final color of the beam the viewer sees . because the shorter wavelength components , such as blue and green , scatter more strongly , these colors are preferentially removed from the beam . at sunrise and sunset , when the path through the atmosphere is longer , the blue and green components are removed almost completely leaving the longer wavelength orange and red hues seen at those times . the remaining reddened sunlight can then be scattered by cloud droplets and other relatively large particles to light up the horizon red and orange . the removal of the shorter wavelengths of light is due to rayleigh scattering by air molecules and particles much smaller than the wavelength of visible light ( less than 50 & nbsp ; nm in diameter ) . craig bohren ( ed . ) , selected papers on scattering in the atmosphere , spie optical engineering press , bellingham , wa , 1989 the scattering by cloud droplets and other particles with diameters comparable to or larger than the sunlight 's wavelengths ( more than 600 & nbsp ; nm ) is due to mie theory and is not strongly wavelength-dependent . mie scattering is responsible for the light scattered by clouds , and also for the daytime halo of white light around the sun ( forward scattering of white light ) . sunset colors are typically more brilliant than sunrise colors , because the evening air contains more particles than morning air . right ash from volcanic eruptions , trapped within the troposphere , tends to mute sunset and sunrise colors , while volcanic ejecta that is instead lofted into the stratosphere ( as thin clouds of tiny sulfuric acid droplets ) , can yield beautiful post-sunset colors called afterglows and pre-sunrise glows . a number of eruptions , including those of mount pinatubo in 1991 and krakatoa in 1883 , have produced sufficiently high stratospheric sulfuric acid clouds to yield remarkable sunset afterglows ( and pre-sunrise glows ) around the world . the high altitude clouds serve to reflect strongly reddened sunlight still striking the stratosphere after sunset , down to the surface . optical illusions and other phenomena . image : false sunrise.jpg thumb right this is a false sunrise , a very particular kind of parhelion atmospheric refraction causes the sun to be seen while it is still below the horizon . light from the lower edge of the sun 's disk is refracted more than light from the upper edge . this reduces the apparent height of the sun when it appears just above the horizon . the width is not affected , so the sun appears wider than it is high . the sun appears larger at sunrise than it does while higher in the sky , in a manner similar to the moon illusion . the sun appears to rise above the horizon and circle the earth , but it is actually the earth that is rotating , with the sun remaining fixed . this effect results from the fact that an observer on earth is in a rotating reference frame . occasionally a false sunrise occurs , demonstrating a very particular kind of parhelion belonging to the optical phenomenon family of halos . sometimes just before sunrise or after sunset a green flash can be seen . this is an optical phenomenon in which a green spot is visible above the sun , usually for no more than a second or two .
