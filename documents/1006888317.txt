Dividend tax

history . in most jurisdictions , dividends from corporations are treated as a type of income and taxed accordingly at the individual level . many jurisdictions have adopted special treatment of dividends , imposing a separate rate on dividends to wage income or capital gains . in the united states , the revenue act of 1913 and 16th amendment created a personal income tax of 1 % with additional surtaxes of 1-5 % , and exempted dividends from the general income tax but not the surtaxes which applied above the 20,000 level . this was to avoid the double taxation of income as there was a 1 % corporate tax as well . after 1936 , dividends were again subject to the ordinary income tax , but from 1954-1983 there were various exemptions and credits , taxing dividends at a lower rate . the 2003 tax cuts created a new category of qualified dividend that was taxed at the lower long-term capital gains rate instead of the ordinary income rate . . collection . in many jurisdictions , companies are subject to withholding tax of a prescribed rate , paying this to the national revenue authorities and paying to shareholders only the balance of the dividend . controversy . taxation of dividends is controversial , based on the issues of double taxation . depending on the jurisdiction , dividends may be treated as '' unearned income '' ( like interest and collected rents ) and thus liable for income tax . arguments in favor . a corporation is a legal entity separate from its shareholders with a '' life '' of its own . as a separate entity , a corporation has the right to use public goods as an individual does , and is therefore obligated to help pay for the public goods through taxes . double taxation of dividends : is the question resolved ? by novella clevenger and ken pfannenstiel published in new accountant magazine . professor confidence w . amadi of west georgia university has argued : once it is established that a corporation is , for all important purposes , a separate legal entity , the issue becomes how transfers from one legal entity ( corporations ) to another legal entity ( shareholders ) should be taxed , not whether the money should be taxed . it can be argued that it is unfair and economically unproductive , to tax earned income at a higher rate than unearned income . arguments against . critics , such as the cato institute , argue that a dividend tax is an unfair '' double taxation '' . cato 's position is : soon after , congress passed the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 ( jgtrra ) , which included some of the cuts bush requested and which he signed into law on may 28 , 2003 . under the new law , qualified dividends are taxed at the same rate as long-term capital gains , which is 15 percent for most individual taxpayers . qualified dividends received by individuals in the 10 % and 15 % income tax brackets were taxed at 5 % from 2003 to 2007 . the qualified dividend tax rate was set to expire december 31 , 2008 ; however , the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 ( tipra ) extended the lower tax rate through 2010 and further cut the tax rate on qualified dividends to 0 % for individuals in the 10 % and 15 % income tax brackets . on december 17 , 2010 , president barack obama signed into law the tax relief , unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 . the legislation extends for two additional years the changes enacted to the taxation of dividends in the jgtrra and tipra .

related theory-modigliani-miller 's dividend irrelevance . financial management theories call much debate on how dividend policies affect corporate values . there is a mixture of claims that the value of a company increases as it increases its dividend payments and claims that the value of a company decreases . it is a theory that even the dividend policy is irrelevant to the value of the company . they asserted that dividend policies are basically meaningless because they have no effect on corporate values under the control of the entire capital market . however , this theory has a problem that it is based on unrealistic assumptions . corporate dividend policy is a very important issue for shareholders , as most countries treat dividends and capital gains differently in income tax . in many countries , ordinary income tax rates are applied for dividends , while far lower tax rates apply for capital gains . this means that the tax authorities are imposing some sort of dividend penalty on the payment of dividends , so shareholders prefer a relatively light tax burden to an in-house reservation . despite this existence of dividend penalties , many companies have chosen a significantly higher dividend rate , which is contradictory to their theoretical expectations ( dividend puzzle ) . although numerous studies have been done to solve the mystery of dividends , they have yet to get clear answers . see also . corporate tax company shareholder taxation passive income estate tax ( united states ) state income tax double taxation taxation in the united states withholding tax .
