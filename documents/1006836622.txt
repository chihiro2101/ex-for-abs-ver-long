Ath

history . pre–1500 . archeological records show the existence of several gallo-roman settlements in the ath area . the origin of the city of ath , however , dates from around 1160 , when count baudouin iv of hainaut , bought some territory from his liegeman , gilles de trazegnies . a few years later , baldwin built the burbant tower & ndash ; which can still be seen today & ndash ; to protect his new acquisition . the new city was soon given privileges and its newly built ( 1325 ) market hall on the grand-place began to attract residents . ath was the setting of the '' peace of ath '' , signed on june4 , 1357 , to end the question of the brabant succession . by then , the weekly ath market , which took place & ndash ; and still takes place & ndash ; on thursdays , had started attracting sellers from a much larger region . the production of linen , cloth , hide , and luxury items such as gold ware , cabinets , and sculptures was growing fast . the population growth necessitated the building of a second wall , which was completed at the end of the 14th century . in 1416 , the city built a school for the study of latin , which justus lipsius attended . the city counted then about 5,000 people . 1501–present . in 1667 , ath was conquered in a single day by the army of louis xiv and became the first france city of the spanish netherlands . soon after , vauban built new fortifications , which included eight bastions . the city suffered again at the hands of the french army in 1745 . at the end of the 18th century , ath counted about 7,300 inhabitants but the population count decreased in the first half of the 19th century . in 1816 , two military engineering surveys concluded that ath defences should be improved , the british survey recommended a garrison of 3,000 troops and the building cost would be £143,599 . the dutch wished to spend an additional £266,000 . the duke of wellington agreed to the dutch plan . the funding was paid for by england ( 30 % ) , holland ( 30 % ) and by french war reparations ( 40 % ) . in 1824 , the dutch under king william i , built the féron fort , and the city once more gained strategic value . a treaty drafted in london on 15 november 1831 , which the netherlands refused to sign , was followed by the treaty of london ( 1839 ) , which created the kingdom of belgium . part of the terms of the treaty required the fort , amongst others , to be dismantled . the freed up land assisted the town for the activities of a growing population . a new growth period took place between 1850 and 1914 driven by the forestry , agricultural ( breweries , mills ) and textile industries . in the 20th century , most of these industries went into decline and were replaced by commercial , administrative and educational activities . in the last 30 years , several neighbourhoods have been revitalized and developed , and the city 's monuments renovated or restored . july 30 , 2004 explosions . the ghislenghien industrial park near ath was the scene of one of belgium 's worst ever industrial disasters on july 30 , 2004 . around 8:30 & nbsp ; am local time , workers constructing a new factory for abrasives firm diamant boart ( a subsidiary of the electrolux ) reported a strong smell of gas . it is believed the gas was escaping from a high-pressure underground pipeline conveying natural gas from zeebrugge to france , operated by gas transportation company fluxys . firefighters were soon on the scene and were attempting to clear the area when at least two explosions occurred at around 9:00 & nbsp ; am . the strongest of these demolished the partly built diamant boart structure , and fires were started in several other buildings . the official death-toll has risen to 23 , with over 120 injured . five volunteer firemen and one police officer were among the dead . the cause of the leak has not yet been ascertained . after the explosion , signs of damage by a construction machine were discovered on the exploded part of the pipeline and the adjacent parts . probably these were the result of construction works a few weeks before the explosion . the pipeline probably ruptured completely on july 30 , 2004 , when operator fluxys raised the pressure . sights . the 12th-century burbant tower was built by baudouin iv and named after the neighbouring landgraviate of brabant . the town hall dates from the 17th century . the church of saint julien , rebuilt after a fire in the 19th century , still keeps a gothic tower and apsidal chapel , as well as a famous 16th-century carillon . the church of saint martin and the exterior oak calvary both date from the 16th century . festivities . the “ ducasse ” originated from a yearly procession developed in the 15th century ( first mentioned in 1399 ) as a celebration of the consecration of the local saint julien church . this procession illustrated stories from the old testament , new testament , golden legend , and carolingian cycle . today , the “ ducasse ” is a very popular celebration that includes various festivities and lasts several days spanning the end of august and beginning of september . the highlight is the cortege of giants ( in french : cortège des géants ) , with david and goliath as the most famous characters . the ducasse is listed among the masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity . transportation . ath is located along the n56 road . people born in ath . arnold caussin , born about 1510 . musician , composer . student in the university of cracow in 1526 . henri musielak , revue de musicologie , t . 62 , n° 2 , paris 1976 , p . 308 . michael baius , theologian julien-joseph ducorron , painter ( 1770–1848 ) eugène defacqz , politician ( 1797–1871 ) jean taisner , priest and scientist ( 16th century ) louis hennepin , catholic priest and missionary , and explorer of the interior of north america ( 17th century ) . fanny heldy , opera soprano ( 19th century ) joseph jules descamps , politician ( 1820–1892 ) . ernest f . cambier , belgian colonial pioneer ( 1844–1921 ) henri vernes , novelist ( 20th century ) guy spitaels , politician ( 20th century ) olivier dupuis , politician ( 20th century ) pierre descamps , politician ( 20th century ) anders tang , humorist ( 20th century ) julian the hospitaller , legendary saint , was according to one tradition born in ath jacques de saint-luc , lutenist and composer ( 1616 – c . 1710 ) . references . external links . cercle royal d'histoire et d'archéologie d'ath et de la région et musées athois , an exhaustive list of references on the history of the ath region , in french . official site of the city , in french , dutch , and english . the ducasse of ath , in french . awarded '' eden - european destinations of excellence '' non traditional tourist destination 2008
