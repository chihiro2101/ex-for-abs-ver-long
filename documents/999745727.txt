however , as the troupe became more popular , they frequently travelled throughout the country to record their weekly radio broadcasts , which featured a mixture of political and cultural satire . the farce troupe recorded a one-hour television special in 1980 , which evolved into a ten-week series and two sequel specials . they continued to perform their radio series as the tv series and specials moved forward . many of the tv show 's sketches were actually performed as '' radio sketches '' —during filming , air farce cast members stood on stage in front of microphones reading from scripts , whilst sound effects technician alex sinclair could be seen on stage adding sound effects as needed . other sketches , some quite elaborate , were acted out in full costume as more traditional television sketches . despite the decent ratings for the initial special , the tv series was received with somewhat lukewarm reviews and ratings . the air farce left television after a special in 1984 . in the early 1980s , air farce 's summer radio hiatus periods were filled by another comedy troupe , the frantics , who later moved on to their own tv series , four on the floor . later summer hiatus periods , however , were filled by ferguson and abbott playing classic comedy recordings . in the late 1980s , cbc radio launched another 30-minutes weekly political satire , double exposure . though the programmes were never in direct competition , some found the latter show fresher and edgier . in 1992 , air farce took a second plunge into television with 1992 : year of the farce , a satirical new year 's eve special . for this and all subsequent tv appearances , the troupe abandoned the idea of performing tv sketches as '' radio sketches '' , and presented their tv work in a traditional tv sketch show format . a ratings smash , the special led the troupe to produce another weekly television series , which debuted in 1993 . however , this time the move to television was permanent . the radio series continued alongside the tv show for four seasons until may 1997 , when it was discontinued . the practice of having a new year 's eve special continued through the show 's entire run , and such episodes were typically titled year of the farce . air farce also frequently had the honour of counting down the seconds before the new year on cbc , and the show 's final episode was itself a new year 's eve special . recurring characters on the tv series included the slow albertan mike from canmore ( morgan ) and angry scot jock mcbile ( morgan ) , self-righteous movie critic gilbert smythe bite-me ( abbott ) , and chain-smoking bingo player brenda ( goy ) . though these characters would occasionally feature in skits of their own , usually they were used at the beginning of the show to deliver a stream of one liner jokes commentating on the news of that week . the show also featured frequent skits with politicians , who were portrayed as various extreme caricatures of their most infamous personality quirks . notable re-occurring figures included prime minister jean chrétien ( abbott ) , who could barely speak a single sentence of english without committing at least a dozen outlandish pronunciation and grammatical errors , the nasally-voiced preston manning ( ferguson ) who loved to shout '' refooooooorm ! '' , a screaming , bitchy sheila copps ( goy ) , the tyrannical lucien bouchard , the dopey and overly-image conscious stockwell day , the strutting , clucking , pompous joe clark , and the power-hungry paul martin ( all ferguson ) . many of the real politicians also made guest appearances on the show , often interacting directly with their parodic counterparts . however , colonel '' teresa '' stacy ( ferguson ) quickly emerged as the show 's most popular character — each time he appeared , stacy would load up the chicken cannon and fire rubber chickens and other assorted projectiles at whomever he deemed the most annoying public figure of the week ( or year ) . morgan retired from air farce in 2001 , and the remaining three members carried on with a rotating stable of guest stars ( usually no more than one per episode ) . seen frequently as '' special guests '' from 2001-2003 were rochelle wilson , jessica holmes , sean cullen , peter keleghan , janet van de graaff , james roussel , craig lauzon and elvira kurt . holmes ' appearances became more frequent as time went by , especially by the beginning of the 2003-04 season . in december 2003 , she officially joined the show , adding celebrity figures such as paris hilton and liza minnelli , and canadian politicians such as belinda stronach , to the troupe 's roster of characters . later , in 2005 , after a lockout at cbc , air farce gained two new cast members , who had previously appeared on the show as recurring guest stars : alan park and craig lauzon . the addition of these two newcomers brought the total number of performers in the troupe to six . while the show was widely regarded as a canadian institution , some critics have felt that the television show 's quality has diminished over the past few seasons , especially since the breakdown of the original four-actor quartet . however , it still continued to draw solid ratings each week . on march 30 , 2007 , the air farce celebrated their 300th episode by doing the show on live television ( except in western canada ) for one hour . roger abbott and luba goy began the show with a brief history of the show , closing with '' the scariest three words on television : air farce live ! '' . after this experimental episode , cbc announced that the 15th season of the series would be aired live for the entire season , with a name change to air farce live . the final season retained its live format , but was renamed as air farce : final flight . . end of series . thumb air farce remained popular through its radio run and initially as a tv series , but over the years interest in the show began to drop and its ratings fell . on april 1 , 2008 , the cbc and air farce announced that air farce live would end in the 2008/2009 season . nine new shows , titled air farce—final flight ! aired from october 3 , 2008 , to december 5 , 2008 , with the new year 's eve special as the tenth show and series finale . a special feature of the final season of shows was '' air farce flashback '' , featuring a memorable segment from the previous 15 seasons of the air farce series . the new year 's eve grand finale featured in the air farce flashback segment highlights from several segments of air farce sketches over the years . the final hour-long episode aired december 31 , 2008 , at 8:00 pm eastern time . it featured special guests ron maclean , peter mansbridge , and former air farce member dave broadfoot . the final episode was viewed by over 1.5 million viewers . . specials . in december 2009 , it was announced that the air farce would return for a new year 's eve 2009 special , featuring the return of most of the original staff ( excluding jessica holmes , gord holtham , and rick olsen ) , guest appearances by peter mansbridge , battle of the blades winners jamie salé and craig simpson , and the dragons of dragons ' den . the special also featured the successor to the chicken cannon , '' f-bombs , '' which were dropped onto photographs from the top of the atrium of the canadian broadcasting centre . on december 16–17 , 2010 , the royal canadian air farce 2010 new year special was taped . it aired december 31 , 2010 . the cast included jessica holmes , who returned for the 60 minute show as yogi gurt and celine dion . the 2011 year-end special , '' air farce not the new year 's eve special '' aired january 1 , 2012 , due to several hockey games scheduled new year 's eve . jessica holmes did not return for this special due to a prior commitment . this was the first air farce special that did not feature the late roger abbott in its cast , who had died earlier in 2011 . in 2017 , a canada day special aired , in celebration of the 150th anniversary of confederation , as well as a year-end special . while ratings for the specials remained strong , drawing over a million viewers in 2017 and 2018 , the cbc informed the troupe in may 2019 that due to budgetary constraints , the 2019 year-end special will be the final edition in the series . it is to be a farewell show combining new material looking at 2019 in review and archival material from the troupe 's past , including clips of deceased members roger abbott and john morgan . . sketches . recurring sketches . some of the recurring sketches on air farce include : '' ad absurdum '' , where goy remarks on the terrible commercials aired on canadian television .

'' brenda the bingo lady '' , where a middle-aged woman ( goy ) vents her opinions about current issues while playing a game of bingo alongside her husband ( abbott ) . each sketch often invariably ends with the husband , who is named sid , winning , despite playing only one bingo card to brenda 's numerous cards . '' b.s . 2000 '' , where the cast of air farce portray various particular canadian newspeople as they put their spin on the 2000 federal election . at the end of a sketch , they would '' poll '' the public ( another cast member playing an anonymous canadian ) and give its results , the gag being that only one person was polled in the survey ( and thus one leader would get 100 % of the votes , but on one occasion the person abstained ) . '' chicken cannon '' . although originally a sketch in the early parts of air farce on tv meant to satirize the canadian military ( in it , the canadian military consists of only two people , colonel '' teresa '' stacy and his assistant , played by ferguson and morgan ) , but as the popularity of the sketch grew , it became an integral part of air farce , spawning its own newsroom sketch titled '' chicken cannon news '' . studio audience members or viewers at home nominate or vote for their favourite target along with their choice of ammunition ( not necessarily a chicken ) . the cast picks a winner and fires the chicken cannon at the fan-suggested target at the end of the sketch . the fan also wins some form of air farce merchandise for having their choice be a chicken cannon target . in the '' year of the farce '' episodes , a special version of the chicken cannon has the top five targets of the year , with the first four being fired upon by a rubber chicken while the top target being fired as before . past targets included : canadian party leaders jean chrétien , stockwell day , alexa mcdonough , gilles duceppe , and joe clark , for the 2000 election olympic figure skating judges , for their part in the scandal that had surrounded jamie salé and david pelletier in the 2002 winter olympics george w . bush and al gore , for the scandal that surrounded the 2000 us presidential election gary bettman and bob goodenow , for the furor that resulted from the 2004–05 nhl lockout harry potter ben johnson alexei yashin pikachu from pokémon ricky martin britney spears canadian idol host ben mulroney former mayor of toronto mel lastman for being a '' bad boy '' former ceo of air canada robert milton then-ontario premier dalton mcguinty marty mcsorley for being suspended after assaulting by hockey stick in 2000 , the only target where colonel stacy attacks with hockey stick . osama bin laden , for his involvement with the september 11 attacks . note that this is the only known target where colonel stacey loads the chicken cannon himself . paul martin and stephen harper for their unprofessional behaviour over the past year of 2005 the y2k bug frank and gordon , animated beavers used as advertising mascots for bell canada then-canadian environment minister rona ambrose ( for '' messing up the environment '' ) former edmonton oiler chris pronger for being a '' turncoat '' karlheinz schreiber and brian mulroney were a tie in 2007 . joe biden and sarah palin don cherry as requested by ron maclean when he was a guest in 2008 . john baird stephen harper 's house ( for not turning off his lights during earth hour . ) patrick and jonathan roy stephen harper , stéphane dion , michael ignatieff , jack layton , and gilles duceppe for the 2008–2009 canadian parliamentary dispute . the cbc for cancelling the air farce series and for losing the rights to the the hockey theme to ctv '' critic at large '' , where gilbert smythe bite-me ( abbott ) , an entertainment critic , gives negative reviews , and takes regular potshots at the w network , describing them as ' a bunch of scrotally-deprived , estrogen-sodden non-males ' , and 'not just because three of ( his ) ex-wives work there . ' '' sister bessie '' . sister bessie ( holmes ) is a catholic nun commenting on various political topics either in the house of commons or relating to outside sources like george w . bush . the issues usually make her angry , causing her network vision tv to block out any obscenities that she may say during her broadcast . '' craig oliver 's 3-way '' ( abbott ) talks recent news and events with opinions from three other panel members . '' dave the cabbie '' , where dave ( ferguson ) , a cab driver , takes on a fare and proceeds to converse with them on various current events . dave demands that the fare pay in cash and not with the visa credit card ( often with the line '' you pay cash , no visa . you pay visa i kill you . '' ) he also pronounces the i in visa with a hard i ( v-eye-za ) and not a soft i ( v-ee-za ) as is usually the case . the cabbie also often takes the passenger somewhere other than requested and then demands an outrageous price . for a famous celebrity 's death , dave says '' it 's very sad about fred rogers . he imitates rogers saying , '' not a beautiful day in the neighbourhood . '' although he has a thick ukraine accent , he claims to be originally from regina ( the '' flat part '' ) . although he usually speaks the most , when the client leaves he claims that '' ( he ) thought that ( the client ) would never shut up . '' '' english as a second language news '' , hosted by heikki flergenpootz ( abbott ) and svetlana ( goy ) . the sketch is a typical newsroom sketch , often peppered with mistakes that typical esl learners make . in later years , they typically said '' goodbye '' at the beginning of the sketch and '' hello '' at the end . each sketch also included a third '' guest commentator '' portrayed by ferguson , some of which would later get their own sketches . '' get stuffed '' , in which jock mcbile ( morgan ) , a scottish-canadian left-handed bagpipe repair man , put his spin on current events . '' i love that word refoooorm '' , in which preston manning ( ferguson , although manning himself has appeared in the sketch playing ferguson 's role ) , promotes his party , with comical results . manning was frequently accompanied by various guests ( most often morgan as deborah grey , deputy leader of the party , although grey herself has been a guest ) who criticize manning on his speech . manning ended the sketch with the phrase '' i love that word reform '' , with '' reform '' being drawn out for comedic effect . '' knob of the week '' , a sketch in the style of the chicken cannon '' honouring '' various acts of stupidity by various groups . it was introduced partially to replace the chicken cannon , which was specially reserved for the year of the farce show and possibly the season opener ( both of which were one-hour shows compared to the regular 30-minute shows ) . '' man 's world '' with buck mcsweeney ( ferguson ) . typically , ferguson is joined by a special guest star ( most often an athlete ) playing as themselves . buck proceeds to do a typical sports interview while letting his obsession with synchronized swimming be known . '' member for kicking horse pass '' , in which the fictional member of parliament ( dave broadfoot ) , reprising his original radio role , performs a solo comedy sketch ( as a representative of the '' new apathetic party '' . ) '' news from away '' with jimmy and seamus o'toole ( abbott and ferguson ) . another newsroom sketch where abbott and ferguson play newscasters from newfoundland . there are a number of sketches-within-a-sketch interspersed throughout , common ones being : '' 52 weeks in 52 seconds '' , in which jimmy and seamus rapid fire various one-liners based on events that occurred in the past year . it is typically a part of every year of the farce show . '' point-counterpoint '' , in which jimmy and seamus try to debate an issue from different points of view . however , one starts the argument and the other agrees on the spot . '' seamus ' commentary '' , where seamus makes a one-line commentary about one particular issue . in one sketch , he delivered his commentary in the style of a rick mercer streeter from this hour has 22 minutes , and mercer himself showed up mid-sketch to correct seamus ' delivery style . during the show 's live 300th episode , alan park played the role of seamus , because the last sketch had don ferguson doing his rex murphy impersonation , accompanied by mary walsh who did her famous character , marg : princess warrior .

'' speedvision news '' , a newsroom sketch ( purportedly on the speedvision television channel ) where two anchors ( abbott and ferguson ) speak quickly while recalling current events . similar sketches also lampoon rogers sportsnet 's and the score 's news programmes ( sportsnetnews and score tonight ) , where holmes and ferguson play the roles of the anchors ( holmes plays either jody vance or martine gaillard , while it is unclear which sportscaster ferguson is playing ) . '' liberal and pc '' a spoof of the get a mac , park plays a liberal ( parody of the mac ) and lauzon plays a '' pc '' ( progressive conservative ) and follows the outline of the mac ad .
