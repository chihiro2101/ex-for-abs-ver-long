Cliff

etymology . cliff comes from the old english word clif of essentially the same meaning , cognate with dutch , low german , and old norse klif 'cliff' . oxford english dictionary , 1971 these may in turn all be from a romance loanword into primitive germanic that has its origins in the latin forms ( '' slope '' or '' hillside '' ) . monika buchmüller-pfaff : namen im grenzland - methoden ,

cliffs . given that a cliff does not need to be exactly vertical , there can be ambiguity about whether a given slope is a cliff or not and also about how much of a certain slope to count as a cliff . for example , given a truly vertical rock wall above a very steep slope , one could count just the rock wall or the combination . listings of cliffs are thus inherently uncertain . some of the largest cliffs on earth are found underwater . for example , an 8,000 m drop over a 4,250 m span can be found at a ridge sitting inside the kermadec trench . the highest very steep non-vertical cliffs in the world are nanga parbat 's rupal face and gyala peri 's southeast face , which both rise approximately 4,600 m , or 15,000 ft , above their base . according to other sources , the highest cliff in the world , about 1,340 m high , is the east face of great trango in the karakoram mountains of northern pakistan . this uses a fairly stringent notion of cliff , as the 1,340 m figure refers to a nearly vertical headwall of two stacked pillars ; adding in a very steep approach brings the total drop from the east face precipice to the nearby dunge glacier to nearly 2,000 m . the location of the world 's highest sea cliffs depends also on the definition of 'cliff ' that is used . guinness world records states it is kalaupapa , hawaii , at 1,010 m high . another contender is the north face of mitre peak , which drops 1,683 m to milford sound , new zealand . these are subject to a less stringent definition , as the average slope of these cliffs at kaulapapa is about 1.7 , corresponding to an angle of 60 degrees , and mitre peak is similar . a more vertical drop into the sea can be found at maujit qaqarssuasia ( also known as the 'thumbnail ' ) which is situated in the torssukátak fjord area at the very tip of south greenland and drops 1,560 m near-vertically . considering a truly vertical drop , mount thor on baffin island in arctic canada is often considered the highest at 1370 & nbsp ; m ( 4500 & nbsp ; ft ) high in total ( the top 480 & nbsp ; m ( 1600 & nbsp ; ft ) is overhanging ) , and is said to give it the longest vertical drop on earth at 1,250 m ( 4,100 & nbsp ; ft ) . however , other cliffs on baffin island , such as polar sun spire in the sam ford fjord , or others in remote areas of greenland may be higher . the highest cliff in the solar system may be verona rupes , an approximately high fault scarp on miranda , a moon of uranus . list . the following is an incomplete list of cliffs of the world . asia . above sea ra 's sajir , oman , above the arabian

regarded , together with ethiopia 's simien mountains , as one of the two finest erosional mountain ranges on earth . because of their near-unique geological formation , the range has an extraordinarily high percentage of cliff faces making up its length , particularly along the highest portion of the range . this portion of the range is virtually uninterrupted cliff faces , ranging from to in height for almost . of all , the '' drakensberg amphitheatre '' ( mentioned above ) is most well known . other notable cliffs include the trojan wall , cleft peak , injisuthi triplets ,
