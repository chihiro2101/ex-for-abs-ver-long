Morris Swadesh

early life and education . swadesh was born in 1909 in holyoke , massachusetts , to jewish immigrant parents from bessarabia . his parents were multilingual , and he grew up with yiddish , some russian , and english as his first languages . swadesh earned his b.a . and m.a . from the university of chicago , where he began studying with the linguist edward sapir . he followed sapir to yale university , where he earned his ph.d . in 1933 . inspired by sapir 's early lists of word similarities among native american languages , he began a life work in comparative linguistics . early career . in the 1930s , swadesh conducted extensive fieldwork on more than 20 indigenous languages of the americas , with travels in canada , mexico , and the us . he worked most prominently on the chitimacha language , a now-extinct language isolate found among indigenous people of louisiana . his fieldnotes and subsequent publications constitute the main source of information on this extinct language . he also conducted smaller amounts of fieldwork on the menominee and mahican languages , in wisconsin and new york , respectively ; both are part of the algonquian languages . swadesh taught linguistics and anthropology at the university of wisconsin–madison from 1937 to 1939 . during this time he devised and organized the highly original '' oneida language and folklore project . '' this program hired more than a dozen oneida tribe in wisconsin for a wpa project ( under the franklin d . roosevelt administration ) to record and translate texts in the oneida language . ( the oneida were historically one of the five nations of the iroquois confederacy , with their historic territory located in central new york state , but some had moved to wisconsin in the 19th century . ) in this same period in other wpa projects , writers were recording state histories and guides , and researchers were collecting oral histories of african americans who had been born into slavery before the end of the civil war . swadesh was let go by the university of wisconsin just as he was to begin the project . floyd lounsbury , then an undergraduate , was assigned to finish it . lounsbury continued his studies in linguistics , later serving as sterling professor of anthropology and linguistics at yale university . in may 1939 swadesh went to mexico , where he had been hired to assist the government of mexican president lázaro cárdenas , who was promoting the education of indigenous peoples . swadesh learned the purépecha language for this work . together with rural school teachers , swadesh worked in indigenous villages , teaching people to read first in their own languages , before teaching them spanish . he worked with the tarahumara , purépecha , and otomi peoples . swadesh also learned spanish in less than a year ; he was fluent enough that he was able to give a series of linguistics lectures ( in spanish ) at the universidad michoacana de san nicolás de hidalgo and publish his first book , '' la nueva filologia , '' in spanish in 1941 . obituary : morris swadesh , american anthropologist , vol . 70 , 1968 , returning to the u.s . , during the second world war swadesh worked on military projects for the u.s . army and the oss to compile reference materials on burmese , chinese , russian , and spanish . he also wrote easy-to-learn textbooks for troops to learn russian and chinese . swadesh served in burma , where lt . roger hilsman described his linguistic skills as extraordinary . swadesh learned enough of the naga language , after spending only one day with a local guide , that he was able to give a ten-minute thank-you speech in that language . roger hilsman , american guerrilla , potomac books , 2005 , pp . 142–143 hilsman recalled that swadesh had been strongly opposed to racial segregation in the united states . . red scare . in may 1949 , swadesh was fired by the city college of new york ( ccny ) due to accusations that he was a communist . that was during the red scare , and he was one of a number of anthropologists and other academics to be opposed by anticommunists during the mccarthy era . swadesh had been a member of the denver communist party and was active in the protest movement against the execution of convicted spies , julius and ethel rosenberg . david h . price .
