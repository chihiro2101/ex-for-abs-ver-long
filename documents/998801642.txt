the protecting veil , first performed by cellist steven isserlis and the london symphony orchestra at the 1989 proms ; and song for athene ( 1993 ) . the two choral works were settings of texts by mother thekla , a russian orthodox abbess who was tavener 's long-time spiritual adviser until her death in 2011 . song for athene in particular gained worldwide exposure when performed at the funeral of diana , princess of wales in 1997 . tavener 's fall and resurrection , first performed in 2000 , used instruments such as shofar , ney flute and kaval . it was dedicated to the prince of wales , with whom tavener formed a lasting friendship . in 2003 tavener composed the exceptionally large work the veil of the temple ( which was premièred at the temple church , london ) , based on texts from a number of religions . identified by tavener as '' the supreme achievement of my life '' , it is set for four choirs , several orchestras and soloists and lasts at least seven hours . prayer of the heart , written for and performed by björk , was premiered in 2004 . in 2007 tavener composed the beautiful names , a setting of the 99 names of god in the muslim tradition , sung in arabic . it had been reported , particularly in the british press , that tavener left orthodox christianity to explore a number of other different religious traditions , including hinduism and islam , and became a follower of the traditionalist philosopher frithjof schuon . : p . 30 . tavener is quoted as saying , '' it strikes me now that all religions are as senile as one another . '' in an interview with the new york times , conducted by british music journalist michael white , tavener said : '' i reached a point where everything i wrote was terribly austere and hidebound by the tonal system of the orthodox church , and i felt the need , in my music at least , to become more universalist : to take in other colors , other languages .
