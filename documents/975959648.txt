life . nicola abbagnano was born in salerno on 15 july 1901 . he was the first-born son of a middle-class professional family , his father was a practicing lawyer in the area . he studied in naples , and in november 1922 obtained a degree in philosophy , his thesis that became the subject of his first book le sorgenti irrazionali del pensiero ( 1923 ) . his mentor was antonio aliotta . in the following years he taught philosophy and history at the liceo umberto i° , in naples , and from 1917 to 1936 he was the professor of philosophy and pedagogy in the istituto di magistero suor orsola benincasa . at the same time he actively contributed as secretary of editorial staff to the review logos , edited by his mentor aliotta . from 1936 to 1976 he was a full professor of history of philosophy , and then in 1939 he was appointed to a full-time professorship at the faculty of letters and philosophy at the university of turin . immediately after world war ii he helped found the centro di studi metodologici in turin . with his student , franco ferrarotti , abbagnano founded in 1950 the quaderni di sociologia , and in 1952 he was joint editor with norberto bobbio of the rivista di filosofia . then from 1952 to 1960 he inspired a group of scholars for a '' new enlightenment , '' and organized a series of conventions attended by the philosophers who were engaged in the construction of a '' lay '' philosophy and who were interested in the main trends of the foreign philosophical thought . in 1964 he began his contributions to the turin newspaper la stampa . in 1972 he moved to milan and discontinued his contributions to la stampa , but began writing for indro montanelli 's giornale . in milan he held the office of town councillo , elected from the lists of the liberal party , and was also the councillor of culture . he died on 9 september 1990 , and was buried in the cemetery of santa margherita ligure , the riviera town where he had spent his vacations for many years . works . during the neapolitan period abbagnano 's theoretical work is represented by le sorgenti irrazionali del pensiero ( 1923 ) , as well as il problema dell'arte ( 1925 ) , la fisica nuova ( 1934 ) e il principio della metafisica ( 1936 ) . these works are all influenced by the teaching of aliotta , who encouraged abbagnano 's interest in the methodological problems of science . equally influential was the anti-idealist controversy that is particularly evident in his volume on art . after moving to turin , abbagnano turned to the study of existentialism , which by this time was also the interest of the general italian philosophical culture . he formulated an original version of existentialism in his widely recognized book , la struttura dell'esistenza ( 1939 ) , which was followed by his introduzione all'esistenzialismo ( 1942 ) and a set of essays collected in filosofia religione scienza ( 1947 ) and by esistenzialismo positivo ( 1948 ) . in 1943 he played a very important part in the debate on existentialism that appeared in primato , the review of the fascist opposition led by giuseppe bottai . in the first years after the war , abbagnano 's interest turned to american pragmatism , above all is the version offered by john dewey to the philosophy of science and to neopositivism . in existentialism , having freed himself from the negative implications he found in heidegger , in jaspers , in sartre , in dewey 's pragmatism and in neopositivism , abagnano saw the signs of a new philosophical trend , that he called a '' new enlightenment '' in an article written in 1948 . the development of this idea in the fifties was precisely characterized both by his interest in science , in particular , sociology , and by an attempt to define the program of a philosophy , that he first called a '' new enlightenment '' and later a '' methodological empirism '' . during this period essays were collected in possibilità e libertà ( 1956 ) and in problemi di sociologia ( 1959 ) but , one of his most important works is the dizionario di filosofia ( 1961 ) , a true '' summa '' meant to clarify the principal concepts of philosophy . besides the volumes and the essays on theoretical character , nicola abbagnano , since his youth he has published many historical monographs , including ; il nuovo idealismo inglese e americano ( 1927 ) , la filosofia di e . meyerson e la logica dell'identità ( 1929 ) , guglielmo d'ockham ( 1933 ) , la nozione del tempo secondo aristotele ( 1933 ) , bernardino telesio ( 1941 ) . his major historiographic work is found in the storia della filosofia published by utet ( 1946–1950 ) , which was preceded by the compendio di storia della filosofia ( 1945–1947 ) , which was closer to a textbook . a few years later the latter was followed by a collection entitled storia delle scienze , which he coordinated for utet ( 1962 ) . abbagnano 's defined his philosophy as '' positive existentialism '' . his '' philosophy of possible '' condemned other existentialists for either denying human possibility or exaggerating it . in his later work he tended to adopt a more naturalistic and scientific approach to philosophy . some of his writings were translated into english in critical existentialism ( ed . by nino langiulli , 1969 ) . his work in the last decades , starting from 1965 on , mainly consists of articles appearing in la stampa and in giornale that were later assembled in different collections , per o contro l'uomo ( 1968 ) , fra il tutto e il nulla ( 1973 ) , questa pazza filosofia ( 1979 ) , l'uomo progetto duemila ( 1980 ) , la saggezza della vita ( 1985 ) , la saggezza della filosofia ( 1987 ) . his last book , written a few months before his death , is the autobiographical text ricordi di un filosofo ( 1990 ) . selected bibliography . le sorgenti irrazionali del pensiero , napoli , 1923 il problema dell'arte , napoli , 1925 il nuovo idealismo inglese e americano , napoli , 1927 la filosofia di e . meyerson e la logica dell'identità , napoli-città di castello , 1929 guglielmo di ockham , lanciano , 1931 la nozione del tempo secondo aristotele , lanciano , 1933 la fisica nuova . fondamenti di una nuova teoria della scienza , napoli , 1934 il principio della metafisica , napoli , 1936 la struttura dell'esistenza , torino , 1939 bernardino telesio e la filosofia del rinascimento , milano , 1941 introduzione all'esistenzialismo , milano , 1942 filosofia religione scienza , torino , 1947 l'esistenzialismo positivo , torino , 1948 possibilità e libertà , torino , 1956 storia della filosofia , torino , 1966 per o contro l'uomo , milano , 1968 fra il tutto e il nulla , milano , 1973 questa pazza filosofia ovvero l'io prigioniero , milano , 1979 la saggezza della filosofia . i problemi della nostra vita , milano , 1987 dizionario di filosofia , torino , 1987 ricordi di un filosofo , milano , 1990 scritti neoilluministici , torino , 2001 . references . external links . article on nicola abbagnano in the international dictionary of intellectual historians nicola abbagnano 's webpage www.abbagnanofilosofo.it
