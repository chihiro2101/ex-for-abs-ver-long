Iwate Prefecture

name . there are several theories about the origin of the name '' iwate '' , but the most well known is the tale oni no tegata , which is associated with the mitsuishi or '' three rocks '' shrine in morioka . these rocks are said to have been thrown down into morioka by an eruption of mt . iwate . according to the legend , there was once a devil who often tormented and harassed the local people . when the people prayed to the spirits of mitsuishi for protection , the devil was immediately shackled to these rocks and forced to make a promise never to trouble the people again . as a seal of his oath , the devil made a handprint on one of the rocks , thus giving rise to the name iwate , its direct translation being '' rock hand '' . even now after a rainfall , it is said that the devil 's hand print can still be seen there . culture . there are many present-day cultural foods popularly eaten in iwate prefecture , some of which include walnuts , wanko soba ( meaning '' bowl noodles '' ) and hittsumi-jiru ( meaning '' pull and tear '' , in reference to the way the dough is pulled and torn into oval shapes before being turned into noodles ) . iwate 's prefectural capital morioka is also popular for its apples , blooming in may and ready for harvest from september to november . japanese poet matsuo bashō visited iwate and wrote about it in the journey described in his major work oku no hosomichi . he was especially inspired by the town of hiraizumi . history . while the entire island of honshū was claimed by the japanese , or yamato , government from earliest times as a sort of divine right or manifest destiny , the imperial forces were unable to occupy any part of what would become iwate until 802 when two powerful emishi leaders , aterui and more , surrendered at fort isawa . the area now known as iwate prefecture was inhabited by the jōmon people who left their artifacts throughout the prefecture . for example , a large number of burial pits from the middle jōmon period ( 2,800–1,900 bc ) have been found in nishida . various sites from the late jōmon period ( 1,900–1,300 bc ) including tateishi , makumae and hatten contain clay figurines , masks and ear and nose shaped clay artifacts . the kunenbashi site in kitakami city has yielded stone '' swords '' , tablets and tools as well as clay figurines , earrings and potsherds from the final jōmon period ( 1,300–300 bc ) . the earliest mention of a japanese presence dates to about 630 when the hakusan shrine was said to have been built on mt . kanzan in what is now hiraizumi . at this time various japanese traders , hunters , adventurers , priests and criminals made their way to iwate . in 712 the province of mutsu , containing all of tōhoku , was divided into dewa province , the area west of the ōu mountains and mutsu province . in 729 kokuseki-ji temple was founded in what is now mizusawa ward , oshu city by the itinerant priest gyōki . little is known about relations between these japanese frontiersmen and the native emishi but in 776 they took a turn for the worse when large forces of the yamato army invaded iwate attacking the isawa and shiwa tribes in february and november of that year . more fighting occurred the next and following years but mostly in dewa and the area south of present-day iwate prefecture . this situation continued until march 787 when the yamato army suffered a disastrous defeat in the battle of sufuse village in what is now mizusawa ward , oshu city . there the emishi leaders and aterui leading a large cavalry force trapped the yamato infantry and pushed them into the kitakami river where their heavy armour proved deadly . over 1,000 soldiers drowned that day . the japanese general ki no asami kosami was '' rebuked '' by the emperor kanmu when he returned to kyoto . since the japanese could not win on the battlefield they resorted to other means to conquer the emishi . trade for superior quality iron wares and sake made the emishi dependent on the japanese for these valuable goods . bribes were offered to the emishi leaders in the form of japanese citizenship and rank if they would defect . finally a campaign of burning crops and kidnapping the emishi women and children and relocating them to western japan was adopted . many a stout warrior gave up the fight to join his family again . in 801 , sakanoue no tamuramaro began a new campaign against the isawa emishi having moderate success . finally on 15 april 802 the emishi leaders more and aterui surrendered with some 500 warriors . the captives were taken to kyoto for an audience with the emperor and beheaded at moriyama in kawachi province against the wishes of general sakanoue . this act of cruelty enraged the emishi leading to another twenty or more years of fighting . after the surrender numerous forts were built on the chinese model along the kitakami river . in 802 , fort isawa was built in what is now mizusawa ward , oshu city , in 803 , fort shiwa was built in what is now morioka city , and in 812 fort tokutan was built also in morioka . in the latter part of the heian period , the town of hiraizumi in what is now southern iwate became the capital of the northern fujiwara . the warrior minamoto no yoshitsune fled here after the genpei war . until the meiji restoration , the area of iwate prefecture was part of mutsu province . frédéric , '' provinces and prefectures '' in , p . 780 . iwate prefecture was created in 1876 , in the aftermath of the boshin war , which heralded the beginning of the meiji restoration . geography . iwate faces the pacific ocean to the east with sheer , rocky cliffs along most of the shoreline interrupted by a few sandy beaches . the border with akita prefecture on the west is generally formed by the highest points of the ōu mountains . aomori prefecture is to the north and miyagi prefecture is to the south . the ōu mountains on the west still contain active volcanoes such as mt . iwate ( at the highest point in the prefecture ) and mt . kurikoma . but the kitakami mountains running through the middle of the prefecture from north to south are much older and have not been active for thousands of years . mt . hayachine lies at the heart of the kitakami range . besides these two mountain ranges and the rugged coastline , the prefecture is characterized by the kitakami river which flows from north to south between the ōu and kitakami mountain ranges . it is the fourth longest river in japan and the longest in tōhoku . the basin of the kitakami is large and fertile providing room for the prefecture 's largest cities , industrial parks and farms . in the past iwate has been famous for its mineral wealth especially in the form of gold , iron , coal and sulfur but these are no longer produced . there is still an abundance of hot water for onsen , or hot springs , which is the basis of a thriving industry . the forests of the prefecture are another valuable resource . before world war ii the forests were mainly composed of beech but since then there has been a huge swing towards the production of faster growing japanese cedar . recently , though , there has been a push to restore the original beech forests in some areas . as of 31 march 2019 , 5 % of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as natural parks , namely towada-hachimantai and sanriku fukkō national parks ; kurikoma and hayachine quasi-national parks ; and goyōzan , hanamaki onsenkyō , kuji-hiraniwa , murone kōgen , oritsume basenkyō , sotoyama-hayasaka heights , and yuda onsenkyō
