Iranian Georgians

history . safavid era . most likely , the first extant community of georgians within iran was formed following shah tahmasp i 's invasions of georgia and the rest of the caucasus , in which he deported some 30,000 georgians and other caucasians back to mainland safavid iran . hamilton alexander rosskeen gibb , bernard lewis , johannes hendrik kramers , charles pellat , joseph schacht . the encyclopaedia of islam , parts 163-178 ( volume 10 ) . original from the university of michigan . p 109 the first genuine compact georgian settlements however appeared in iran in the 1610s when shah abbas i relocated some two hundred thousand from their historical homeland , eastern georgian provinces of kakheti and kartli , following a punitive campaign he conducted against his formerly most loyal georgian servants , namely teimuraz i of kakheti and luarsab ii of kartli . most of modern-day iranian georgians are the latters ' descendants , although the first large movements of georgians from the caucasus to the heartland of the safavid empire in iran happened as early as during the rule of tahmasp i . subsequent waves of large deportations after abbas also occurred throughout the rest of the 17th , but also the 18th and 19th centuries , the last ones by the qajar dynasty . a certain amount also migrated as muhajirs in the 19th century to iran , following the russian conquest of the caucasus . the georgian deportees were settled by the shah 's government into the scarcely populated lands which were quickly made by their new inhabitants into the lively agricultural areas . many of these new settlements were given georgian names , reflecting the toponyms found in georgia . during the safavid era , georgia became so politically and somewhat culturally intertwined with iran that georgians replaced the qizilbash among the safavid officials , alongside the circassians and armenians . during his travels the italian adventurer pietro della valle claimed that there was no household in persia without its georgian slaves , noticing the huge amounts of georgians present everywhere in society . the later safavid capital , isfahan , was home to many georgians . many of the city ’ s inhabitants were of georgian , circassian , and dagestan descent . isfahan-safavid period vii engelbert kaempfer , who was in safavid persia in 1684-85 , estimated their number at 20,000 . following an agreement between shah abbas i and his georgian subject teimuraz i of kakheti ( '' tahmuras khan '' ) , whereby the latter submitted to safavid rule in exchange for being allowed to rule as the region ’ s wāli ( governor ) and for having his son serve as dāruḡa ( '' prefect '' ) of isfahan in perpetuity , a georgian prince converted to islam served as governor . he was accompanied by a certain number of soldiers , and they spoke in georgian among themselves . there must also have been some georgian orthodox christians . the royal court in isfahan had a great number of georgian ḡolāms ( military slaves ) as well as georgian women . although they spoke persian or turkic , their mother tongue was georgian . during the last days of the safavid empire , the safavids arch enemy , namely the neighboring ottoman turks , as well as neighboring imperial russia , but also the tribal afghans from the far off easternmost regions of the empire took advantage of iranian internal weakness and invaded iran . the iranian georgian contribution in wars against the invading afghans was crucial . georgians fought in the battle of golnabad , and in the battle of fereydunshahr . in the latter battle they brought a humiliating defeat to the afghan army . in total , the persian sources mention that during the safavid era 225,000 georgians were transplanted to mainland iran during the first two centuries , while the georgian sources keep this number at 245,000 . babak rezvani . iranian georgians . afsharid era . during the afsharid dynasty , 5,000 georgian families were moved to mainland iran according to the persian sources , while the georgian sources keep it on 30,000 persons . . qajar era . during the qajar dynasty , the last iranian empire that would , despite very briefly , have effective control over georgia , 15,000 georgians were moved to iran according to the persian sources , while the georgian ones mention 22,000 persons . this last large wave of georgian movement and settlement towards mainland iran happened as a result of the battle of krtsanisi in 1795 . modern iran . despite their isolation from georgia , many georgians have preserved their language and some traditions , but embraced islam . the ethnographer lado aghniashvili was first from georgia to visit this community in 1890 . in the aftermath of world war i , the georgian minority in iran was caught in the pressures of the rising cold war . in 1945 , this compact ethnic community , along with other ethnic minorities that populated northern iran , came to the attention of the soviet as a possible instrument for fomenting unrest in iranian domestic politics . while the georgian ssr leadership wanted to repatriate them to georgia , moscow clearly preferred to keep them in iran . the soviet plans were abandoned only after joseph stalin realized that his plans to obtain influence in northern iran foiled by both iranian stubbornness and united states pressure . svetlana savranskaya and vladislav zubok ( editors ) , cold war international history project bulletin , i issue , 14/15 – conference reports , research notes and archival updates , p . 401

visited the iranian georgian community in fereydunshahr . thousands of local georgians gave the delegation a warm welcome , which included waving of the newly adopted georgian national flag with its

km to the west of isfahan in the area historically known as fereydan . in this area there are 10 georgian towns and villages around fereydunshahr . in this region the old georgian identity is retained the best compared to other places in iran , and most people speak and understand the georgian language there . there were other compact settlements in khorasan at abbas abad ( half-way between shahrud and sabzevar where there remained only one old woman who remembered georgian in 1934 ) , mazandaran at behshahr and farah abad , gilan , isfahan province at najafabad , badrud , rahmatabad , yazdanshahr and amir abad . these areas are frequently called gorji mahalleh ( '' georgian neighborhood '' ) . many georgians or iranians of partial georgian descent are also scattered in major iranian cities , such as tehran , isfahan , rasht , dezful , karaj and shiraz . most of these communities no longer speak the georgian language , but retain aspects of georgian culture and keep a georgian conscious . some argue that iranian georgians retain remnants of christian traditions , but there is no evidence for this . most georgians in fereydunshahr and fereydan speak and understand georgian . iranian georgians observe the shia traditions and also non-religious traditions similar to other people in iran . they observe the traditions of nowruz . the local self-designation of georgians in iran , like the rest of the georgians over the world is kartveli , from kartvelebi , georgian : ქართველები , namely georgians ) , although occasionally the ethnonyms gorj , gorji , or even gurj-i ( from persian '' gorji '' which means georgian ) . they call their language kartuli ( georgian : ქართული ) . as rezvani states , this is not surprising given that all other georgian dialects in iran are extinct . the number of georgians in iran is estimated to be over 100,000 . according to encyclopaedia georgiana ( 1986 ) some 12,000–14,000 lived in rural fereydan c . 1896 , encyclopaedia georgiana ( 1986 ) , vol . 10 , tbilisi : p . 263 . and a more recent estimation cited by rezvani ( published 2009 , written in 2008 ) states that there may be more than 61,000 georgians in fereydan . rezvani , babak . the fereydani georgian representation of identity and narration of history 2009 journal ;
