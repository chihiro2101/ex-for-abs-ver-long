Royal assent

united kingdom . before the royal assent by commission act 1541 allowed for delegation of the power to lords commissioners , assent was always required to be given by the sovereign in person before parliament . the last time it was given by the sovereign in person in parliament was during the reign of queen victoria at a prorogation on 12 august 1854 . there was a controversy over the meaning of this phrase : the verb elegerit is ambiguous , representing either the future perfect ( '' which the common people shall have chosen '' ) , or perfect subjunctive ( '' which the common people may have chosen '' ) . charles i , adopting the latter interpretation , considered himself committed only to uphold those laws and customs that already existed at the time of his coronation . the long parliament preferred the former translation , interpreting the oath as an undertaking to assent to any law passed by parliament , as the representative of the '' common people '' . the restoration convention parliament resolved the issue by removing the disputed phrase from the oath . after the english civil war , it was accepted that parliament should be summoned to meet regularly , but it was still commonplace for monarchs to refuse royal assent to bills . the sedition act 1661 even made it a treasonable offence to suggest that parliament had '' a legislative power without the king '' . in 1678 , charles ii withheld his assent from a bill '' for preserving the peace of the kingdom by raising the militia , and continuing them in duty for two and forty days , '' '' house of lords journal volume 13 : 27 november 1678 '' . journal of the house of lords : volume 13 : 1675–1681 ( 1771 ) , pp . 380–85 . retrieved 12 april 2007 . suggesting that he , not parliament , should control the militia .

e.g . , letter from duke of portland ( secretary of state ) to duke of atholl ( governor ) , 15 july 1796 , advising of the king 's approval to two acts but withholding assent to a third : op . cit p.352 but , during the british regency , the practice began of granting the equivalent of the royal assent to manx legislation by orders in council , e.g . , order in council of 7 march 1814 approving two acts : op . cit . p.381 which continues to this day , though limited to exceptional cases since 1981 . that year an order in council delegated to the lieutenant governor the power to grant royal assent to bills passed by tynwald . the lieutenant governor must however refer any bill impacting on reserved powers ( defence , foreign relations , nationality law , the relationship between the island and the united kingdom and any matters relating to the monarch ) to the british government for advice , on which he is required to act . since 1993 , the sodor and man diocesan synod of the church of england within the province of york has had power to enact measures making provision '' with respect to any matter concerning the church of england in the island '' . if approved by the tynwald , a measure '' shall have the force and effect of an act of tynwald upon the royal assent thereto being announced to the tynwald '' . between 1979 and 1993 , the synod had similar powers , but limited to the extension to the isle of man of measures of the general synod . church ( application of general synod measures ) act 1979 before 1994 , the equivalent of the royal assent was granted by order in council , as for a bill , but the power to grant the equivalent of the royal assent to measures has now been delegated to the lieutenant governor . sodor and man diocesan synod measures order 1994 a measure does not require promulgation . . other commonwealth realms . in commonwealth realms other than the uk , royal assent is granted or withheld either by the realm 's sovereign or , more frequently , by the representative of the sovereign , the governor-general . in federated realms , assent in each state or province is granted or withheld by the representatives of the sovereign . in australia , this is the governors of the states . for canada , this is the lieutenant governors of the provinces . a lieutenant governor may defer assent to the governor general , and the governor general may defer assent to federal bills to the sovereign . if the governor general of canada is unable to give assent , it can be done by either the deputy of the governor general of canada—the chief justice of canada—or another justice of the supreme court of canada . it is not actually necessary for the governor general to sign a bill passed by a legislature , the signature being merely an attestation . in each case , the parliament must be apprised of the granting of assent before the bill is considered to have become law . two methods are available : the sovereign 's representatives may grant assent in the presence of both houses of parliament ; alternatively , each house may be notified separately , usually by the speaker of that house . however , though both houses must be notified on the same day , notice to the house of commons while it is not in session may be given by way of publishing a special issue of the journals of the house of commons , whereas the senate must be sitting and the governor general 's letter read aloud by the speaker . at both state and federal realms in australia , assent is used as the means of enforcing a referendum that is required . this is done by providing that it will not be lawful to even submit the law for viceregal assent unless and until it has been approved by the required percentage of the voting populace at a referendum . . development . while royal assent has not been withheld for a bill backed by the government in the united kingdom since 1708 , it has often been withheld in british colonies and former colonies by governors acting on royal instructions . in the united states declaration of independence , colonists complained that george iii '' has refused his assent to laws , the most wholesome and necessary for the public good and has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance , unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained ; and when so suspended , he has utterly neglected to attend to them .

'' for other public or private bills , the formula is simply '' la reyne le veult '' ( '' the queen wills it '' ) . for personal bills , the phrase is '' soit fait comme il est désiré '' ( '' let it be done as it is desired '' ) . the appropriate formula for withholding assent is the euphemistic '' la reyne s'avisera '' ( '' the queen will consider it '' ) . when the sovereign is male , le roy is substituted for la reyne . before the reign of henry viii , the sovereign always granted his or her assent in person . the sovereign , wearing the imperial state crown , would be seated on the throne in the lords chamber , surrounded by heralds and members of the royal court—a scene that nowadays is repeated only at the annual state opening of parliament . the commons , led by their speaker , would listen from the bar of the lords , just outside the chamber . the clerk of the parliaments presented the bills awaiting assent to the monarch , save that supply bills were traditionally brought up by the speaker . the clerk of the crown , standing on the sovereign 's right , then read aloud the titles of the bills ( in earlier times , the entire text of the bills ) . the clerk of the parliaments , standing on the sovereign 's left , responded by stating the appropriate norman french formula . a new device for granting assent was created during the reign of king henry viii . in 1542 , henry sought to execute his fifth wife , catherine howard , whom he accused of committing adultery ; the execution was to be authorised not after a trial but by a bill of attainder , to which he would have to personally assent after listening to the entire text . henry decided that '' the repetition of so grievous a story and the recital of so infamous a crime '' in his presence '' might reopen a wound already closing in the royal bosom '' . quennell , peter ( 1951 ) .
