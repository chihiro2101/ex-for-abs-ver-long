presented a monologue james burke on the end of scarcity , first broadcast on bbc radio 4 on 26 december 2017 , in which he predicted nanotech-manufacturing would revolutionize the world economy and society . he has been writing his current book , culture of scarcity , since 2017 . in a may 2020 interview , burke said that he was writing a new connections book , which would be the basis for a new television series titled connections 21 , slated to air in january 2022 . . knowledge web . burke is the leading figure in the development of the knowledge web , the planned digital realization of his books and television programmes , which would allow the user to travel through history and create his or her own connections . eventually , the project may feature immersive virtual-reality historical

widespread use of computers for business decisions , the creation of metadata banks of personal information , and changes in human behaviour , such as greater willingness to reveal personal information to strangers . in an interview on the pm programme on bbc radio 4 on 30 august 2013 , burke discussed his predictions of a post-scarcity economy driven by advances in nanofactories , which he believes may be viable by the year 2043 . burke posed at least one of his predictions as a question . in connections , he notes that the increase in connections over time causes the rate of innovation to accelerate , and asks what happens when this rate , or more importantly 'change ' itself , becomes too much for the average person to handle . he also questions what this would mean for individual power , liberty , and privacy . in the conclusion of connections , burke said that computing and communications might be controlled by a computer science élite . later , he suggested at the conclusion of the day the universe changed that a worldwide revolution in communications and computer technology would allow people to instantaneously exchange ideas and opinions . television credits
