1727 ) . the scheme of allegorical wall and ceiling decorations of the hall depicts the protestant succession of english monarchs from william iii and mary ii to george i . on 28 june 1715 thornhill was awarded the commission to decorate the dome of st paul 's cathedral by '' a whig , low-church dominated committee inspired by a moral anglican nationalism '' . the archbishop of canterbury , thomas tenison , is said to have remarked : '' i am no judge of painting , but on two articles i think i may insist : first that the painter employed be a protestant ; and secondly that he be an englishman '' . the weekly packet said that the decision to award thornhill the commission would '' put to silence all the loud applauses hitherto given to foreign artists '' . the eight scenes in the dome ( 1716–19 ) , executed in grisaille , show episodes from the life of st . paul . thornhill 's vast murals in great houses often related to topical events , as seen through the eyes of his mainly whig patrons . at chatsworth , during 1707-8 thornhill painted a number of walls and ceilings , the most notable being the continuous wall and ceiling painting of the sabine room , then a lobby , but since used as a bedroom . here he painted the rape of the sabine women , a vast panorama of mounted warriors carrying off the sabine women to rome . he chooses to feature strongly hersilia , who was deified for her loyalty to her roman husband , romulus , as against her sabine family - a deliberate reference to mary , lauded by the whigs for supporting her protestant husband , william , against her catholic father , james . at hanbury hall , beneath an imposing view of both the olympian gods and the story of achilles which dominates the ceiling of the main staircase , thornhill added a small portrait of rev henry sacheverell , a tory propagandist put on trial for sedition by the whig government in 1710 , being cast to the furies to be burnt . in 1716 thornhill painted the ceiling of the great hall in blenheim palace for john churchill , 1st duke of marlborough , newly returned to the country after being prosecuted by the tory ministry in the last years of queen anne . the subject is , inevitably , the duke 's 1704 victory at the battle of blenheim , during the war of the spanish succession . his last major commission was to paint the chapel at wimpole hall ;
