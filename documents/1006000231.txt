George Gurdjieff

final years . after the war , gurdjieff tried to reconnect with his former pupils . ouspensky was reluctant , but after his death ( october 1947 ) , his widow advised his remaining pupils to see gurdjieff in paris . j . g . bennett also visited from england , the first meeting for 25 years . ouspensky 's pupils in england had all thought that gurdjieff was dead . they discovered he was alive only after the death of ouspensky , who had not told them that gurdjieff was still living . they were overjoyed to hear so , and many of ouspensky 's pupils including rina hands , basil tilley and catherine murphy visited gurdjieff in paris . hands and murphy worked on the typing and retyping of the forthcoming book all and everything . gurdjieff suffered a second car accident in 1948 but again made an unexpected recovery . '' i was looking at a dying man . even this is not enough to express it . it was a dead man , a corpse , that came out of the car ; and yet it walked . i was shivering like someone who sees a ghost . '' with iron-like tenacity , he managed to gain his room , where he sat down and said : '' now all organs are destroyed . must make new '' . then , he turned to bennett , smiling : '' tonight you come dinner . i must make body work '' . as he spoke , a great spasm of pain shook his body and blood gushed from an ear . bennett thought : '' he has a cerebral haemorrhage . he will kill himself if he continues to force his body to move '' . but then he reflected : '' he has to do all this . if he allows his body to stop moving , he will die . he has power over his body '' . perry , whitall : gurdjieff in the light of tradition , quoting j . g . bennett . after recovering , gurdjieff finalised plans for the official publication of beelzebub 's tales and made two trips to new york . he also visited the famous prehistoric cave paintings at lascaux , giving his interpretation of their significance to his pupils . gurdjieff died at the american hospital in neuilly-sur-seine , france . his funeral took place at the alexander nevsky cathedral , paris at 12 rue daru , paris . he is buried in the cemetery at avon ( near fontainebleau ) . james moore ( 1993 ) . gurdjieff & nbsp ; – a biography : the anatomy of a myth . . children . although no evidence or documents have certified anyone as a child of gurdjieff , the following seven people are believed to be his children : paul beekman taylor , shadows of heaven : gurdjieff and toomer ( red wheel , 1998 ) , p . 3 . cynthie sophia '' dushka '' howarth ( 1924–2010 ) ; her mother was dancer jessmin howarth . roger friedland and harold zellman , the fellowship : the untold story of frank lloyd wright and the taliesin fellowship ( harper collins , 2007 ) , page 424 jessmin howarth and dushka howarth , it 's up to ourselves : a mother , a daughter , and gurdjieff ( 1998 ) she went on to found the gurdjieff heritage foundation . sergei chaverdian ; his mother was lily galumnian chaverdian . paul beekman taylor , shadows of heaven : gurdjieff and toomer ( red wheel , 1998 ) , page xv andrei , born to a mother known only as georgii . eve taylor ( born 1928 ) ; the mother was one of his followers , american socialite edith annesley taylor . nikolai stjernvall ( 1919–2010 ) , whose mother was elizaveta grigorievna , wife of leonid robertovich de stjernvall . michel de salzmann ( 1923–2001 ) , whose mother was jeanne de salzmann ; he later became head of the gurdjieff foundation . paul beekman taylor , gurdjieff 's america : mediating the miraculous ( lighthouse editions , 2005 ) , page 211 svetlana hinzenberg ( 1917–1946 ) , daughter of olga ( olgivanna ) ivanovna hinzenberg and a future stepdaughter of architect frank lloyd wright . that svetlana is considered to be a daughter of gurdjieff by all his other identified children is cited in paul beekman taylor , shadows of heaven : gurdjieff and toomer ( red wheel , 1998 ) , page 3 friedland and zellman , the fellowship ( 2006 edition ) . p.18 , citing frank lloyd wright : an autobiography . '' in the winter of 1919 , humoring a friend , she ( olgivanna ) left her apartment to see a visiting armenian-born mystic , a man who was said to teach dances that could develop the will . she was , she recalled , 'looking for something beyond the limits of my senses . ' '' gurdjieff had a niece , luba gurdjieff everitt , who for about 40 years ( 1950s-1990s ) ran a small but rather famous restaurant , luba 's bistro , in knightsbridge , london . . ideas . gurdjieff believed that people can not perceive reality in their current condition because they do not possess a unified consciousness but rather live in a state of a hypnotic '' waking sleep '' . '' man lives his life in sleep , and in sleep he dies . '' p . d . ouspensky ( 1949 ) , in search of the miraculous as a result of this each person perceives things from a completely subjective perspective . he asserted that people in their typical state function as unconscious automatons , but that a person can '' wake up '' and become a different sort of human being altogether . jacob needleman , g . i . gurdjieff and his school some contemporary researchers claim gurdjieff 's concept of 'self-remembering is close to the buddhist concept of awareness or a popular definition of “ mindfulness . ” the buddhist term translated into english as “ mindfulness ” originates in the pali term “ sati , ” which is identical to sanskrit “ smṛti . ” both terms mean “ to remember . ” sergei kukharenko , '' hindu and buddhist views proliferation influence on gurdjieff 's teaching '' . self-development teachings . gurdjieff argued that many of the existing forms of religious and spiritual tradition on earth had lost connection with their original meaning and vitality and so could no longer serve humanity in the way that had been intended at their inception . as a result , humans were failing to realize the truths of ancient teachings and were instead becoming more and more like automatons , susceptible to control from outside and increasingly capable of otherwise unthinkable acts of mass hysteria such as world war i . at best , the various surviving sects and schools could provide only a one-sided development , which did not result in a fully integrated human being . according to gurdjieff , only one dimension of the three dimensions of the person—namely , either the emotions , or the physical body or the mind—tends to develop in such schools and sects , and generally at the expense of the other faculties or centers , as gurdjieff called them . as a result , these paths fail to produce a properly balanced human being . furthermore , anyone wishing to undertake any of the traditional paths to spiritual knowledge ( which gurdjieff reduced to three—namely the path of the fakir , the path of the monk , and the path of the yogi ) were required to renounce life in the world . gurdjieff thus developed a '' fourth way '' p . d . ouspensky ( 1949 ) , in search of the miraculous , chapter 2 which would be amenable to the requirements of modern people living modern lives in europe and america . instead of developing body , mind , or emotions separately , gurdjieff 's discipline worked on all three to promote comprehensive and balanced inner development . in parallel with other spiritual traditions , gurdjieff taught that a person must expend considerable effort to effect the transformation that leads to awakening . the effort that is put into practice gurdjieff referred to as '' the work '' or '' work on oneself '' . according to gurdjieff , '' . working on oneself is not so difficult as wishing to work , taking the decision . '' though gurdjieff never put major significance on the term '' fourth way '' and never used the term in his writings , his pupil p . d . ouspensky from 1924 to 1947 made the term and its use central to his own teaching of gurdjieff 's ideas . after ouspensky 's death , his students published a book titled the fourth way based on his lectures . gurdjieff 's teaching addressed the question of humanity 's place in the universe and the importance of developing latent potentialities—regarded as our natural endowment as human beings but rarely brought to fruition . he taught that higher levels of consciousness , higher bodies , p . d . ouspensky ( 1949 ) . in search of the miraculous chapter 2 inner growth and development are real possibilities that nonetheless require conscious work to achieve . p . d . ouspensky ( 1971 ) . the fourth way , chapter 1 in his teaching gurdjieff gave a distinct meaning to various ancient texts such as the bible and many religious prayers . he believed that such texts possess meanings very different from those commonly attributed to them . '' sleep not '' ; '' awake , for you know not the hour '' ; and '' the kingdom of heaven is within '' are examples of biblical statements which point to teachings whose essence has been forgotten . gurdjieff taught people how to increase and focus their attention and energy in various ways and to minimize daydreaming and absentmindedness . according to his teaching , this inner development of oneself is the beginning of a possible further process of change , the aim of which is to transform people into what gurdjieff believed they ought to be . p . d . ouspensky ( 1949 ) . in search of the miraculous , chapter 9 distrusting '' morality '' , which he describes as varying from culture to culture , often contradictory and hypocritical , gurdjieff greatly stressed the importance of '' conscience '' . to provide conditions in which inner attention could be exercised more intensively , gurdjieff also taught his pupils '' sacred dances '' or '' movements '' , later known as the gurdjieff movements , which they performed together as a group . he also left a body of music , inspired by what he heard in visits to remote monasteries and other places , written for piano in collaboration with one of his pupils , thomas de hartmann . gurdjieff also used various exercises , such as the '' stop '' exercise , to prompt self-observation in his students . other shocks to help awaken his pupils from constant daydreaming were always possible at any moment . methods . '' the work '' is in essence a training in the development of consciousness . gurdjieff used a number of methods and materials , including meetings , music , movements ( sacred dance ) , writings , lectures , and innovative forms of group and individual work . part of the function of these various methods was to undermine and undo the ingrained habit patterns of the mind and bring about moments of insight . since each individual has different requirements , gurdjieff did not have a one-size-fits-all approach , and he adapted and innovated as circumstance required . '' gurdjieff 's teachings were transmitted through special conditions and through special forms leading to consciousness : group work , physical labor , crafts , ideas exchanges , arts , music , movement , dance , adventures in nature . enabled the unrealized individual to transcend the mechanical , acted-upon self and ascend from mere personality to self-actualizing essence . '' seekerbooks.com , book review of gary lachman . in search of the miraculous : genius in the shadow of gurdjieff . in russia he was described as keeping his teaching confined to a small circle , p . d . ouspensky ( 1949 ) . in search of the miraculousm chapter 1 , whereas in paris and north america he gave numerous public demonstrations . g.i . gurdjieff ( 1963 ) meetings with remarkable men , chapter 11 gurdjieff felt that the traditional methods of self-knowledge—those of the fakir , monk , and yogi ( acquired , respectively , through pain , devotion , and study ) —were inadequate on their own and often led to various forms of stagnation and one-sidedness . his methods were designed to augment the traditional paths with the purpose of hastening the developmental process . he sometimes called these methods the way of the sly man see in search of the miraculous because they constituted a sort of short-cut through a process of development that might otherwise carry on for years without substantive results . the teacher , more adept , sees the individual requirements of the disciple and sets tasks that he knows will result in a transformation of consciousness in that individual . instructive historical parallels can be found in the annals of zen buddhism , where teachers employed a variety of methods ( sometimes highly unorthodox ) to bring about the arising of satori in the student . music . gurdjieff 's music divides into three distinct periods . the '' first period '' is the early music , including music from the ballet struggle of the magicians and music for early movements dating to the years around 1918 . the '' second period '' music , for which gurdjieff arguably became best known , written in collaboration with russian composer thomas de hartmann , is described as the gurdjieff-de hartmann music . dating to the mid-1920s , it offers a rich repertoire with roots in caucasian and central asian folk and religious music , russian orthodox liturgical music , and other sources . this music was often first heard in the salon at the prieuré , where much was composed . since the publication of four volumes of this piano repertoire by schott , recently completed , there has been a wealth of new recordings , including orchestral versions of music prepared by gurdjieff and de hartmann for the movements demonstrations of 1923–24 . solo piano versions of these works have been recorded by cecil lytle , keith jarrett , frederic chiu . the '' last musical period '' is the improvised harmonium music which often followed the dinners gurdjieff held at his paris apartment during the occupation and immediate post-war years to his death in 1949 . in all , gurdjieff in collaboration with de hartmann composed some 200 pieces . gurdjieff.org in may 2010 , 38 minutes of unreleased solo piano music on acetate was purchased by neil kempfer stocker from the estate of his late step-daughter , dushka howarth . in 2009 , pianist elan sicroff

composed by de hartmann in his teens ) . sicroff discography at allmusic in 1998 alessandra celletti released '' hidden sources '' ( kha records ) with 18 tracks by gurdjieff/de hartmann . movements . movements , or sacred dances , constitute an integral part of the gurdjieff work . gurdjieff sometimes referred to himself as a '' teacher of dancing '' and gained initial public notice for his attempts to put on a ballet in moscow called struggle of the magicians . films of movements demonstrations are occasionally shown for private viewing by the gurdjieff foundations , and one is shown in a scene in the peter brook movie meetings with remarkable men . writings . gurdjieff wrote a unique trilogy with the series title all and everything . the first volume , finalized by gurdjieff shortly before his death and first published in 1950 , is the first series and titled an objectively impartial criticism of the life of man or beelzebub 's tales to his grandson . at 1238 pages it is a lengthy allegorical work that recounts the explanations of beelzebub to his grandson concerning the beings of the planet earth and laws which govern the universe . it provides a vast platform for gurdjieff 's deeply considered philosophy . a controversial redaction of beelzebub 's tales was published by some of gurdjieff 's followers as an alternative '' edition '' , in 1992 . see paul beekman taylor 's ' gurdjieff 's worlds of words ( 2014 ) for an informed account . on his page of friendly advice facing the first contents page of beelzebub 's tales gurdjieff lays out his own program of three obligatory initial readings of each of the three series in sequence and concludes , '' only then will you be able to count upon forming your own impartial judgement , proper to yourself alone , on my writings . and only then can my hope be actualized that according to your understanding you will obtain the specific benefit for your self which i anticipate . '' the posthumous second series , edited by jeanne de salzmann , is titled meetings with remarkable men ( 1963 ) and is written in a seemingly accessible manner as a memoir of his early years , but also contains some 'arabian nights ' embellishments and allegorical statements . his posthumous third series , ( life is real only then , when ' i am ' ) , written as if unfinished and also edited by jeanne de salzmann , contains an intimate account of gurdjieff 's inner struggles during his later years , as well as transcripts of some of his lectures . an enormous and growing amount has been written about gurdjieff 's ideas and methods , but his own challenging writings remain the primary sources . reception and influence . opinions on gurdjieff 's writings and activities are divided . sympathizers regard him as a charismatic master who brought new knowledge into western culture , a psychology and cosmology that enable insights beyond those provided by established science . at the other end of the spectrum , some critics assert he was a charlatan with a large ego and a constant need for self-glorification . michael waldberg ( 1990 ) . gurdjieff & nbsp ; – an approach to his

notable personal students include p . d . ouspensky , olga de hartmann , thomas de hartmann , jane heap , jeanne de salzmann , willem nyland , lord pentland ( henry john sinclair ) , john g . bennett , alfred richard orage , maurice nicoll , and rene daumal . gurdjieff gave new life and practical form to ancient teachings of both east and west . for example , the socratic and platonic emphasis on '' the examined life '' recurs in gurdjieff 's teaching as the practice of self-observation . his teachings about self-discipline and restraint reflect stoic teachings . the hindu and buddhist notion of attachment recurs in gurdjieff 's teaching as the concept of identification . his descriptions of the '' three being-foods '' matches that of ayurveda , and his statement that '' time is breath '' echoes jyotish , the vedic system of astrology . similarly , his cosmology can be '' read '' against ancient and esoteric sources , respectively neoplatonic and in such sources as robert fludd 's treatment of macrocosmic musical structures . an aspect of gurdjieff 's teachings which has come into prominence in recent decades is the enneagram geometric figure . for many students of the gurdjieff tradition , the enneagram remains a kōan , challenging and never fully explained . there have been many attempts to trace the origins of this version of the enneagram ; some similarities to other figures have been found , but it seems that gurdjieff was the first person to make the enneagram figure publicly known and that only he knew its true source . others have used the enneagram figure in connection with personality analysis , principally with the enneagram of personality as developed by oscar ichazo , claudio naranjo and others . most aspects of this application are not directly connected to gurdjieff 's teaching or to his explanations of the enneagram . gurdjieff inspired the formation of many groups after his death , all of which still function today and follow his ideas . seymour b . ginsburg gurdjieff unveiled , pp . 71–7 , lighthouse editions ltd . , 2005 the gurdjieff foundation , the largest establishment organization influenced by the ideas of gurdjieff , was organized by jeanne de salzmann during the early 1950s , and led by her in cooperation with other pupils of his . other pupils of gurdjieff formed independent groups . willem nyland , one of gurdjieff 's closest students and an original founder and trustee of the gurdjieff foundation of new york , left to form his own groups in the early 1960s . jane heap was sent to london by gurdjieff , where she led groups until her death in 1964 . louise goepfert march , who became a pupil of gurdjieff 's in 1929 , started her own groups in 1957 and founded the rochester folk art guild in the finger lakes region of new york state . independent thriving groups were also formed and initially led by john g . bennett and a . l . staveley near portland , oregon . pupils . gurdjieff 's notable pupils include : gurdjieff : an annotated bibliography , j . walter driscoll and the gurdjieff foundation of california , garland , 1985 . peter d . ouspensky ( 1878–1947 ) was a russian journalist , author and philosopher . he met gurdjieff in 1915 and spent the next five years studying with him , then formed his own independent groups at london in 1921 . ouspensky became the first '' career '' gurdjieffian and led independent fourth way groups in london and new york for his remaining years . he wrote in search of the miraculous about his encounters with gurdjieff and it remains the best known and most widely read account of gurdjieff 's early experiments with groups . thomas de hartmann ( 1885–1956 ) was a russian composer . he and his wife olga first met gurdjieff in 1916 at saint petersburg . they remained gurdjieff 's close students until 1929 . during that time they lived at gurdjieff 's institute for the harmonious development of man near paris . between july 1925 and may 1927 thomas de hartmann transcribed and co-wrote some of the music that gurdjieff collected and used for his movements exercises . they collaborated on hundreds of pieces of concert music arranged for the piano . this concert music was first recorded and published privately from the 1950s to 1980s ; then first issued publicly as the music of gurdjieff / de hartmann , thomas de hartmann , piano by triangle records , with 49 tracks on 4 vinyl disks in 1998 , then reissued as a 3-cd set in containing 56 tracks in 1989 . a more extensive compilation was later issued as the gurdjieff / de hartmann music for the piano in 4 printed volumes by schott between 1996 and 2005 , and as audio cds under the same title in four volumes with nine discs recorded with three concert pianists , by schott/wergo between 1997 and 2001 . olga de hartmann ( née arkadievna , 1885–1987 ) was gurdjieff 's personal secretary during their prieuré years and took most of the original dictations of his writings during that period . she also authenticated gurdjieff 's early talks in the book views from the real world ( 1973 ) . the de hartmanns ' memoir , our life with mr gurdjieff ( 1st ed , 1964 , 2nd ed , 1983 , 3rd ed 1992 ) , records their gurdjieff years in great detail . their montreal gurdjieff group , literary and musical estate is represented by retired canadian national film board producer tom daly . jeanne de salzmann ( 1889–1990 ) . alexander and jeanne de salzmann met gurdjieff in tiflis in 1919 . she was originally a dancer , a dalcroze eurythmics teacher . she was , along with jessmin howarth and rose mary nott , responsible for transmitting gurdjieff 's choreographed movement exercises and institutionalizing gurdjieff 's teachings through the gurdjieff foundation of new york , the gurdjieff institute of paris , london 's gurdjieff society inc . , and other groups she established in 1953 . she also established triangle editions in the us , which imprint claims copyright on all gurdjieff 's posthumous writings . john g . bennett ( 1897–1974 ) was a british intelligence officer , polyglot ( fluent in english , french , german , turkish , greek , italian ) , technologist , industrial research director , author , and teacher , best known for his many books on psychology and spirituality , particularly the teachings of gurdjieff . bennett met both ouspensky and then gurdjieff at istanbul in 1920 , spent august 1923 at gurdjieff 's institute , became ouspensky 's pupil between 1922 and 1941 and , after learning that gurdjieff was still alive , was one of gurdjieff 's frequent visitors in paris during 1949 . see witness : the autobiography of john bennett ( 1974 ) , gurdjieff : making a new world ( 1974 ) , idiots in paris : diaries of j . g . bennett and elizabeth bennett , 1949 ( 1991 ) . alfred richard orage ( 1873–1934 ) was an influential british editor best known for the magazine new age . he began attending ouspensky 's london talks in 1921 then met gurdjieff when the latter first visited london early in 1922 . shortly thereafter , orage sold new age and relocated to gurdjieff 's institute at the prieré , and in 1924 was appointed by gurdjieff to lead the institute 's branch in new york . after gurdjieff 's nearly fatal automobile accident in july 1924 and because of his prolonged recuperation during 1924 and intense writing period for several years , orage continued in new york until 1931 . during this period , orage was responsible for editing the english typescript of beelzebub 's tales ( 1931 ) and meetings with remarkable men ( 1963 ) as gurdjieff 's assistant . this period is described in some detail by paul beekman taylor in his gurdjieff and orage : brothers in elysium ( 2001 ) . maurice nicoll ( 1884–1953 ) was a harley street psychiatrist and carl jung 's delegate in london . along with orage he attended ouspensky 's 1921 london talks where he met gurdjieff . with his wife catherine and their daughter , he spent almost a year at gurdjieff 's prieuré institute . a year later , when they returned to london , nicoll rejoined ouspensky 's group . in 1931 , on ouspensky 's advice he started his own fourth way groups in england . he is best known for the encyclopedic six-volume series of articles in psychological commentaries on the teaching of gurdjieff and ouspensky ( boston : shambhala , 1996 , and samuel weiser inc . , 1996 ) . willem nyland ( 1890–1975 ) was a dutch-american chemist who first met gurdjieff early in 1924 during the latter 's first visit to the us . he was a charter member of the ny branch of gurdjieff 's institute , participated in orage 's meetings between 1924 and 1931 , and was a charter member of the gurdjieff foundation from 1953 and through its formative years . in the early 1960s he established an independent group in warwick ny , where he began making reel-to-reel audio recordings of his meetings , which became archived in a private library of some 2600 90-minute audio tapes . many of these tapes have also been transcribed and indexed , but remain unpublished . gurdjieff group work with wilhem ( sic-willem ) nyland ( 1983 ) by irmis b . popoff , sketches nyland 's group work . jane heap ( 1883–1964 ) was an american writer , editor , artist , and publisher . she met gurdjieff during his 1924 visit to new york , and set up a gurdjieff study group at her apartment in greenwich village . in 1925 , she moved to paris to study at gurdjieff 's institute , and re-established her group in paris until 1935 when gurdjieff sent her to london to lead the group c . s . nott had established and which she continued to lead until her death . jane heap 's paris group became gurdjieff 's 'rope ' group after her departure , and contained several notable writers , including margaret anderson , solita solano , kathryn hulme , and others who proved helpful to gurdjieff while he was editing his first two books . kenneth macfarlane walker ( 1882–1966 ) was a prominent british surgeon and prolific author . he was a member of ouspensky 's london group for decades , and after the latter 's death in 1947 visited gurdjieff in paris many times . as well as many accessible medical books for lay readers , he wrote some of the earliest informed accounts of gurdjieff 's ideas , venture with ideas ( 1951 ) and a study of gurdjieff 's teaching ( 1957 ) . henry john sinclair , 2nd baron pentland ( 1907–1984 ) was a pupil of ouspensky 's during the 1930s and 1940s . he visited gurdjieff regularly in paris in 1949 , then was appointed as president of the gurdjieff foundation of america by jeanne de salzmann when she founded that institution at new york in 1953 . he established the gurdjieff foundation of california in the mid-1950s and remained president of the us foundation branches until his death . pentland also became president of triangle editions when it was established in 1974 . critics . louis pauwels , among others , criticizes gurdjieff for his insistence on considering people as '' asleep '' in a state closely resembling '' hypnotic sleep '' . gurdjieff said , even specifically at times , that a pious , good , and moral person was no more '' spiritually developed '' than any other person ; they are all equally '' asleep '' . henry miller approved of gurdjieff not considering himself holy but , after writing a brief introduction to fritz peters ' book boyhood with gurdjieff , miller wrote that people are not meant to lead a '' harmonious life '' as gurdjieff believed in naming his institute . critics note that gurdjieff gives no value to most of the elements that compose the life of an average person . according to gurdjieff , everything an average person possesses , accomplishes , does , and feels is completely accidental and without any initiative . a common everyday ordinary person is born a machine and dies a machine without any chance of being anything else . this belief seems to run counter to the judeo-christian tradition that man is a living soul . gurdjieff believed that the possession of a soul ( a state of psychological unity which he equated with being '' awake '' ) was a '' luxury '' that a disciple could attain only by the most painstaking work over a long period of time . the majority—in whom the true meaning of the gospel failed to take root see the parable of the sower —went the '' broad way '' that '' led to destruction . '' enter ye in at the strait gate : for wide is the gate , and broad is the way , that leadeth to destruction , and many there be which go in thereat : because strait is the gate , and narrow is the way , which leadeth unto life , and few there be that find it . matthew 7 , 13–14 . in beelzebub 's tales to his grandson ( see bibliography ) , gurdjieff expresses his reverence for the founders of the mainstream religions of east and west and his contempt ( by and large ) for what successive generations of believers have made of those religious teachings . his discussions of '' orthodoxhydooraki '' and '' heterodoxhydooraki '' —orthodox fools and heterodox fools , from the russian word durak ( fool ) —position him as a critic of religious distortion and , in turn , as a target for criticism from some within those traditions . gurdjieff has been interpreted by some , ouspensky among others , to have had a total disregard for the value of mainstream religion , philanthropic work and the value of doing right or wrong in general . gurdjieff 's former students who have criticized him argue that , despite his seeming total lack of pretension to any kind of '' guru holiness '' , in many anecdotes his behavior displays the unsavory and impure character of a man who was a cynical manipulator of his followers . cafes.net gurdjieff 's own pupils wrestled to understand him . for example , in a written exchange between luc dietrich and henri tracol dating to 1943 : '' l.d . : how do you know that gurdjieff wishes you well ? h.t . : i feel sometimes how little i interest him—and how strongly he takes an interest in me . by that i measure the strength of an intentional feeling .
