Brandenburg an der Havel

history . middle ages . left the castle of brandenburg , which had been a fortress of the slavic tribe stodoranie , was conquered in 929 by king henry the fowler . it was first mentioned as brendanburg in 948 . that the name of the city in the local slavic language was brennabor , a combination of two words brenna - defense and bor - fort , is an invention of the 17th century . the town remained german only until 983 , when a slavic rebellion was successful . during the next 170 years the area was ruled by slavic princes of the hevelli tribe . the last of them , pribislav , died in 1150 . from 1153/1154 to 1157 brendanburg was part of the slavonic duchy of kopanica , a fief of poland . afterwards albert i settled here and became the first margrave of brandenburg . the town was restricted to the western bank of the havel until 1196 , when it was extended to the eastern side . the parts on either side of the river were regarded as three towns ( old town , new town and brandenburg cathedral district ) for centuries . in 1314–1315 the old and new towns joined the hanseatic league . in the thirty years ' war ( 1618–1648 ) the towns suffered plundering and destruction which led to a loss of power ; potsdam became the new capital , and the court left the town of brandenburg . in 1715 old town and new town were merged to form a single town . in 1928 the brandenburg cathedral district was added . modern history . in the late 19th century brandenburg an der havel became a very important industrial center in the german empire . steel industries settled there , and several world-famous bicycle brands such as brennabor , corona and excelsior were manufactured in the city . a world-famous toy industry was also established . with a giant industrial complex , the deutsche reichsbahn ( german imperial railways ) was located in brandenburg-kirchmöser during the time between the two world wars and the time of the former gdr . the city 's excellent transport infrastructure was a big advantage . in 1933/34 , a concentration camp , one of the first in nazi germany , was located on neuendorfer straße in brandenburg old town . after closing this inner city concentration camp , the nazis used the brandenburg-görden prison , located in the suburb of görden . later the old gaol became the brandenburg euthanasia centre where the nazis killed people with mental diseases , including children . they called this operation '' action t4 '' because of the berlin address , tiergartenstraße 4 , the headquarters of this planned and well-organized forced euthanasia organisation . brandenburg an der havel was one of the first locations in the third reich where the nazis experimented with killing their victims by gas . here , they prepared the mass killings in auschwitz and other extermination camps . after complaints by local inhabitants about the smoke , the mobile furnaces used to burn the corpses ceased operation . shortly after this , the nazis closed the old prison . in 1934 , the arado aircraft company ( arado flugzeugwerke ) , which originated in warnemünde , built a satellite factory in brandenburg that began producing planes in 1935 . the factory was expanded over the next five years , and produced trainers and other aircraft for the luftwaffe during world war ii . the existence of this factory was one of the reasons brandenburg was heavily bombed in later stages of the war ; by 1945 , 70 % of the city was destroyed . friedrich fromm , a german officer involved in the july 20 plot to assassinate hitler , was executed here in march 1945 for his part in the plot , even though fromm betrayed those conspirators he knew and ordered their execution . on july 25 , 1952 , plaue and kirchmöser were incorporated in the city of brandenburg an der havel . gemeinden 1994 und ihre veränderungen seit 01.01.1948 in den neuen ländern , verlag metzler-poeschel , stuttgart 1995 , , hrsg . : statistisches bundesamt after german reunification the city 's population declined from around 100,000 in 1989 to roughly 75,000 in 2005 through emigration . the migration was mainly by young people . demography . file : bevölkerungsentwicklung stadt_brandenburg.pdf development of population since 1875 within the current boundaries ( blue line : population ;
