, the british version of an american game show . he went on to host more than 30 different quiz shows on british television . his public profile growing , monkhouse also began appearing in comedy films , including the first of the carry on film series , carry on sergeant , in 1958 . he starred in dentist in the chair ( 1960 ) and dentist on the job ( 1961 ) , later regretting not choosing the carry ons over the dental comedies . other presenting jobs in the 1960s included hosting candid camera and compèring sunday night at the london palladium . around 1969 he was a partner , with malcolm mitchell , in the mitchell monkhouse agency . in 1979 he starred in a us sketch comedy television series called bonkers ! with the hudson brothers and joan rivers , a job he hated . in the early 1970s he appeared on bbc radio in mostly monkhouse with josephine tewson and david jason . stand-up comedy . a respected stand-up comedian , monkhouse was known for his talent at ad-libbing . he became much in demand as an after-dinner speaker and wrote a book about the subject , just say a few words ( lennard publishing , 1988 , 1999 ) . he also became a favourite with impressionists , and , as his comedy style fell out of favour in the 1980s , he was mocked for his slickness and accused of insincerity . he came back into fashion during the 1990s , and an appearance on have i got news for you helped to restore his popularity . monkhouse 's final stand-up show was performed at the albany comedy club in london on 25 august 2003 , four months before his death . the show was broadcast by the bbc in 2016 and again in november 2019 and april 2020 . among the audience were a number of british comedians who had been personally invited by monkhouse , including reece shearsmith , jon culshaw , david walliams , fiona allen and mark steel . the show also included a rare public appearance from monkhouse 's friend mike yarwood . game shows . in his later years , monkhouse was probably better known for hosting television quiz shows than for being a comedian . one of his biggest successes was the golden shot from july 1967 until january 1972 and again from july 1974 to april 1975 . this was broadcast live for 52 weeks a year and drew up to 17 million viewers . his tenure ended with allegations , which he denied , that he had taken bribes to include branded goods on the programme as advertisements . he returned in 1974 after subsequent presenters and comedians norman vaughan and charlie williams were found wanting . the dozens of other shows monkhouse presented included celebrity squares , family fortunes and bob 's full house . audiences regularly topped 15 million . in the late 1980s he hosted two series of the revival of the talent show opportunity knocks , which aired as bob says opportunity knocks . he then moved to itv to front two more game shows , bob 's your uncle and the 64,000 question , neither of which were popular successes . between 1996 and 1998 , monkhouse presented the national lottery live show on saturday evenings on bbc one , for which he created the catchphrase : '' i know i 'm a sinner , but make me a winner ! '' the opening to each show would see him deliver several minutes of topical jokes and on one occasion , where his autocue failed , he improvised a new and topical routine . this talent was used in bob monkhouse on the spot , a return to pure television comedy in which audience members suggested topics and monkhouse came up with a routine . he was also at the helm when infamously , on 30 november 1996 , the lottery machine failed live on air , causing the draw to be delayed by 50 minutes until after that night 's episode of casualty aired . monkhouse then returned to quizzes , taking over hosting duties on wipeout from paul daniels when its studio recordings moved from london to manchester and the show moved from primetime to daytime . monkhouse hosted wipeout from 1998 until a few months before his death in 2003 . chat show . after being a stalwart of chat shows , in the mid 1980s monkhouse presented his own for the bbc , the bob monkhouse show . the show lasted two series and showcased comedians of every age . monkhouse was criticised for sycophancy towards his guests but said that they were all heroes of his and that was how he really felt about them . monkhouse was known as a keen supporter of new comedy and used the show to introduce audiences to new comedians such as kelly monteith , robin williams and jim carrey . the format of the interviews varied between '' true '' chat and analysis of comedy to scripted routines in which monkhouse would willingly play the role of the guest 's stooge , as he did with bob hope . on one occasion the guest was the comedian pamela stephenson , who , after prior arrangement with the show 's producer , appeared in a series of fake plaster casts , apparently the result of accidents whilst at home . during the interview she produced a handgun and fired it on several occasions , destroying a plant pot on the set and a series of lights in the studio roof . she then presented a rocket launcher which she promptly '' fired '' , destroying a camera . the gun , launcher and camera were props . none of this was known to monkhouse , who appeared genuinely frightened ( although the production crew were aware ) . film and television archive . an expert on the history of silent movies and a film collector , monkhouse presented mad movies in 1966 . he wrote , produced , financed and syndicated the show worldwide . the show featured clips from comic silent films , many from his own private collection , some of which he had helped to recover and restore . this film collection was the cause of a court case at the old bailey in 1979 . having lent terry wogan 's son a film , monkhouse was charged with attempting to defraud film distributors of royalties , but after two years the judge decided that there was no case to answer . many of the films in his collection were seized and not returned to monkhouse . in 2008 , the british film institute was contacted by monkhouse 's daughter , abigail , who asked if they would like to view the collection and provide some advice as to the best way of preserving it . amongst the discoveries were many radio and tv shows long thought lost . dick fiddy , the archivist , said : '' it 's a huge , unwieldy collection which deals with a number of areas . it 's not just film and tv . initially , we found half a dozen tv shows that we knew to be missing . '' amongst those shows rediscovered were many that feature monkhouse himself , including the flip side , a 1966 play in which he starred as a television dj with his own late night show , and the 1957-58 series of his comedy my pal bob , including an episode in which he is suspected of an extramarital affair . the archive consisted of 36,000 videotapes , going back to when monkhouse first bought a home video recorder in 1966 . his film archive began in the late 1950s . the entire monkhouse film and television archive is now held by kaleidoscope , including all the material previously held by the bfi national archive ( nftva ) . it was catalogued and restored to digital formats for a major event at british academy of film and television arts ( bafta ) on 24 october 2009 . chris perry , of kaleidoscope and kaleidoscope publishing , said : '' we are painstakingly transferring the important contents of the video tapes and restoring radio shows . there are many incredible finds , and the event is an exciting time for all concerned .
