Bunk Johnson

education and early musical career . johnson received lessons from adam olivier and began playing professionally in olivier 's orchestra . johnson probably played a few adolescent jobs with buddy bolden , but was not a regular member of bolden 's band ( contrary to johnson 's claim ) . johnson was regarded as one of the top trumpeters in new orleans in the years 1905–1915 , in between repeatedly leaving the city to tour with minstrel shows and circus bands . after he failed to appear for a new orleans mardi gras parade job in 1915 , he learned that krewe members intended to do him bodily harm . so he left town , touring with shows and then by the early 1920s settling in new iberia , louisiana . in 1931 he lost his trumpet and front teeth when a fight broke out at a dance in rayne , louisiana , putting an end to his playing . he thereafter worked in manual labor , occasionally giving music lessons . career revival and first recordings . in 1938 and 1939 the writers of an early book of jazz history , jazzmen , interviewed several prominent musicians of the time , including louis armstrong , sidney bechet , and clarence williams , who spoke highly of johnson in the old days in new orleans . the writers tracked down johnson 's address , and traded several letters with him , where he recalled ( and possibly embellished ) his early career . johnson stated that he could play again if he only had new teeth and a new trumpet . a collection was taken up by writers and musicians , and he was fitted with a set of dentures by bechet 's dentist brother , leonard , and given a new trumpet . he made his first recordings in 1942 , for jazz man records . later touring career . these first recordings propelled johnson ( along with clarinetist george lewis ) into public attention , attracting a cult following . johnson and his band played in new orleans , san francisco , boston , and new york city and made many more recordings . johnson 's work in the 1940s shows why he was well regarded by his fellow musicians—on his best days playing with great imagination , subtlety , and beauty—as well as suggesting why he had not achieved fame earlier , for he was unpredictable , temperamental , with a passive-aggressive streak and a fondness for drinking alcohol to the point of impairment . death and legacy . johnson suffered from a stroke in late 1948 and died in new iberia the following year . jazz fans and historians still debate johnson 's legacy , and the extent to which his colorful reminiscences of his early career were accurate , misremembered , exaggerated , or untrue . although in recent years , new evidence has appeared in jazz historian vic hobson 's 2014 creating jazz counterpoint . new orleans , barbershop harmony , and the blues , in which is stated that buddy bolden 's band member willy cornish - who is seen on the only surviving picture of the bolden band - affirmed bunk johnson as a member of the early jazz group . this puts johnson 's own statements and recordings , in which he actively recreated the bolden tunes , in a plausible and positive light , making them of great historical and musicological importance to the study of jazz and new orleans jazz in particular . the majority of his recordings remain in print on cd reissues , and his playing is an important influence on many contemporary traditional jazz musicians . johnson plays a small , but significant , role in alan schroeder 's picture book satchmo 's blues . in that book , johnson serves as a source of musical inspiration to the young louis armstrong . selected discography . 1942 . the following records were recorded june , 1942 , and released on jazz man records .
