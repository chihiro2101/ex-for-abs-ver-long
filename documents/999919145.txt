Duchy of Berg

history . ascent . the counts of berg emerged in 1101 as a junior line of the dynasty of the ezzonen , which traced its roots back to the 9th-century lotharingia , and in the 11th century became the most powerful dynasty in the region of the lower rhine . in 1160 , the territory split into two portions , one of them later becoming the mark ( county ) , which returned to the possession of the family line in the 16th century . the most powerful of the early rulers of berg , engelbert ii of berg died in an assassination on november 7 , 1225 . in 1280 the counts moved their court from schloss burg on the wupper river to the town of düsseldorf . count adolf viii of berg fought on the winning side in the battle of worringen against guelders in 1288 . the power of berg grew further in the 14th century . the duchy of jülich united with the county of berg in 1348 , and in 1380 the emperor wenceslaus elevated the counts of berg to the rank of dukes , thus originating the duchy of jülich-berg . problems of succession . in 1509 , john iii , duke of cleves , made a strategic marriage to maria von geldern , daughter of william iv , duke of jülich-berg , who became heiress to her father 's estates : jülich , berg and the county of ravensberg , which under the salic laws of the holy roman empire caused the properties to pass to the husband of the female heir ( women could not hold property except through a husband or a guardian ) . with the death of her father in 1521 the dukes of jülich-berg became extinct , and the estate thus came under the rule of john iii , duke of cleves — along with his personal territories , the mark ( county ) and the duchy of cleves ( kleve ) in a personal union . as a result of this union the dukes of the united duchies of jülich-cleves-berg controlled much of present-day north rhine-westphalia , with the exception of the clerical states of the archbishop of cologne and of the bishop of münster . however , the new ducal dynasty also became extinct in 1609 , when the last duke died insane . this led to a lengthy dispute over succession to the various territories before the partition of 1614 : the palatinate-neuburg , who had converted to catholicism , annexed jülich and berg ; while cleves and mark fell to john sigismund , elector of brandenburg , who subsequently also became duke of prussia . upon the extinction of the senior dynasty ruling the electorate of the palatinate in 1685 , the neuburg line inherited the electorate and generally made düsseldorf its capital until the elector palatine also inherited the electorate of bavaria in 1777 . french revolution , grand duchy of berg . the french occupation ( 1794–1801 ) and annexation ( 1801 ) of jülich ( french : juliers ) during the french revolutionary wars separated the two duchies of jülich and berg , and in 1803 berg separated from the other bavarian territories and came under the rule of a junior branch of the wittelsbachs . in 1806 , in the reorganization of the german lands occasioned by the end of the holy roman empire , berg became the grand duchy of berg , under the rule of napoleon 's brother-in-law , joachim murat . murat 's arms combined the red lion of berg with the arms of the duchy of cleves . the anchor and the batons came to the party due to murat 's positions as grand admiral and as marshal of the empire . as the husband of napoleon 's sister caroline bonaparte , murat also had the right to use the imperial eagle . in 1809 , one year after murat 's promotion from grand duke of berg to king of naples , napoleon 's young nephew , prince napoleon louis bonaparte ( 1804–1831 , elder son of napoleon 's brother louis bonaparte , king of holland ) became the grand duke of berg ; french bureaucrats administered the territory in the name of the child . the grand duchy 's short existence came to an end with napoleon 's defeat in 1813 and the peace settlements that followed . province of jülich-cleves-berg . in 1815 , after the congress of vienna , berg became part of a province of the kingdom of prussia : the province of jülich-cleves-berg . in 1822 this province united with the grand duchy of the lower rhine to form the rhine province . rulers of berg . image : grand duchy of berg ( 1812 ) . svg thumb 400px the grand duchy of berg in 1812 . house of ezzonen . hermann i '' pusillus '' , count palatine of lotharingia adolf i of lotharingia , vogt of deutz adolf ii of lotharingia , vogt of deutz . house of berge . 1077–1082 adolf i of berg , 1st count of berg 1082–1093 adolf ii of berg-hövel ( huvili ) , count of berg 1093–1132 adolf iii , count of berg 1132–1160 adolf iv , count of berg c.1140-1148 adolf v , count of berg 1160–1189 engelbert i , count of berg 1189–1218 adolf vi , count of berg 1218–1225 engelbert ii of berg , archbishop of cologne , regent of berg 1218–1248 irmgard , heiress of berg , marries in 1217 henry iv , duke of limburg . house of limburg . 1218–1247 henry iv duke of limburg , count of berg 1247–1259 adolf vii count of limburg , count of berg 1259–1296 adolf viii 1296–1308 william i 1308–1348 adolf ix . house of jülich ( -heimbach ) , counts . – in union with ravensberg – 1348–1360 gerhard 1360–1380 wilhelm ii ;
