H. E. Bates

early life . h.e . bates was born on 16 may 1905 in rushden , northamptonshire , and educated at kettering grammar school . after leaving school , he worked as a reporter and a warehouse clerk . many of his stories depict life in the rural midlands of england , particularly his native northamptonshire . bates was partial to taking long walks around the northamptonshire countryside and this often provided the inspiration for his stories . bates was a great lover of the countryside and this was exemplified in two volumes of essays entitled through the woods and down the river . both have been reprinted numerous times . career . he discarded his first novel , written when he was in his late teens , but his second , and the first one to be published , the two sisters , was inspired by one of his midnight walks , which took him to the small village of farndish . there , late at night , he saw a light burning in a cottage window and it was this that triggered the story . vannatta , dennis , 1983 , h.e . bates , boston , twayne publishers , at this time , he was working briefly for the local newspaper in wellingborough , a job which he hated , and then later at a local shoe-making warehouse , where he had time to write ; in fact the whole of this first novel was written there . this was sent to , and rejected by , eight or nine publishers baldwin , dean , 1987 , h.e . bates , selinsgrove , susquehanna university press , until jonathan cape accepted it on the advice of its highly respected reader , edward garnett . bates was then twenty years old . more novels , collections of short stories , essays , and articles followed , but did not pay well . world war ii short stories . during world war ii , he was commissioned into the raf solely to write short stories . the air ministry realised that it might move public sentiment by focusing more with stories about the people fighting the war , rather than a focus on facts and figures . the stories were originally published in the news chronicle under the pseudonym of “ flying officer x ” . later they were published in book form as the greatest people in the world and other stories and how sleep the brave and other stories . his first financial success was fair stood the wind for france . following a posting to the far east , this was followed by two novels about burma , the purple plain in 1947 and the jacaranda tree , and one set in india , the scarlet sword . he was also commissioned by the air ministry to write flying bombs , but because of various disagreements within the government , it was shelved , and then publication was banned for 30 years . it eventually was discovered by bob ogley and published in 1994 . another commission which has still to be published is night fighters . post-war work . other novels followed after the war ; he averaged roughly one novel and a collection of short stories a year , which was considered highly productive at the time . these included the feast of july and love for lydia . his most popular creation was the larkin family in the darling buds of may . pop larkin and his family were inspired by a colourful character seen in a local shop in kent by bates and his family when on holiday . the man ( probably wiltshire trader william dell , also on holiday ) turned up to the shop with a huge wad of rubber-banded bank notes and proceeded to spoil his trailer load of children with easter eggs and ice creams . other characters were modelled on friends and acquaintances of bates , such as iris snow ( a parody of iris murdoch ) and the brigadier who was modelled on the father of john bayley , murdoch 's husband . the television adaptation , produced after his death by his son richard and based on these stories , was a tremendous success . it is also the source of the american movie the mating game . the my uncle silas stories were also made into a uk tv series from 2000–2003 . many other stories were adapted to tv and others to films , the most renowned being the purple plain in 1954 and the triple echo ; bates worked on other film scripts . personal life . in 1931 , he married madge cox , his sweetheart from the next road in his native rushden . they moved to the village of little chart in kent and bought an old granary and this together with an acre of garden they converted into a home . bates was a keen and knowledgeable gardener who wrote many books on flowers . the granary remained their home for the whole of their married life . after bates ' death madge moved to a bungalow , which had originally been a cow byre , next to the granary . she died in 2004 at the age of 95 . they raised two sons and two daughters . their younger son jonathan was nominated for an academy award for his sound work on the 1982 film gandhi . . honours and death . bates died on 29 january 1974 in canterbury , kent , aged 68 . a prolific and successful author , his greatest success was posthumous , with the television adaptations of his stories the darling buds of may and its sequels as well as adaptations of my uncle silas , a moment in time , fair stood the wind for france and love for lydia . in his home town of rushden , h.e . bates has a road named after him to the west of the town , leading to the local leisure centre . bibliography . novels . the two sisters ( 1926 ) catherine foster ( 1929 ) charlotte 's row ( 1931 ) the fallow land ( 1932 ) a german idyll ( 1932 ) the poacher ( 1935 ) the duet ( 1935 ) a house of women ( 1936 ) spella ho ( 1938 ) fair stood the wind for france ( 1944 ) the cruise of the breadwinner ( 1946 ) the purple plain ( 1947 ) the jacaranda tree ( 1949 ) the scarlet sword ( 1950 ) the grass god ( 1951 ) love for lydia ( 1952 ) the feast of july ( 1954 ) the sleepless moon ( 1956 ) a crown of wild myrtle ( 1962 ) a moment in time ( 1964 ) the distant horns of summer ( 1967 ) the triple echo ( 1970 ) . pop larkin series . the darling buds of may ( 1958 ) a breath of french air ( 1959 ) when the green woods laugh ( 1960 ) oh ! to be in england ( 1963 ) a little of what you fancy ( 1970 ) . short stories . the spring song and in view of the fact that ( 1927 ) day 's end and other stories ( 1928 ) seven tales and alexander ( 1929 ) the tree ( 1930 ) the hessian prisoner ( 1930 ) charlotte esmond ( 1930 ) republished as mrs esmond 's life ( 1931 ) a threshing day for esther ( 1931 ) sally go round the moon ( 1932 ) the black boxer ( 1932 ) the story without an end ( 1932 ) the house with the apricot ( 1933 ) time ( 1933 ) the lily ( 1933 ) the woman who had imagination ( 1934 ) cut and come again ( 1935 ) something short and sweet ( 1936 ) the ox ( 1939 ) the flying goat ( 1939 ) i am not myself ( 1939 ) the beauty of the dead ( 1940 ) the greatest people in the world ( 1942 ) as flying officer x how sleep the brave ( 1943 ) as flying officer x bride comes to evensford ( 1943 ) dear life ( 1949 ) colonel julien ( 1951 ) the nature of love ( 1953 ) the daffodil sky ( 1955 ) death of a huntsman ( 1957 ) the watercress girl ( 1959 ) now sleeps the crimson petal ( 1961 ) the day of the tortoise ( 1961 ) the fabulous mrs v ( 1964 ) the four beauties ( 1968 ) the song of the wren ( 1972 ) the yellow meads of asphodel ( 1976 ) . short story collections . thirty tales ( 1934 ) country tales ( 1938 ) the bride comes to evensford and other tales ( 1949 ) an aspidistra in babylon ( 1960 ) the golden oriole ( 1962 ) seven by five ( 1963 ) the wedding party ( 1965 ) the wild cherry tree ( 1968 ) the good corn and other stories ( 1974 ) a party for the girls ( 1988 ) love in a wych elm and other stories ( 2009 ) . uncle silas series . my uncle silas ( 1939 ) sugar for the horse ( 1957 ) . drama . the last bread ( 1926 ) ( one act play ) the day of glory ( 1945 ) . essays and non-fiction . flowers and faces ( 1935 ) through the woods ( 1936 ) down the river ( 1937 ) the seasons & the gardener ( 1940 ) in the heart of the country ( 1942 ) o more than happy countryman ( 1943 ) war pictures by british artists ( 1943 ) country life ( 1943 ) there 's freedom in the air ( 1944 ) flying bombs over england ( 1945 ) also published as '' the battle of the flying bomb .
