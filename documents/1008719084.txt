Hall & Oates

1983–1984 : rock ' n soul part 1 . by the fall of 1983 , hall and oates were one of the biggest pop music acts in the united states . they had five number 1 singles to their credit , two consecutive top 10 albums and were one of the biggest names on mtv . two covers of the 1957 bobby helms classic '' jingle bell rock '' were recorded—one with hall on lead vocals , and the other with oates on lead vocals—and released in time for christmas 1983 , complete with a humorous video of the band , that received extensive airplay on mtv . in 1983 , they released their first greatest hits album entitled rock ' n soul part 1 . the album peaked at number 7 , and the two new songs that were written and recorded for that lp also became top 10 hits as well . the first single released from this album , '' say it is n't so '' , battled six weeks for the number 1 spot with paul mccartney and michael jackson 's '' say say say '' at the peak of thriller mania . '' say it is n't so '' remained at number 2 for an impressive four weeks from december 1983 to january 1984 . hall and oates ' follow-up single '' adult education '' received heavy airplay at both pop and black ( urban contemporary ) radio , and reached number 8 on the billboard hot 100 in april 1984 . it was accompanied by a dark , new york city-oriented music video set in a cave . oates later told vh1 that the clip resembled the survivor tv show on acid . 1984–1985 : big bam boom . hall and oates returned to the studio in 1984 after a rest period to begin work on the big bam boom album . this album had even more of an electronic , urban feel to it than h 2 o , combining their song structure and vocalization with the latest technical advances in recording and playing . the album employed some of the most sophisticated equipment ever used in the recording industry at the time ( most notably the synclavier ii , one of the first computerized synthesizer workstations , as well as the fairlight cmi ) . noted remix and hip-hop icon arthur baker worked very closely with the duo as a consultant , and produced dance remixes of four of the album 's singles . the lead-off song '' dance on your knees '' ( written by hall and baker ) is basically an homage to grandmaster flash and the furious five 's song '' white lines ( do n't do n't do it ) '' . released in late 1984 , the first single from the lp , '' out of touch '' , became the group 's sixth number 1 hit on december 8 , 1984 . '' method of modern love '' , which debuted on the pop charts while '' out of touch '' was at number 1 , reached number 5 in february 1985 . '' some things are better left unsaid '' reached number 18 , and '' possession obsession '' ( a song in which oates sings lead ) reached number 30 in 1985 as well . the group 's '' live thru '85 '' tour to promote the album began in november 1984 , sponsored by pontiac 's latest sports car , the fiero . in addition , pontiac allowed oates , a skilled amateur racer , to drive in pontiac 's factory imsa gtu race car in camel gt pro races . in april 1984 , the recording industry association of america named hall & oates the most successful duo in rock history . . 1985–1988 : live at the apollo/other projects . hall and oates have almost always toured extensively for each album release . but in 1985 , the duo took a break after the release of their live at the apollo album with david ruffin and eddie kendricks—voices of the temptations and two of their heroes . this was rca 's second attempt at a live hall and oates album , following the 1978 release livetime . live at the apollo was released primarily to fulfill the duo 's contract with rca , and contained a top 20 grammy-nominated hit with a medley of '' the way you do the things you do '' and '' my girl '' ; ruffin and kendrick had originally recorded both songs with the temptations in 1964 . hall and oates had collaborated on the usa for africa '' we are the world '' project , with the former as one of the soloists and the latter as a chorus member , and performed at the live aid concert in philadelphia , with ruffin and kendrick . the hall and oates band also backed up mick jagger 's performance at this show . hall , oates , ruffin and kendrick performed again at the mtv video music awards in new york later that year , complete with an apollo theater-style marquee descending on the stage during their performance . in may 1985 , hall and oates performed at the nashville municipal auditorium . just prior to live aid , on july 4 , they participated in liberty concert , an outdoor benefit concert at liberty state park in jersey city , new jersey for the restoration of the statue of liberty . it became a major music event , drawing an estimated crowd of over 60,000 people . in 1986 , hall scored a top 5 us hit with '' dreamtime '' , from his solo album three hearts in the happy ending machine . that album also included the top 40 hit '' foolish pride '' and the top 100 hit '' somebody like you , '' later performed by the duo live on their '' behind the music '' set . although oates did not have a solo hit as a singer , he did contribute a solo track to the film about last night and co-wrote ( with iva davies ) and performed backing vocals on the 1987 icehouse top 10 us hit '' electric blue .
