PowerPC 7xx

processors . powerpc 740/750 . the powerpc 740 and 750 ( codename arthur ) gwennap 1997 were introduced in late 1997 as an evolutionary replacement for the powerpc 603e . enhancements included a faster 60x system bus ( 66 & nbsp ; mhz ) , larger l1 caches ( 32 kb instruction and 32 kb data ) , a second integer unit , an enhanced floating point unit , and higher core frequency . the 750 had support for an optional 256 , 512 or 1024 kb external unified l2 cache . the cache controller and cache tags are on-die . the cache was accessed via a dedicated 64-bit bus . the 740 and 750 added branch predictor and a 64-entry branch target instruction cache ( btic ) . dynamic branch prediction uses the recorded outcome of a branch stored in a 512-entry by 2-bit branch history table ( bht ) to predict its outcome . the btic caches the first two instructions at a branch target . the 740/750 models had 6.35 million transistors and were initially manufactured by ibm and motorola in an aluminium based fabrication process . the die measured 67 & nbsp ; mm 2 at 0.26 & nbsp ; μm and it reached speeds of up to 366 & nbsp ; mhz while consuming 7.3 & nbsp ; w . in 1999 , ibm fabricated versions in a 0.20 & nbsp ; μm process with copper interconnects , which increased the frequency up to 500 & nbsp ; mhz and decreased power consumption to 6 & nbsp ; w and the die size to 40 & nbsp ; mm 2 . the 740 slightly outperformed the pentium ii while consuming far less power and with a smaller die . the off-die l2 cache of the 750 increased performance by approximately 30 % in most situations . the design was so successful that it quickly surpassed the powerpc 604e in integer performance , causing a planned 604 successor to be scrapped . the powerpc 740 is completely pin compatible with the older 603 , allowing upgrades to the powerbook 1400 , 2400 , and even a prototype powerbook 500/g3 . the 750 with its l2 cache bus required more pins and thus a different package , a 360-pin ball grid array ( bga ) . the powerpc 750 was used in many computers from apple , including the original imac . rad750 . the rad750 is a radiation-hardened processor , based on the powerpc 750 . it is intended for use in high radiation environments such as experienced on board satellites and other spacecraft . the rad750 was released for purchase in 2001 . the mars science laboratory ( curiosity ) , mars reconnaissance orbiter , and mars 2020 ( perseverance ) spacecraft have a rad750 on board . the processor has 10.4 million transistors , is manufactured by bae systems using either 250 or 150 & nbsp ; nm process and has a die area of 130 & nbsp ; mm² . it operates at 110 to 200 & nbsp ; mhz . the cpu itself can withstand 200,000 to 1,000,000 rads and temperature ranges between −55 and 125 & nbsp ; °c . the rad750 packaging and logic functions has a price tag in excess of us 200,000 : the high price is mainly due to radiation hardening revisions to the powerpc 750 architecture and manufacturing , stringent quality control requirements , and extended testing of each processor chip manufactured . powerpc 745/755 . motorola revised the 740/750 design in 1998 and shrunk die size to 51 & nbsp ; mm 2 thanks to a newer aluminium based fabrication at 0.22 μm . the speeds increased to up to 600 & nbsp ; mhz . the 755 was used in some ibook models . after this model , motorola chose not to keep developing the 750 processors in favour of their powerpc g4 processor and other cores . powerpc 750cx . ibm continued to develop the powerpc 750 line and introduced the powerpc 750cx ( code-named sidewinder ) in 2000 . it has a 256 kib on-die l2 cache ; this increased performance while reducing power consumption and complexity . at 400 & nbsp ; mhz , it drew under 4 w . the 750cx had 20 million transistors including its l2 cache . it had a die size of 43 & nbsp ; mm 2 through a 0.18 μm copper process . the 750cx was only used in one imac and ibook revision . powerpc 750cxe . 750cxe ( codename anaconda ) , introduced in 2001 , was a minor revision of 750cx which increased its frequency up to 700 and memory bus from 100 & nbsp ; mhz to 133 & nbsp ; mhz . the 750cxe also featured improved floating-point performance over the 750cx . several ibook models and the last g3-based imac used this processor . a cost reduced version of 750cxe , called 750cxr , is available at lower frequencies . gekko . gekko is the custom central processor for the nintendo gamecube game console . it is based on a powerpc 750cxe and adds about 50 new instructions as well as a modified fpu capable of some simd functionality . it has 256 kib of on die l2 cache , operates at 485 & nbsp ; mhz with a 162 & nbsp ; mhz memory bus , is fabricated by ibm on a 180 & nbsp ; nm process . the die is 43 & nbsp ; mm 2 large . powerpc 750fx . the 750fx ( code-named sahara ) came in 2002 and increased frequency up to 900 & nbsp ; mhz , the bus speed to 166 & nbsp ; mhz and the on-die l2 cache to 512 kib . it also featured a number of improvements to the memory subsystem : an enhanced and faster ( 200 & nbsp ; mhz ) 60x bus controller , a wider l2 cache bus , and the ability to lock parts of the l2 cache . it is manufactured using a 0.13 μm copper based fabrication with low-k and silicon on insulator technology . 750fx has 39 million transistors , a die size of 35 & nbsp ; mm 2 and consumes less than 4 w at 800 & nbsp ; mhz at typical loads . it was the last g3 type processor used by apple ( employed on the ibook g3 ) . a low powered version of 750fx is available called 750fl . 750fx powers nasa 's orion spacecraft . orion is using honeywell international inc . flight computer originally built for boeing 's 787 jet airliner . powerpc 750gx . 750gx ( codenamed gobi ) , revealed in 2004 , was a 7xx processor from ibm . it has an on-die 1 & nbsp ; mb l2 cache , a top frequency of 1.1 & nbsp ; ghz , and support for bus speeds up to 200 & nbsp ; mhz among other enhancements compared to 750fx . it is manufactured using a 0.13 & nbsp ; μm process with copper interconnects , low-k , and silicon on insulator technology . the 750gx has 44 million transistors , a die size of 52 & nbsp ; mm 2 and consumes less than 9 & nbsp ; w at 1 & nbsp ; ghz at typical loads . a low-power version of the 750gx is available , called the 750gl . powerpc 750vx . 750vx ( codenamed '' mojave '' ) is a rumored , not confirmed and canceled version of the 7xx line . it would be the most powerful and featured version to date with up to 4mb of off die l3 cache , a 400mhz ddr front side bus and the same implementation of altivec used in the powerpc 970 . it was expected to clock as high as 1.8 & nbsp ; ghz ( starting at 1.5 & nbsp ; ghz ) and reported to have additional pipeline stages , and advanced power management features . it was reported to be finished and ready for production in december 2003 , but said timing was too late for it to get significant orders seeing apple 's ibook line had switched to g4s in october the same year , and thus it quickly fell off the roadmap . it was never released or heard from since . there were follow up chips planned , such the 750vxe , which would have surpassed 2 & nbsp ; ghz . powerpc 750cl . the 750cl is an evolved 750cxe , with speeds ranging from 400 & nbsp ; mhz to 1 & nbsp ; ghz with a system bus up to 240 & nbsp ; mhz , l2 cache prefetch features and graphics related instructions have been added to improve performance . as the added graphics-related functions match closely the ones found in the gekko processor it is very likely that the 750cl is a shrink of the same processor for general purpose use . the 750cl is manufactured using a 90 & nbsp ; nm copper based fabrication with low-k and silicon on insulator technology and features 20 million transistors on a 16 & nbsp ; mm 2 die . it draws up to 2.7 w at 600 & nbsp ; mhz , 9.8 w at 1 & nbsp ; ghz . ibm powerpc 750cl microprocessor revision level dd2.x ibm powerpc 750cl risc microprocessor user ’ s manual . broadway . the cpu in wii is virtually identical to the 750cl but it runs at 729 & nbsp ; mhz , a frequency not supported by stock 750cl . it measures only 4.2 x 4.5 & nbsp ; mm ( 18.9 & nbsp ; mm 2 ) . this is smaller than half the size of the '' gekko '' microprocessor ( 43 & nbsp ; mm 2 ) incorporated in the gamecube at its first release . ibm broadway risc microprocessor user ’ s manual , v0.6 . espresso . the cpu in wii u is believed to be an evolution of the broadway architecture . the largely unconfirmed characteristics are a triple core cpu which runs at 1.24 & nbsp ; ghz and is manufactured on a 45 & nbsp ; nm process . future . ibm has ceased to publish a roadmap to the 750 family , in favor of marketing themselves as a custom processor vendor . given ibm 's resources , the 750 core will be produced with new features as long as there is a willing buyer . in particular , ibm has no public plans to produce an ordinary 750-based microprocessor in a process smaller than 90 nm , effectively phasing it out as a commodity chip competitive in such markets as networking equipment . however ibm did make the espresso processor for nintendo , which is a 750 based design with improvements such as multiprocessor support ( the part is a triple core ) , new 45 & nbsp ; nm fabrication process and edram instead of regular l2 cache ; it 's unknown if further changes were made to the design . in 2015 rochester electronics started providing legacy support for the devices . freescale has discontinued all 750 designs in favor of designs based on the powerpc e500 core ( powerquicc ) . device list . this list is a complete list of known 750 based designs . the pictures are illustrations and not to scale .
