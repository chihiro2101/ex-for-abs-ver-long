Royal College of Music

history . background . the college was founded in 1883 to replace the short-lived and unsuccessful national training school for music ( ntsm ) . the school was the result of an earlier proposal by the prince consort to provide free musical training to winners of scholarships under a nationwide scheme . after many years ' delay it was established in 1876 , with arthur sullivan as its principal . conservatoires to train young students for a musical career had been set up in major european cities , but in london the long-established royal academy of music had not supplied suitable training for professional musicians : in 1870 it was estimated that fewer than ten per cent of instrumentalists in london orchestras had studied at the academy . wright , david '' the south kensington music schools and the development of the british conservatoire in the late nineteenth century '' , journal of the royal musical association , vol . 130 , no . 2 ( 2005 ) , pp . 236–282 the ntsm 's aim , summarised in its founding charter , was : the school was housed in a new building in kensington gore , opposite the west side of the royal albert hall . the building was not large , having only 18 practice rooms and no concert hall . in a 2005 study of the ntsm and its replacement by the rcm , david wright observes that the building is '' more suggestive of a young ladies ' finishing school than a place for the serious training of professional musicians '' . under sullivan , a reluctant and ineffectual principal , the ntsm failed to provide a satisfactory alternative to the royal academy and , by 1880 , a committee of examiners comprising charles hallé , julius benedict , sir michael costa , henry leslie and otto goldschmidt reported that the school lacked '' executive cohesion '' . the following year sullivan resigned and was replaced by john stainer . in his 2005 study of the ntsm , wright comments : even before the 1880 report , it had become clear that the ntsm would not fulfil the role of national music conservatoire . as early as 13 july 1878 , a meeting was held at marlborough house , london under the presidency of the edward vii , '' for the purpose of taking into consideration the advancement of the art of music and establishing a college of music on a permanent and more extended basis than that of any existing institution '' . the original plan was to merge the royal academy of music and the national training school of music into a single , enhanced organisation . the ntsm agreed , but after prolonged negotiations , the royal academy refused to enter into the proposed scheme . '' the proposed college for music '' , the musical times and singing class circular , vol . 23 , no . 467 ( january 1882 ) , pp . 17–18 in 1881 , with george grove as a leading instigator and with the support of the prince of wales , a draft charter was drawn up for a successor body to the ntsm . the royal college of music occupied the premises previously home to the ntsm and opened there on 7 may 1883 . grove was appointed its first director .
