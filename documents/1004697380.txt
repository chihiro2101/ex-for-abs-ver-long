Colin Wilson

early life . wilson was born on 26 june 1931 in leicester , the first child of arthur and annetta wilson . his father worked in a shoe factory . colin wilson , dreaming to some purpose ( arrow , 2005 ) at the age of eleven he attended gateway secondary technical school , where his interest in science began to blossom . by the age of 14 he had compiled a multi-volume work of essays covering many aspects of science entitled a manual of general science . but by the time he left school at sixteen , his interests were already switching to literature . his discovery of george bernard shaw 's work , particularly man and superman , was a landmark . he started to write stories , plays , and essays in earnest – a long '' sequel '' to man and superman made him consider himself to be 'shaw 's natural successor . ' after two unfulfilling jobs – one as a laboratory assistant at his old school – he drifted into the civil service , but found little to occupy his time . in the autumn of 1949 , he was conscripted into the royal air force but soon found himself clashing with authority , eventually feigning homosexuality in order to be dismissed . upon leaving he took up a succession of menial jobs , spent some time wandering around europe , and finally returned to leicester in 1951 . there he married his first wife , ( dorothy ) betty troop , and moved to london , where a son was born . but the marriage rapidly disintegrated as he drifted in and out of several jobs . during this traumatic period , wilson was continually working and reworking the novel that was eventually published as ritual in the dark ( 1960 ) . colin wilson 's 'ritual in the dark ' he also met three young writers who became close friends – bill hopkins , stuart holroyd and laura del rivo . laura del rivo 'the furnished room ' another trip to europe followed , and he spent some time in paris attempting to sell magazine subscriptions . returning to leicester again , he met joy stewart – later to become his second wife and mother of their three children – who accompanied him to london . there he continued to work on ritual in the dark , receiving some advice from angus wilson ( no relation ) – then deputy superintendent of the british museum reading room – and slept rough ( in a sleeping bag ) on hampstead heath to save money . desert island discs archive : 1976–1980 on christmas day , 1954 , alone in his room , he sat down on his bed and began to write in his journal . he described his feelings as follows : . the outsider . gollancz published the 24-year-old wilson 's the outsider in 1956 . the work examines the role of the social '' outsider '' in seminal works by various key literary and cultural figuressuch as albert camus , jean-paul sartre , ernest hemingway , hermann hesse , fyodor dostoyevsky , william james , t . e . lawrence , vaslav nijinsky and vincent van goghand discusses wilson 's perception of social alienation in their work . the book became a best-seller and helped popularise existentialism in britain . kenneth allsop , the angry decade ; a survey of the cultural revolt of the nineteen fifties . london : peter owen ltd . it has never been out of print and has been translated into more than thirty languages . the back cover of the 2001 paperback edition reads : . career . non-fiction writing . wilson became associated with the '' angry young men '' of british literature . he contributed to declaration , an anthology of manifestos by writers associated with the movement , and was also anthologised in a popular paperback sampler , protest : the beat generation and the angry young men . some viewed wilson and his friends bill hopkins and stuart holroyd as a sub-group of the '' angries '' , more concerned with '' religious values '' than with liberal or socialist politics . critics on the left swiftly labelled them as fascist ; commentator kenneth allsop called them '' the law givers '' . controversially , during the 1950s wilson expressed critical support for some of the ideas of oswald mosley the leader of union movement and after mosley 's death in december 1980 , wilson contributed articles to his former secretary jeffrey hamm 's lodestar magazine . skidelsky , robert oswald mosley p.503 , p.511 , lodestar no.1-winter 1985/86 , no.4-autumn/winter 1986 , no.7-winter 1987/88 , no.8-spring 1988 , no.9-summer 1988 , no.11-spring 1989 , no.12-summer 1989 the success of the outsider notwithstanding , wilson 's second book , religion and the rebel ( 1957 ) , was universally panned by critics although wilson himself claimed it was a more comprehensive book than the first one . while the outsider was focused on documenting the subject of mental strain and near-insanity , religion and the rebel was focused on how to expand our consciousness and transform us into visionaries . time magazine published a review , headlined '' scrambled egghead '' , that pilloried the book . colin wilson , the angry years robson books , 2007 undaunted , wilson continued to expound his positive '' new '' existentialism in the six philosophical books known as '' the outsider cycle '' , all written within the first ten years of his literary career . these books were summarised by introduction to the new existentialism ( 1966 ) . when the book was re-printed in 1980 as the new existentialism , wilson wrote : '' if i have contributed anything to existentialism – or , for that matter , to twentieth century thought in general , here it is . i am willing to stand or fall by it . '' in the age of defeat ( 1959 ) – book 3 of '' the outsider cycle '' – he bemoaned the loss of the hero in twentieth century life and literature ; convinced that we were becoming embroiled in what he termed '' the fallacy of insignificance '' . it was this theory that encouraged celebrated american psychologist abraham maslow to contact him in 1963 . the two corresponded regularly and met on several occasions before maslow 's death in 1970 . wilson wrote a biography and assessment of maslow 's work , new pathways in psychology : maslow and the post-freudian revolution , based on audiotapes that maslow had provided , which was published in 1972 . maslow 's observation of '' peak experiences '' in his students – those sudden moments of overwhelming happiness that we all experience from time to time – provided wilson with an important clue in his search for the mechanism that might control the outsider 's '' moments of vision '' . maslow , however , was convinced that peak experiences could not be induced ; colin wilson thought otherwise and , indeed , in later books like access to inner worlds ( 1983 ) and super consciousness ( 2009 ) , suggested how they could be induced at will . wilson was also known for what he termed '' existential criticism '' , which suggested that a work of art should not just be judged by the principles of literary criticism or theory alone but also by what it has to say , in particular about the meaning and purpose of existence . in his pioneering essay for chicago review ( volume 13 , no . 2 , 1959 , pp . & nbsp ; 152–181 ) he wrote : no art can be judged by purely aesthetic standards , although a painting or a piece of music may appear to give a purely aesthetic pleasure . aesthetic enjoyment is an intensification of the vital response , and this response forms the basis of all value judgements . the existentialist contends that all values are connected with the problems of human existence , the stature of man , the purpose of life . these values are inherent in all works of art , in addition to their aesthetic values , and are closely connected with them . he went on to write several more essays and books on the subject . among the latter were the strength to dream ( 1962 ) , eagle and earwig ( 1965 ) , poetry and mysticism ( 1970 ) the craft of the novel ( 1975 ) , the bicameral critic ( 1985 ) and the books in my life ( 1998 ) . he also applied existential criticism to many of the hundreds of book reviews he wrote for journals including books & bookmen , the literary review , the london magazine , john o'london 's , the spectator and the aylesford review throughout his career . some of these were gathered together in a book entitled existential criticism : selected book reviews , published in 2009 . meanwhile , the prolific wilson found time to write about other subjects that interested him , even on occasion when his level of expertise might be questionable . the title of his opinionated 1964 volume on music appreciation , brandy of the damned , inspired by his enthusiasm for record collecting , eric sams . 'colin wilson on music ' in the musical times , april 1967 , p 329-330 used for its title a self deprecating reference from the one-time music critic bernard shaw . the full quote ( from man and superman ) is : '' “ hell is full of musical amateurs : music is the brandy of the damned . may not one lost soul be permitted to abstain ? ” by the late 1960s wilson had become increasingly interested in metaphysics and occult themes . in 1971 , he published the occult : a history , featuring exegesis on aleister crowley , george gurdjieff , helena blavatsky , kabbalah , primitive magic , franz mesmer , grigori rasputin , daniel dunglas home and paracelsus , among others . he also wrote a markedly unsympathetic biography of crowley , aleister crowley : the nature of the beast , and has written biographies on other spiritual and psychological visionary , including gurdjieff , carl jung , wilhelm reich , rudolf steiner , and p . d . ouspensky . originally , wilson focused on the cultivation of what he called '' faculty x '' , which he saw as leading to an increased sense of meaning , and on abilities such as telepathy and the awareness of other energies . in his later work he suggests the possibility of afterlife and the existence of spirits , which he personally analyses as an active member of the ghost club . he also wrote non-fiction books on crime , ranging from encyclopedias to studies of serial killing . he had an ongoing interest in the life and times of jack the ripper and in sex crime in general . fiction . wilson explored his ideas on aptitude and consciousness in fiction , mostly detective fiction or science fiction , including several cthulhu mythos pieces ; often writing a non-fiction work and a novel concurrently – as a way of putting his ideas into action . he wrote : like some of his non-fiction work , many of wilson 's novels from ritual in the dark ( 1960 ) onwards have been concerned with the psychology of murder—especially that of serial killing . however , he has also written science fiction of a philosophical bent , including the mind parasites ( 1967 ) , the philosopher 's stone ( 1969 ) , the space vampires ( 1976 ) and the four-volume spider-world series : spider world : the tower ( 1987 ) , spider world : the delta ( 1987 ) , spider world : the magician ( 1992 ) and spider world : shadowland ( 2003 ) ; novels described by one critic as '' an artistic achievement of the highest order . destined to be regarded to be one of the central products of the twentieth century imagination . '' howard f dossor : colin wilson : the man and his mind , element , 1990 , p . 284 wilson wrote the spider world series in response to a suggestion made to him by roald dahl to 'write a novel for children . ' he also said he 'd 'like to be remembered as the man who wrote spider world . in the strength to dream ( 1961 ) wilson attacked h . p . lovecraft as '' sick '' and as '' a bad writer '' who had '' rejected reality '' —but he grudgingly praised lovecraft 's story '' the shadow out of time '' as capable science fiction . august derleth , incensed by wilson 's treatment of lovecraft in the strength to dream , then dared wilson to write what became the mind parasites—to expound his philosophical ideas in the guise of fiction . in the preface to the mind parasites , wilson concedes that lovecraft , '' far more than hemingway or faulkner , or even kafka , is a symbol of the outsider-artist in the 20th century '' and asks : '' what would have happened if lovecraft had possessed a private income—enough , say , to allow him to spend his winters in italy and his summers in greece or switzerland ? '' answering that in his wilson 's opinion '' he would undoubtedly have produced less , but what he did produce would have been highly polished , without the pulp magazine cliches that disfigure so much of his work . and he would have given free rein to his love of curious and remote erudition , so that his work would have been , in some respect , closer to that of anatole france or the contemporary argentinian writer jorge luis borges '' . wilson also discusses lovecraft in order of assassins ( 1972 ) and in the prefatory note to the philosopher 's stone ( 1969 ) . his short novel the return of the lloigor ( 1969/1974 ) also has roots in the cthulhu mythos – its central character works on the real book the voynich manuscript , but discovers it to be a mediaeval arabic version of the necronomicon – as does his 2002 novel the tomb of the old ones . adaptations . tobe hooper directed the film lifeforce , based on wilson 's novel the space vampires . after its release , colin wilson recalled that author john fowles regarded the film adaptation of fowles ' own novel the magus as the worst film adaptation of a novel ever . wilson told fowles there was now a worse one . a film of his 1961 novel adrift in soho by director pablo behrens was released by burning films in 2018 . illness and death . after a major spinal operation in 2011 , wilson suffered a stroke and lost his ability to speak . he was admitted to hospital in october 2013 for pneumonia . he died on 5 december 2013 and was buried in the churchyard at gorran churchtown in cornwall . a memorial service for him was held at st james 's church , piccadilly , london , on 14 october 2014 . reception . howard f . dossor wrote : '' wilson constitutes one of the most significant challenges to twentieth-century critics . it seems most likely that critics analysing his work in the middle of the twenty-first century , will be puzzled that his contemporaries paid such inadequate attention to him . but it is not merely for their sake that he should be examined . critics who turn to him will find themselves involved in the central questions of our age and will be in touch with a mind that has disclosed an extraordinary resilience in addressing them . '' howard f . dossor colin wilson : the man and his mind ( 1990 ) element books , pp 318–319 . critic nicolas tredell wrote : '' the twenty-first century may look back on colin wilson as one of the novelists who foresaw the future of fiction , and something , perhaps , of the future of man .

'' gardner described wilson 's book the geller phenomenon as '' the most gullible book ever written about the israeli charlatan '' . gardner concluded that wilson had decayed into an '' occult eccentric '' writing books for the '' lunatic fringe '' . martin gardner ( 1984 ) . order and surprise . oxford university press . pp . 361–364 . the psychologist dorothy rowe gave wilson 's book men of mystery a negative review and wrote that it '' does nothing to advance research into the paranormal '' . benjamin radford has written that wilson had a '' bias toward mystery-mongering '' and that he ignored scientific and skeptical arguments on some of the topics he wrote about . radford described wilson 's book the mammoth encyclopedia of the unsolved as '' riddled with errors and obfuscating omissions , betraying a bizarre disregard for accuracy '' . benjamin radford ( 2013 ) .

'' michael dirda in the washington post called wilson a '' controversial writer who explored the nature of human consciousness in dozens of books '' and said that lachman , a '' leading student of the western esoteric tradition , writes with '' exceptional grace , forcefulness , and clarity .
