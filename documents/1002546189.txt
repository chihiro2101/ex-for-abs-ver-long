Hongwu Emperor

japanese '' pirates . hongwu sent a harsh message to the japanese that his army would '' capture and exterminate wokou , head straight for your country , and put your king in bonds '' . in fact , many of the '' wokou '' and '' dongyi '' raiding his coasts were chinese , . and hongwu 's response was almost entirely passive . the ashikaga shōgun cheekily replied '' your great empire may be able to invade japan , but our small state is not short of a strategy to defend ourselves . '' . the necessity of protecting his state against the northern yuan remnants . meant that the most hongwu was able to accomplish against japan was a series of '' haijin '' measures . private foreign trade was made punishable by death , with the collective punishment ; . ships , docks , and shipyards were destroyed , and ports were sabotaged . . the plan 's aim seems to have been to use japan 's need for chinese goods to force them to terms . the plan was at odds with chinese tradition and extremely counterproductive as it tied up resources . for example , 74 coastal garrisons had to be established from guangzhou to shandong , though they were often manned by local gangs . hongwu 's measures limited tax receipts , impoverished and provoked both coastal chinese and japanese against the hongwu regime , and actually increased piracy- . offering too little as a reward for good behavior and enticement for japanese authorities to root out their own smugglers and pirates . regardless of the policy , piracy had dropped to negligible levels by the time of its abolition in 1568 . nonetheless , the sea ban was added by hongwu to his ancestral injunctions and so continued to be broadly enforced through most of the rest of his dynasty : for the next two centuries , the rich farmland of the south and the military theaters of the north were linked only by the jinghang canal . . despite the deep distrust , in hongwu 's ancestral injunctions , he listed japan along with 14 other countries as '' countries against which campaigns shall not be launched '' , and advised his descendants to maintain peace with them . . byzantine empire . the history of ming , compiled during the early qing dynasty , describes how hongwu met with an alleged merchant of fulin ( 拂菻 ; the byzantine empire ) named '' nieh-ku-lun '' . in september 1371 , he had the man sent back to his native country with a letter announcing the history of the ming dynasty to his ruler ( i.e . john v palaiologos ) . it is speculated that the merchant was actually a former bishop of khanbaliq ( beijing ) called nicolaus de bentra , sent by pope john xxii to replace archbishop john of montecorvino in 1333 . the history of ming goes on to explain that contacts between china and fu lin ceased after this point , and diplomats of the great western sea ( the mediterranean sea ) did not appear in china again until the 16th century , with the italian jesuit missionary matteo ricci . . death . after a 30-year reign , the hongwu emperor died on 24 june 1398 at the age of 69 . after his death , his physicians were penalized . he was buried at ming xiaoling mausoleum on the purple mountain , in the east of nanjing . the mass sacrifice of concubines after the emperor 's death , a practice long disappeared among chinese dynasties , was revived by zhu yuanzhang , probably to clear potential obstacles to the reign of his chosen successor . at least 38 concubines were killed as part of hongwu 's human sacrifice china . . assessment . historians consider hongwu as one of the most significant emperors of china . as patricia buckley ebrey puts it , '' seldom has the course of chinese history been influenced by a single personality as much as it was by the founder of the ming dynasty , zhu yuanzhang . '' ebrey , '' cambridge illustrated history of china '' , pg . 190 his rise to power was fast despite his having a poor and humble origin . in 11 years , he went from being a penniless monk to the most powerful warlord in china . five years later , he became emperor of china . simon leys described him this way : 'an adventurer from peasant stock , poorly educated , a man of action , a bold and shrewd tactician , a visionary mind , in many respects a creative genius ; naturally coarse , cynical , and ruthless , he eventually showed symptoms of paranoia , bordering on psychopathy .
