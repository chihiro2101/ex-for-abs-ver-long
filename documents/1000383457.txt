Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari

life . ermanno wolf-ferrari was born in venice in 1876 , the son of german painter august wolf and emilia ferrari , from venice . he added his mother 's maiden-name , ferrari , to his surname in 1895 . although he studied piano from an early age , music was not the primary passion of his young life . as a teenager wolf-ferrari wanted to be a painter like his father ; he studied intensively in venice and rome and traveled abroad to study in munich . it was there that he decided to concentrate instead on music , taking lessons from josef rheinberger . he enrolled at the munich conservatory and began taking counterpoint and composition classes . these initially casual music classes eventually completely eclipsed his art studies , and music took over wolf-ferrari 's life . he wrote his first works in the 1890s . at age 19 , wolf-ferrari left the conservatory and traveled home to venice . there he worked as a choral conductor , married , had a son called federico wolf-ferrari , and met both arrigo boito and verdi . in 1900 , having failed to have two previous efforts published , wolf-ferrari saw the first performance of one of his operas , cenerentola , based on the story of cinderella . the opera was a failure in italy , and the humiliated young composer moved back to munich . german audiences would prove more appreciative of his work ; a revised version of cenerentola was a hit in bremen in 1902 , while the cantata la vita nuova brought the young composer international fame . wolf-ferrari now began transforming the wild and witty farces of the 18th-century venetian playwright carlo goldoni into comic operas . the resulting works were musically eclectic , melodic , and utterly hilarious ; every single one became an international success . in fact , until the outbreak of world war i , wolf-ferrari 's operas were among the most performed in the world . in 1902 he became professor of composition and director of the liceo benedetto marcello . in 1911 wolf-ferrari tried his hand at full-blooded verismo with i gioielli della madonna ; a story of passion , sacrilege and madness . it was quite popular in its day and for a period after , especially in chicago , where the great polish soprano rosa raisa made it a celebrated vehicle . maria jeritza ( and , later , florence easton ) triumphed in it at the metropolitan opera , in an all-out spectacular production in 1926 . world war i , however , was a nightmare for wolf-ferrari . the young composer , who had been dividing his time between munich and venice , suddenly found his two countries at war with each other . with the outbreak of the war , he moved to zurich and composed much less , though he still wrote another comedy , gli amanti sposi ( 1916 ) . a new melancholy vein appeared in his post-war work ; his operas grew darker and more emotionally complex . he did not really pick up his rate of output until the 1920s , when he wrote das himmelskleid ( 1925 ) and sly ( 1927 ) , the latter based on william shakespeare 's the taming of the shrew . in 1939 he became professor of composition at the mozarteum in salzburg . in 1946 he moved again to zürich before returning to his home city of venice . he died in venice at palazzo malipiero and is buried in the venetian cemetery island of san michele . music . as well as his operas , wolf-ferrari wrote a number of instrumental works , mainly at the very beginning and very end of his career . only his violin concerto has ever been performed with anything approaching regularity , though he also wrote idillio-concertino ( essentially a chamber symphony ) , various pieces of chamber music including a piano quintet and two piano trios , three violin sonatas and a number of works for the organ amongst others . wolf-ferrari 's work is not performed very widely ( with the exception of several of his overtures and his jewels of the madonna intermezzo ) although he is generally thought of as probably the finest writer of italian comic opera of his time . his works often recall the opera buffa of the 18th century , although he also wrote more ambitious works in the manner of pietro mascagni , which are thought of less well . works . operas . : :see list of operas by ermanno wolf-ferrari . other vocal works . la vita nuova , cantata 1902 4 rispetti , op . 11 4 rispetti , op . 12 canzoniere , op . 17 . orchestral . serenade for strings in e flat major idillio-concertino in a major for oboe and small orchestra , op . 15 ( 1932 ) suite-concertino in f major for bassoon and small orchestra , op . 16 ( 1933 ) venezianische suite ( suite veneziana ) in a minor , op.18 triptychon ( trittico ) op.19 divertimento in d major op.20 arabesken ( arabeschi ) für orchester op.22 ( after a theme of ettore tito ) violin concerto in d , op . 26 guila bustabo in ammirazione ( 1943 ) sinfonia brevis in e flat major op.28 concertino in a flat major for english horn and small orchestra , op . 34 ( 1947 ) . chamber music . string sextet in c minor ( 1894/95 , also as a string trio ) in manuscript , mentioned by hamann in his ermanno wolf-ferrari , ( schneider , 1986 ) . performed in several concerts in germany in 2011 . - see sinfonia da camera op . 8 ( 1901 ) sonata no.1 for violin & piano in g minor , op.1 ( 1895 ) sonata no.2 for violin & piano in a minor , op.10 ( 1901 ) sonata no.3 for violin & piano in e major , op.27 ( 1943 ) sonata for cello & piano in g major , op.30 ( 1945 ) string duo in g minor for violin & cello , op.33b ( 1946 ) string duo , '' introduzio mnjkkjkne e balletto '' , for violin & cello , op.35 ( 1948 ) string trio in b minor for violin , viola & cello , woo .
