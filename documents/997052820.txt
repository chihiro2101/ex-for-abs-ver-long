Conidae

current taxonomy . in the journal of molluscan studies , in 2014 , puillandre , duda , meyer , olivera & bouchet presented a new classification for the old genus conus . using 329 species , the authors carried out molecular phylogenetic analyses . the results suggested that the authors should place all living cone snails in a single family , conidae , containing the following genera : californiconus j . k . tucker & tenorio , 2009 conasprella thiele , 1929 † conilithes swainson , 1840 † contraconus olsson & harbison , 1953 conus linnaeus , 1758 † eoconus j . k . tucker & tenorio , 2009 † hemiconus cossmann , 1889 † herndliconus petuch & drolshagen , 2015 kenyonia brazier , 1896 lilliconus g . raybaudi massilia , 1994 malagasyconus monnier & tenorio , 2015 † papilliconus tracey & craig , 2017 profundiconus kuroda , 1956 pseudolilliconus j . k . tucker & tenorio , 2009 pygmaeconus puillandre & tenorio , 2017 † tequestaconus petuch & drolshagen , 2015 † the authors grouped 85 % of all known cone snail species under conus . they recognized 57 subgenera within conus , and 11 subgenera within the genus conasprella . . history of the taxonomy . overview . prior to 1993 , the family conidae contained only conus species . in 1993 significant taxonomic changes were proposed by taylor , et al . , : taylor j . d . , kantor y . i . & sysoev a . v . ( 1993 ) . '' foregut anatomy , feeding mechanisms , relationships and classification of conoidea ( toxoglossa ) ( gastropoda ) . '' bull . br . mus . ( nat . hist . ) zool . 59 : 125–169 . the family conidae was redefined as several subfamilies . the subfamilies included many subfamilies that had previously been classified in the family turridae , and the conus species were moved to the subfamily coninae . in further taxonomic changes that took place in 2009 and 2011 , based upon molecular phylogeny ( see below ) , the subfamilies that were previously in the family turridae were elevated to the status of families in their own right . this left the family conidae once again containing only those species that were traditionally placed in that family : the cone snail species . 1993 , taylor et al . , bouchet & rocroi . according to taylor , et al . ( 1993 ) , and the taxonomy of the gastropoda ( bouchet & rocroi , 2005 ) , this family consisted of seven subfamilies . coninae fleming , 1822 & nbsp ; — synonyms : conulinae rafinesque , 1815 ( inv . ) ; textiliinae da motta , 1995 ( n.a . ) clathurellinae h . adams & a . adams , 1858 & nbsp ; — synonyms : defranciinae gray , 1853 ( inv . ) ; borsoniinae a . bellardi , 1875 ; pseudotominae a . bellardi , 1888 ; diptychomitrinae l . bellardi , 1888 ; mitrolumnidae sacco , 1904 ; mitromorphinae casey , 1904 ; lorinae thiele , 1925 conorbiinae de gregorio , 1880—synonym : cryptoconinae cossmann , 1896 mangeliinae p . fischer , 1883—synonym : cytharinae thiele , 1929 oenopotinae bogdanov , 1987—synonym : lorinae thiele , 1925 sensu thiele raphitominae a . bellardi , 1875—synonyms : daphnellinae casey , 1904 ; taraninae casey , 1904 ; thatcheriidae powell , 1942 ; pleurotomellinae f . nordsieck , 1968 ; andoniinae vera-pelaez , 2002 † siphopsinae le renard , 1995 . 2009 , tucker & tenorio . in 2009 john k . tucker and manuel j . tenorio proposed a classification system for the cone shells and their allies ( which resorb their inner walls during growth ) was based upon a cladistical analysis of anatomical characters including the radula , the morphology ( i.e . , shell characters ) , as well as an analysis of prior molecular phylogeny studies , all of which were used to construct phylogenetic trees . tucker j.k . & tenorio m.j . ( 2009 ) systematic classification of recent and fossil conoidean gastropods . hackenheim : conchbooks . 296 pp . , at p . 133 in their phylogeny , tucker and tenorio noted the close relationship of the cone species within the various clades , corresponding to their proposed families and genera ; this also corresponded to the results of prior molecular studies by puillandre et al . and others . p.k . bandyopadhyay , b.j . stevenson , j.p . ownby , m.t . cady , m . watkins , & b . olivera ( 2008 ) , the mitochondrial genome of conus textile , coxi-conii intergenic sequences and conoidean evolution . molecular phylogenetics and evolution 46 : 215-223 . s.t . williams & t.f . duda , jr .

( 2011 ) was based on mitochondrial dna and nuclear dna testing , and built on the prior work by j.k . tucker & m.j . tenorio ( 2009 ) , but did not include fossil taxa . molecular phylogeny , particularly with the advent of nuclear dna testing in addition to the mdna testing ( testing in the conidae initially began by christopher meyer and alan kohn interview of professor alan kohn , professor emeritus , zoology ) , is continuing on the conidae . n . puillandre , s . samadi , m . boesselier , a . sysoev , y . kantor , c . cruaud , a . couloux , & p . bouchett ( 2008 ) , starting to unravel the toxoglossan knot : molecular phylogeny of the '' turrid '' ( neogastropoda : conoidea ) , molecular phylogenetics and evolution 47:1122-1134 . tucker , j . k . & stahlschmidt , p .

1993 to 2011 , the family conidae was defined as including not only the cone snails , but also a large number of other genera which are commonly known as turridae . however , as a result of molecular phylogeny studies in 2011 , many of those genera were moved back to the turridae , or were placed in new '' turrid '' families within the superfamily conoidea . the following list of genera that used to be included in conidae is retained as a historical reference : abyssobela kantor & sysoev , 1986 acamptodaphne shuto , 1971 agathotoma cossman , 1899 aliceia dautzenberg & fischer , 1897 antimitra

victims suffer little pain , because the venom contains an analgesic component . some species reportedly can kill a human in under five minutes , thus the name '' cigarette snail '' as supposedly one only has time to smoke a cigarette before dying . cone snails can sting through a wetsuit with their harpoon-like radular tooth , which resembles a transparent needle . normally , cone snails ( and many species in the superfamily conoidea ) use their venom to immobilize prey before engulfing it . the venom consists of a mixture of peptides , called conopeptides . the venom is typically made up of 10 to 30 amino acids , but in some species as many as 60 . the venom of each cone snail species may contain as many as 200 pharmacologically active components . it is estimated that more than 50,000 conopeptides can be found , because every species of cone snail is thought to produce its own specific venom . cone-snail venom has come to interest biotechnologists and pharmacists because of its potential medicinal properties . production of synthetic conopeptides has started , using solid-phase peptide synthesis . w-conopeptide , from the species conus magus is the basis of the analgesic drug prialt , an approved treatment for pain said to be 1000 times as powerful as morphine and used as a last resort in specific application . conopeptides are also being looked at as anti-epileptic agents and to help stop nerve-cell death after a stroke or head injury . conopeptides also have potential in helping against spasms due to spinal cord injuries , and may be helpful in diagnosing and treating small cell carcinomas in the lung . the biotechnology surrounding cone snails and their venom has promise for medical breakthroughs ; with more than 50,000 conotoxin to study , the possibilities are numerous . . see also . conoserver , a database of cone snail toxins , known as conopeptides . these toxins are of importance to medical research . references . further reading .
