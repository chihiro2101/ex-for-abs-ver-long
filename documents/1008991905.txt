Thomas Linacre

life . he was born at brampton , chesterfield , in derbyshire , descended from an ancient family recorded in the domesday book . he received his early education at the canterbury cathedral school , under the direction of william tilly of selling , who became prior of canterbury in 1472 . it was from selling that linacre must have received his first incentive to the study of classics . linacre entered oxford in about 1480 , and in 1484 was elected a fellow of all souls college . shortly afterwards he visited italy in the train of selling , who was sent by king henry vii as an envoy to the papal court . linacre accompanied his patron as far as bologna . there he became the pupil of angelo poliziano , and shared the instruction which poliziano imparted at florence to the sons of lorenzo de medici . the younger of these princes became pope leo x , and later remembered his old companionship with linacre . among his other teachers and friends in italy were demetrius chalcondylas , ermolao barbaro , aldus romanus the printer of venice ( of whose new academy linacre was a member ) , and niccol√≤ leoniceno of vicenza . linacre took the degree of doctor of medicine with great distinction at padua . on his return to oxford , full of the learning and imbued with the spirit of the italian renaissance , he formed one of the brilliant circle of oxford scholars , including john colet , william grocyn and william latimer , who are mentioned in the letters of erasmus . linacre does not appear to have practised or taught medicine in oxford . in about 1501 , he was called to court as tutor of the young arthur , prince of wales . on the accession of henry viii in 1509 , he was appointed the king 's physician , an office at that time of considerable influence and importance , and practised medicine in london , having among his patients most of the great statesmen and prelates of the time , including thomas wolsey , archbishop william warham and bishop fox . after some years of professional activity , linacre devoted himself to the study of theology and the duties of the priesthood . around 1509 , he received priest 's orders as the rector of merstham , kent . numerous ecclesiastical positions followed , finalising with him obtaining the rectorship of wigan in 1520 , which he held until his death in 1524 . his clerical benefices , included the precentorship of york minster . his ordination was connected with his retirement from active life . literary labours , and the cares of the foundation which owed its existence chiefly to him , the royal college of physicians , occupied linacre 's remaining years . the most important service linacre conferred upon his own profession and science was the foundation by royal charter of the college of physicians in london , and he was the first president of the new college , which he further aided by bequeathing to it his own house and library . shortly before his death , linacre obtained from the king letters patent for the establishment of readerships in medicine at oxford and cambridge , and placed valuable estates in the hands of trustees for their endowment . two readerships were founded at merton college , oxford , and a lecture st john 's college , cambridge . the oxford foundation was revived by the university commissioners in 1856 in the form of the linacre chair of zoology . at st john 's college the funds are still in use today ; since 1989 the college has hosted an annual '' linacre lecture '' on a subject in medicine , delivered by a leading research scientist in their field . linacre is listed on a modern monument in the crypt of st paul 's cathedral in london as one of the important graves lost in the great fire of london in 1666 .
