Calvary Cemetery (Los Angeles)

history . old calvary . when los angeles was originally surveyed and mapped under the leadership of gen . edward ord in 1849 , its graveyard was at the upper end of eternity street . at the lower end of eternity was the first church in los angeles , the placita . in between lay a part of town flanked by adobe houses , citrus trees , and coast live oaks suitable for traditional funeral processions escorting believers to eternity . the land allotted to the cemetery lay between a creek a half block north of college street and the toma ( intake of the zanja madre ) beyond the northern edge of town . that cemetery was named calvary . all the important magnates of the country around los angeles were buried at calvary , such as gen . andrés pico , the hero of the battle of san pascual , and don abel stearns , a man of many ranchos . the ravine sloping down from the west took its name ; it was called '' cemetery ravine '' ( now chavez ravine , home of dodger stadium ) . later , a protestant cemetery for los angeles was laid out atop fort hill , where grand arts high school and the cathedral of our lady of the angels are now . during the recent expansion of grand arts , bodies were uncovered and buried elsewhere . as los angeles swelled with settlers , so also did old calvary cemetery grow in size and importance , and a chapel was built . large in scale for the desert southwest of southern california , that chapel was dedicated to the memory of a patron , andrew briswell , who died in 1885 . when conditions led to the founding of a new , even bigger cemetery on the other side of the los angeles river in 1896—in east los angeles—the property of the historic cemetery was put to other uses . at the time , many italians began moving into the north side of los angeles , where they founded a new church on north spring street . so many italians moved in , that the upper part of town became known as '' little italy . '' as it grew , a new , more permanent church building was sought , so parishioners bought the chapel of old calvary cemetery . the first child was baptized there in september 1904 . the chapel was formally established as a church when fr . a . bucci dedicated the chapel of the old cemetery as st . peter 's church on july 4 , 1915 . old calvary 's historic chapel survives today in the parish and buildings of st . peter 's italian catholic church , 1039 n broadway . historic old calvary cemetery was built over and much of it is now occupied by cathedral high school . current plots . the current site across the river and uphill , measuring 137 acres , was dedicated in 1896 . all souls chapel was built on the grounds in 1902 , and was dedicated on all souls ' day of that same year . bishop george thomas montgomery offered a solemn pontifical mass on a temporary altar at the site , and afterwards presided at the setting in place of the cornerstone . it was designed as a replica of the parish church of st . giles in the rural town of stoke poges , buckinghamshire , in england . that church is believed to have been the setting of the famed 18th-century poem elegy written in a country churchyard . the chapel became one of the most visited places of worship in southern california after its opening . all souls chapel is now used primarily for burial services . the main mausoleum , with a new chapel , was built in 1936 . it was designed by architect ross montgomery . online archive of california : ross montgomery john chase , glitter stucco and dumpster diving , verso , 2004 , p . 61 two additional mausoleums , our lady 's garden and gethsemane , have since been built . the cemetery has its own chaplain and daily mass is offered in the chapel of the main mausoleum . . notable burials . kathryn adams ( 1893–1959 ) , actress king baggot ( 1879–1948 ) , actor , screenwriter/director john barrymore ( 1882-1942 ) , stage , screen and radio actor lionel barrymore ( 1878–1954 ) , actor ethel barrymore ( 1879–1959 ) , actress hi bell ( 1897–1949 ) , baseball player eugenie besserer ( 1868–1934 ) , actress francelia billington ( 1895–1934 ) , actress mykolas birziska ( 1882–1962 ) , educator , vilnius university rector , co-author and signer of lithuania 's declaration of independence richard boleslawski ( 1889–1937 ) , director mary carr ( 1874–1973 ) , actress dolores costello ( 1903–1979 ) , actress helene costello ( 1906–1957 ) , actress lou costello ( 1906–1959 ) , actor and comedian mae costello ( 1882–1929 ) , actress maurice costello ( 1877–1950 ) , actor ysabel del valle ( 1837–1905 ) , rancho owner edward l . doheny ( 1856–1935 ) , oil tycoon jack dragna ( 1891–1956 ) , los angeles crime family boss william w . dixon ( 1838–1910 ) , u.s . representative ( democrat , fifty-second congress ) . later moved to rock creek cemetery , washington , d.c . irene dunne ( 1898–1990 ) , actress stepin fetchit ( 1902–1985 ) , comedian bryan foy ( 1896–1977 ) , film producer and director trixie friganza ( 1870–1955 ) , actress henry gage ( 1852–1924 ) , governor of california cedric gibbons ( 1893–1960 ) , prolific film art director and production designer elaine hammerstein ( 1897–1948 ) , actress ted healy ( 1896–1937 ) , actor/original leader of the three stooges john hodiak ( 1914–1955 ) , actor mervin king ( 1914–2008 ) , los angeles police department captain emilio kosterlitzky ( 1853–1928 ) , russian-born linguist and soldier of fortune leno la bianca ( 1925–1969 ) , murdered by the charles manson family timothy manning ( 1909–1989 ) , roman catholic cardinal , third archbishop of los angeles etta mcdaniel ( 1890–1946 ) , actress and sister of performers hattie mcdaniel & sam mcdaniel bull montana ( 1887–1950 ) , wrestler , actor zachariah montgomery ( 1825–1900 ) , assistant attorney general in first administration of president grover cleveland matt moore ( 1888–1960 ) , actor owen moore ( 1886–1939 ) , actor jelly roll morton ( 1885–1941 ) , musician j . carrol naish ( 1897–1973 ) , actor pola negri ( 1897–1987 ) , actress marguerite nichols ( 1891–1941 ) , actress mabel normand ( 1892–1930 ) , actress and comedian ramón novarro ( 1899–1968 ) , actor pauline o'neill ( 1865–1961 ) , wife of buckey o'neill of rough rider fame mary philbin ( 1903–1993 ) , actress ray prim ( 1909–1995 ) , baseball player jack reagan ( 1883–1941 ) , father of ronald reagan nelle wilson reagan ( 1883–1962 ) , mother of ronald reagan hugo reid ( 1811–1852 ) , prominent early l.a . county resident , originally interred in el campo santo cemetery hal roach , jr .
