Eugène Marin Labiche

early life . he was born into a bourgeois family and studied law . at the age of twenty , he contributed a short story to chérubin magazine , entitled '' les plus belles sont les plus fausses '' ( '' the most beautiful are the most fake/false '' ) . a few others followed , but failed to catch the attention of the public . career . labiche tried his hand at dramatic criticism in the revue des théâtres and in 1838 , wrote and premiered two plays . the small théâtre du pantheon produced , to some popular success , his drama l'avocat loubet , while a vaudeville , monsieur de coyllin , ou l'homme infiniment poli ( written in collaboration with marc-michel and performed at the palais royal ) introduced a provincial actor who was to become and to remain a great parisian favourite , the famous comedian grassot . , labiche 's publisher went bankrupt soon after the novel was out : '' a lucky misadventure , for this timely warning of destiny sent him back to the stage , where a career of success was awaiting him . '' there was yet another obstacle in the way . when he married , labiche solemnly promised his wife 's parents that he would renounce a profession then considered incompatible with moral regularity and domestic happiness . a year later , his wife released him from his vow , and labiche recalled the incident when he dedicated the first edition of his complete works to her . in conjunction with charles varin , marc-michel , louis françois clairville , dumanoir , and others , he contributed comic plays interspersed with couplets to various paris theatres . he was considered a successful but undistinguished vaudevillist , until he paired with marc-michel to create the five-act farce , un chapeau de paille d'italie ( the italian straw hat ) , which turned out to be a major success upon its opening in august 1851 . it is an accomplished specimen of the french imbroglio-style play , in which someone is in search of something , but does not find it till five minutes before the curtain falls . for the next twenty-five years , he continued to write successful comedies and vaudevilles , all basically constructed on the same plan and containing a dose of comic observation and good sense . '' of all the subjects , '' he said , '' which offered themselves to me , i have selected the bourgeois . essentially mediocre in his vices and in his virtues , he stands half-way between the hero and the scoundrel , between the saint and the profligate . '' during the second period of his career labiche collaborated with alfred delacour , adolphe choler , and others . emile augier said : '' the distinctive qualities which secured a lasting vogue for the plays of labiche are to be found in all the comedies written by him with different collaborators , and are conspicuously absent from those which they wrote without him . '' even more important was his professional relationship with actor jean marie geoffroy , who specialized in labiche 's pompous and fussy bourgeois characters . many of labiche 's roles were written specifically for geoffroy . célimare le bien-aimé ( 1863 ) , le voyage de m . perrichon ( 1860 ) , la grammaire , un pied dans le crime , la cagnotte ( 1864 ) , were some of labiche 's most important plays . retirement and death . in 1877 , he ended his connection with the stage , and retired to his rural property in sologne . there , he devoted his energies to supervising agricultural work and to reclaiming land and marshes . his lifelong friend , émile augier , visited him there , and strongly advised labiche to publish a collected and revised edition of his works . though labiche was initially reluctant , he issued , during 1878 and 1879 , his comic plays in ten volumes , which were enthusiastically received . many people had assumed that labiche 's plays owed their popularity to the actors who had appeared in them , but , upon reading the plays , they realized that their success was due to the writing itself , with its humor and skilled characterization . due to this re-evaluation of labiche 's writing , he was elected to the académie française in 1880 . labiche died in paris and was buried in the cimetière de montmartre . appreciation . some admirers have considered labiche the equal of molière ; his plays are more complex and less coarse than many other examples of french farce . love is practically absent from his theatre . in none of his plays did he ever venture into the depths of feminine psychology , and womankind is only represented by pretentious old maids and silly young ladies . he ridiculed marriage , but in a friendly and good-natured manner that always left a door open to repentance and timely amendment . plays . 1840 : deux papas très-bien , ou la grammaire de chicard 1844 : le major cravachon 1846 : frisette 1848 : le club champenois 1848 : un jeune homme pressé 1850 : embrassons-nous , folleville ! 1850 : la fille bien gardée 1850 : un garçon de chez véry 1851 : the italian straw hat ( un chapeau de paille d'italie ) 1852 : maman sabouleux 1852 : edgar et sa bonne 1852 : mon isménie ! 1852 : un monsieur qui prend la mouche 1852 : les suites d'un premier lit 1853 : la chasse aux corbeaux 1854 : les marquises de la fourchette 1855 : la perle de la canebière 1856 : si jamais je te pince . ! 1857 : l'affaire de la rue de lourcine 1857 : les noces de bouchencœur 1858 : l'avare en gants jaunes 1858 : un monsieur qui brûlé une dame 1858 : deux merles blancs 1858 : le clou aux maris 1859 : les petites mans 1859 : le baron de fourchevif 1860 : les deux timides 1860 : un gros mot 1860 : j'invite le colonel ! 1860 : la sensitive 1860 : le voyage de monsieur perrichon 1861 : 1861 : les vivacités du capitaine tic 1861 : j'ai compromis ma femme 1862 : les petits oiseaux 1862 : la station champbaudet 1862 : les 37 sous de monsieur montaudoiun 1862 : le première pas 1863 : la commode de victorine 1863 : célimar : le bien-aimé 1864 : la cagnotte 1864 : moi 1864 : un mari qui lance sa femme 1864 : le point de mire 1865 : le voyage en chine 1866 : un pied dans le crime 1867 : la grammaire 1867 : la main leste 1868 : le petit voyage 1869 : le choix d'un gendre ( un pochade en un acte ) 1870 : le plus heureux des trois 1872 : doit-on le dire ?
