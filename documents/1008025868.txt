Michael Rennie

early years and career . eric alexander rennie was born in idle near bradford , west riding of yorkshire , the second son of a scottish wool mill owner , james rennie , and his english wife amelia ( née dobby ) . he had an elder brother william , younger brother gordon and sister edith . rennie 's family owned a wool business which had operated for over 150 years and were relatively well off . he was educated at the leys school , cambridge . he went to work at the family wool mill in bradford , but did not enjoy it . he worked in a number of occupations , including a stint as a car salesman , and sweeping floors in his uncle 's steel ropes factory . he eventually decided ( at the time of his 26th birthday , in 1935 ) on a career as an actor . he retained his surname but adopted michael as his professional name . he cited ronald colman as his role model . . early british films . the 6 ' 4 '' tall rennie attracted the interest of a casting director at gaumont british who took him on as an extra . rennie said this was a deliberate strategy so he could learn how films were made . head of production michael balcon said rennie was taken on '' because he was good-looking and athletic . he knew nothing of acting , but was given a contract to play small parts and to work as stand-in for players such as robert young and john loder . '' rennie 's first screen acting was an uncredited bit part in the alfred hitchcock film secret agent ( 1936 ) , standing in for robert young . balcon says he saw rennie act in a scene in east meets west ( 1936 ) and fired him immediately afterwards . balcon wrote '' i had seen the rushes of that day 's filming and had at once decided that rennie was far too inexperienced to justify big screen parts . '' the 1937 screen test , which exists in the british film institute ( bfi ) archives under the title '' marguerite allan and michael rennie screen test '' , did not lead to a film career for either performer . balcon says rennie '' took his setback well , left the studios , and went off to learn his job in repertory . '' rennie worked mostly in yorkshire , eventually becoming a star with the york repertory company . among his roles were as professor henry higgins in pygmalion . he also played other bit parts and minor unbilled roles in other films , including the man who could work miracles ( 1936 ) , conquest of the air ( 1937 ) , the squeaker ( 1937 ) , gangway ( 1937 ) , the divorce of lady x ( 1938 ) , bank holiday ( 1938 ) , this man in paris ( 1939 ) and the briggs family ( 1940 ) . he later said he strove to perfect a '' mid-atlantic accent '' that could easily be understood by american as well as british audiences which resulted in people thinking he was canadian . . world war two . rising fame . shortly after the outbreak of war in europe on 3 september 1939 , rennie began to receive offers for larger film roles , including this man is dangerous ( 1940 ) , dangerous moonlight ( 1941 ) and pimpernel smith ( 1941 ) . rennie auditioned again for michael balcon , now head of ealing studios , and was cast in ships with wings . while that film was being prepared , rennie continued repertory work and accepted a one-line role in george formby 's turned out nice again . balcon says rennie '' declared that he enjoyed it as he was playing a motor salesman , and this reminded him of the days when he tried to sell cars – without securing a single buyer . '' rennie had his first big film role in the suspense drama tower of terror ( 1941 ) . this starred wilfrid lawson in the lead role as a crazed dutch lighthouse keeper in the netherlands in world war ii , while the second-billed rennie and third-billed movita had the romantic leads . in a 1951 interview rennie said this was his worst part . michael balcon also used him in the big blockade ( 1942 ) . he was called a '' rapidly rising newcomer '' . another profile referred to him as an '' athletic , gable-ish young man . '' . war service . rennie enlisted in the raf volunteer reserve on 27 may 1941 . '' there has been a pause in rennie 's film career '' , wrote balcon in 1942 . '' but there will be parts awaiting him when the war is over '' . he was officially discharged on 4 august 1942 , and then on the following day , he was commissioned '' for the emergency '' as pilot officer number 127347 on probation in the general duties branch of the rafvr . on 5 february 1943 , he was promoted to flying officer on probation . he resigned his commission on 1 may 1944 ( not discharged on disability , as the studio publicity stated ) . rennie had carried out his basic training near torquay in devon , after which he was sent to the united states for fighter plane training under the hap arnold . in this programme , pilots for the raf were trained by united states army air forces instructors . one of his fellow students was raf sgt jack morton , who told an anecdote about when he and rennie were in the same class : at the end of our primary course we were posted to a basic flying school at cochran field , macon , georgia . the class which completed the course at cochran field was now split up , half were posted to napier field , dothan , alabama , to train on single-engine planes , and the remainder were posted to twin-engine schools . like cochran , napier field was a large permanent air corps base and most of us were quite content to stay on the camp when we had time off . one of the cadets on our course had told us that he was a film actor , but no one took him seriously . we had to admit that he was right however when a film came to the camp cinema called ships with wings starring michael rennie . . film stardom . i 'll be your sweetheart and the wicked lady . with the end of the war in europe in may 1945 , rennie was given his first film break , when cast alongside margaret lockwood , then at the peak of her popularity , in the musical i 'll be your sweetheart ( 1945 ) , directed by val guest for gainsborough studios . rennie was billed below lockwood and vic oliver , given an '' introducing '' credit , but his character was the actual protagonist of the film . the movie was not a large hit but rennie received excellent notices , including a review from the us trade paper variety who said his performance made the film '' noteworthy '' and that he was '' likely hollywood material . the best bet in the way of a new male star to have come out of a british studio in many years . rennie not only has a lot on the ball as a straight lead , he knows the value of visual tricks . femmes will go for him in a big way . '' he followed this in another movie with lockwood at gainsborough , the sensual costume adventure the wicked lady ( both 1945 ) . rennie was the fifth lead , beneath lockwood , james mason , patricia roc and griffith jones . but it was a good part ( the one true love of lockwood 's character ) and an excellent project to be associated with – the year 's biggest box-office hit , subsequently being listed ninth on a list of top ten highest-grossing british films of all time . rennie 's prestige was also raised when he was given a single prominent scene as a commander of roman centurions in gabriel pascal 's production of george bernard shaw 's caesar and cleopatra ( also 1945 ) , starring vivien leigh and claude rains . the film 's expense caused it to lose a large amount of money , despite it being highly successful at the box office , particularly in the u.s . rennie was now established as a leading actor . one report called him '' the bobbysoxers ' dark idol . gainsborough 's 1945 discovery . '' he was mobbed by female fans on a personal appearance tour . gainsborough teamed him with one of their biggest female stars phyllis calvert in the melodrama the root of all evil ( 1947 ) . in july 1946 it was announced rennie had signed a five-year contract with maurice ostrer 's new company , premiere productions , worth £300,000 – making him the highest paid film star in britain . . maurice ostrer . rennie 's first film under the new contract was white cradle inn ( 1947 ) , shot in switzerland with madeleine carroll . rennie had been '' loaned out '' to another company to make it but then he made his first for ostrer at premiere , the idol of paris ( 1948 ) . the film did so badly that ostrer left the film industry . rennie made films for independent producers and his career momentum began to fade : uneasy terms ( 1948 ) ; golden madonna ( 1949 ) ( again with calvert ) ; and two comedies for val guest : miss pilgrim 's progress ( 1949 ) and the body said no ! ( 1950 ) . he had what may be considered rennie 's only role as one of two central characters in a fully-fledged love story in the 47-minute episode '' sanatorium '' , the longest of the somerset maugham tales constituting the omnibus film trio ( 1950 ) ; the 40-year-old rennie and the 20-year-old jean simmons play patients and doomed lovers in the title institution , which caters to victims of tuberculosis . hollywood career . 20th century fox . rennie was one of several english actors cast in the 20th century fox medieval adventure story the black rose ( 1950 ) , shot in england starring tyrone power and orson welles . rennie was specifically cast as the 13th-century king edward i , whose 6 ' 2 '' ( 1.88 m ) frame gave origin to his historical nickname '' longshanks '' . he was fifth-billed after cécile aubry and jack hawkins . rennie became good friends with power , who spoke well of the actor to fox executives . rennie 's performance impressed fox 's studio head , darryl f . zanuck , who offered him a role in a film shot in canada , the 13th letter ( 1951 ) . directed by otto preminger , it was a remake of the french film le corbeau ( the raven , 1943 ) , with the setting changed to the canadian province of quebec . fox was so pleased with rennie 's work that it offered him a seven-year contract in november 1950 . . the day the earth stood still . after claude rains turned down the role , rennie received top billing in his next film , the day the earth stood still ( also 1951 ) , the first postwar , large-budget , '' a '' science-fiction film . it was a serious , high-minded exploration of mid-20th century suspicion and paranoia , combined with a philosophical overview of humanity 's coming place in the larger universe . rennie said director robert wise told him to do the role '' with dignity but not with superiority '' . ( the story was later dramatised in 1954 on lux radio theatre , with rennie and billy gray recreating their original film roles . seven years later , on 3 march 1962 , when the day the earth stood still made its television premiere on nbc 's nbc saturday night at the movies , rennie appeared in a two-minute introductory prologue before the start of the film . ) rennie went on to support power in i 'll never forget you ( 1951 ) then had good roles in the ensemble drama phone call from a stranger ( 1952 ) ( where he played an american ) and in the wartime spy thriller , 5 fingers ( 1952 ) , as the agent who tracks down james mason 's spy . he did some narration for the desert fox : the story of rommel ( 1951 ) and would provide voice overs for several fox films , such as pony soldier ( 1952 ) , titanic ( 1953 ) , the desert rats ( 1953 ) , prince valiant ( 1954 ) . les misérables . buoyed by the strong critical reception and profitability of the day the earth stood still , fox assigned much of the credit to the central performance of rennie . convinced that it had a potential leading man under contract , the studio decided to produce a new version of les misérables ( 1952 ) as a vehicle for him . the film was directed by lewis milestone , known for his early sound version of all quiet on the western front . rennie 's performance was respectfully , but not enthusiastically , received by the critics . ultimately , les misérables returned an extremely modest profit and put an end to any further attempts to promote the 43-year-old rennie as a potential star . this caused the studio to cancel a project he was attached to in 1952 — arms of venus . he was , however , launched on a thriving career as a top supporting actor at fox , often playing figures of authority , such as military officers or doctors . supporting actor at fox . rennie was second-billed in sailor of the king ( also known as single-handed , 1953 ) , as an admiral , but it was very much in support of jeffrey hunter . he was leading man to jeanne crain in a thriller , dangerous crossing ( 1953 ) , which re-used sets and props from titanic ( also 1953 ) for which rennie spoke the closing narration . he had a showy role as saint peter in the robe ( 1953 ) , the first movie in cinemascope and the biggest hit of the year . the star was richard burton , who had essentially taken rennie 's place on the fox lot as their '' resident british star '' . rennie supported power once more in king of the khyber rifles ( 1954 ) , as a brigadier in british india , then played his first villain for fox , an evil khan in the '' eastern '' , princess of the nile ( 1954 ) , opposite jeffrey hunter . he reprised his role as peter in demetrius and the gladiators ( 1954 ) and was lent out for mambo ( 1954 ) . in désirée ( 1954 ) , rennie played the future charles xiv john of sweden opposite marlon brando as napoleon bonaparte . the film was popular though is not as highly regarded as other brando films from this time . soldier of fortune ( 1955 ) , was another hit , with rennie as the head of british police in hong kong supporting clark gable and susan hayward . on tv he played the attorney in an adaptation of the letter ( 1955 ) with john mills . he also received good reviews for his performance as an art dealer in '' a man of taste '' ( 1955 ) for climax with zsa zsa gabor . rennie enjoyed live tv . '' you have greater performances as opposed to those in a filmed series '' , he said . '' you are able to build and sustain a role in live tv whereas you have the problem of cutting , stopping and starting in a filmed show . '' based on the positive reaction to his two turns as the apostle peter , fox assigned him another third-billed , top-tier role as a stalwart man of god , franciscan friar junípero serra , who , between 1749 and his death in 1784 , founded missions in alta california . the film was seven cities of gold ( 1955 ) , with richard egan and anthony quinn . his next film was the rains of ranchipur ( 1955 ) , assigned him fifth billing after the lead romantic teaming of lana turner and richard burton . as turner 's character 's cuckolded husband , lord esketh , rennie maintained his typical dignity and stiff upper lip . he supported ginger rogers in teenage rebel ( 1956 ) and had a good role as the man murdered by james mason in island in the sun ( 1957 ) , darryl zanuck 's popular melodrama . his contract with fox then wound up . post-20th century-fox . rennie began his freelancing career supporting cornel wilde in omar khayyam ( 1957 ) at paramount . he returned to britain to play the lead in a war film battle of the v-1 ( 1958 ) . he was going to co-produce and star in a war film for eros films about bomb disposal experts . getaway , but it was not made . scheduling conflicts meant he missed out on a role in the vikings ( 1958 ) , being replaced by james donald . he had top billing in a mountaineering film for disney , third man on the mountain ( 1959 ) , although he was really the support for james macarthur . irwin allen gave him a leading part at fox , casting him as adventurer lord john roxton in an adaptation of sir arthur conan doyle 's the lost world ( 1960 ) , a tale of a jungle expedition that finds prehistoric monsters in south america ; the film also starred claude rains , jill st . john and richard haydn . no longer bound by the no-television clause in his studio contract , he began his association with the medium . the third man and mary mary . rennie became a familiar face on television , taking the role of harry lime in the third man ( 1959–65 ) , an anglo-american syndicated television series very loosely derived from the film . it ran for several years but the schedule meant rennie had plenty of time off to work on other projects . '' every scene of every show i do for money '' , he said . at the start of the 1960s , michael rennie made his only broadway appearance in mary , mary playing dirk winsten , a jaded film star . after two previews , the sophisticated five-character marital comedy written by jean kerr and directed by joseph anthony opened at the helen hayes theatre on 8 march 1961 . it ran for a very successful 1,572 performances , closing at the morosco theatre on 12 december 1964 . rennie stayed with the production less than five months and was replaced by michael wilding in july 1961 . when warner bros . cast the film version in early 1963 , rennie , along with leading man barry nelson and supporting actor hiram sherman ( who joined the play two years after the opening in the part first played by john cromwell ) were the only broadway cast members to carry over . debbie reynolds was given the title role created by barbara bel geddes , and warner 's contract player diane mcbain , whom the studio saw as a potential star of the future , took over '' the socialite part '' essayed by betsy von furstenberg . mervyn leroy produced and directed the film , which opened at radio city music hall on 25 october 1963 . later career . during the 1960s , rennie made guest appearances on such series as the barbara stanwyck show , the americans , route 66 ( a portrayal of a doomed pilot in the two-part episode '' fly away home '' ) ; alfred hitchcock presents ; perry mason ( one of four actors in four consecutive episodes substituting for series star raymond burr , who was recovering from surgery ) ; wagon train ( a 90-minute colour episode as an english big game hunter ) ; the great adventure ( in an instalment of this anthology series about remarkable events in american history , he portrayed confederate president jefferson davis ) ; daniel boone , ( in the episodes '' the sound of wings '' and '' first in war , first in peace '' ) ; lost in space ( another two-part episode—as an all-powerful alien zookeeper , '' the keeper '' , he worked one last time with his third man co-star jonathan harris ) ; the time tunnel ( as captain smith of the titanic , in the series ' premiere episode ) ; batman ( as the villainous sandman , in league with julie newmar 's catwoman ) ; three episodes of the invaders ( as a benign variation of the klaatu persona , culminating in a parallel plot also involving an assembly of world leaders ) ; an episode of i spy ( '' lana '' ) ; and two episodes of the f.b.i . ; and was a thrush agent in an episode of the man from u.n.c.l.e . ( 1967 tv series ) ( '' the thrush roulette affair '' /barnaby partridge ) . also branded . final films . rennie 's later films included ride beyond vengeance ( 1966 ) , cyborg 2087 ( 1967 ) , the all-star hotel ( 1967 ) , death on the run ( 1968 ) , and the young , the evil and the savage ( 1968 ) . he completed what amounted to guest roles in two films , the power and the devil 's brigade ( both 1968 ) , before moving to switzerland in the latter part of that year . his final seven feature films were filmed in britain , italy , spain and , in the case of surabaya conspiracy , the philippines . personal life . rennie was married twice : first to joan england ( 1912–1974 ) ( 1938–1945 ) , then to actress margaret ( maggie ) mcgrath ( 1919–2017 ) ( 1947–1960 ) ; their son , david rennie , is an english circuit judge in lewes , sussex , england . both marriages ended in divorce . when divorcing his second wife , she fainted on the stand during cross-examination . rennie revealed he had been separated from her since november 1953 . ( her mother had been murdered in 1954 . ) he had a son , john marshall ( born 1944 ) , with his longtime friend and mistress , renée ( née gilbert ) , whose later married name was taylor . renée was the sister of the british film director lewis gilbert . during the war years , they lived coincidentally in flats in the white house in albany street near regent 's park in london ( now a hotel ) . the white house was a favourite location to live during the war years . it was built in the shape of a white cross and was such a good navigation mark for the luftwaffe , that it was rumoured that there were standing orders to avoid bombing it – hence its popularity with celebrities and the wealthy . although michael offered to accept paternity on discovering the news of her pregnancy , renée refused , as she was unwilling to jeopardise his growing success as a romantic lead in major feature films . however , rennie kept a watchful eye on john marshall over the years , even after his marriage to maggie mcgrath , and both families remained in constant touch until rennie 's death . in fact renée and maggie lived for many years in the 1970s and 1980s within 200 yards of each other in barnes and were close friends . both michael rennie and his sister bunny were very fond of renée 's family . coincidentally the british film institute 's database lists rennie as also having a son , john m . taylor , who is described as '' a producer . '' john marshall rennie used the pseudonym '' taylor '' during his long career in the industry to avoid accusations of nepotism . michael rennie was also briefly engaged to mary gardner , the ex-wife of hollywood director otto preminger . in 1959 , preminger was divorcing mary and claimed rennie was having an affair with her . in 1958 , rennie said he earned 117,000 a year which provided him with 36,000 net . . death . less than three years after leaving hollywood , he journeyed to his mother 's home in harrogate , yorkshire , following the death of his brother . it was there that he died suddenly of an aortic aneurysm almost two months before his 62nd birthday . after his cremation , his ashes were interred in harlow hill cemetery , harrogate . . complete filmography . secret agent ( 1936 ) as army captain ( uncredited ) the man who could work miracles ( 1936 ) as san francisco cop ( uncredited ) conquest of the air ( 1936 ) ( uncredited ) gypsy ( 1937 ) ( uncredited ) gangway ( 1937 ) as ship 's officer ( uncredited ) the squeaker ( 1937 ) as medical examiner ( uncredited ) the divorce of lady x ( 1938 ) as minor role ( uncredited ) bank holiday ( 1938 ) as guardsman ( uncredited ) this man in paris ( 1949 ) ( uncredited ) the briggs family ( 1940 ) as plainclothes policeman ( uncredited ) this man is dangerous ( 1941 ) as inspector turned out nice again ( 1941 ) as diner ( uncredited ) dangerous moonlight ( 1941 ) as kapulski '' pimpernel '' smith ( 1941 ) as prison camp officer ( uncredited ) tower of terror ( 1941 ) as anthony hale ships with wings ( 1942 ) as lieut . maxwell the big blockade ( 1942 ) as royal air force : george the sky 's the limit ( 1943 , short ) as george i 'll be your sweetheart ( 1945 ) as bob fielding the wicked lady ( 1945 ) as kit locksby caesar and cleopatra ( 1945 ) as 1st centurion the root of all evil ( 1947 ) as charles mortimer white cradle inn ( 1947 ) as rudolph morning departure ( 1948 , tv movie ) as lt.-cmdr . stanford the idol of paris ( 1948 ) as hertz uneasy terms ( 1948 ) as slim callaghan the golden madonna ( 1949 ) as mike christie miss pilgrim 's progress ( 1950 ) as bob thane trio ( 1950 ) as major templeton ( segment '' sanatorium '' ) the black rose ( 1950 ) as king edward the body said no !
