AM General

corporate history . am general traces its roots to the standard wheel company of terre haute , indiana , which expanded in 1903 to include the overland automobile division . in 1908 , john north willys purchased the overland company , then based in indianapolis , indiana , and renamed it willys-overland motors . in the 1940s , it developed a vehicle to us army specifications and later mass-produced '' america 's first four-wheel drive one-fourth-ton tactical utility truck '' —the jeep of world war ii fame . in 1953 , kaiser motors purchased willys-overland , changing its name to first to kaiser-willys motor company and kaiser-jeep corporation in 1963 . in 1970 it was purchased by american motors corporation . in july 2020 , kps capital partners acquired the company . . defense and government products division . in 1964 , kaiser-jeep purchased the studebaker facilities in south bend , indiana , which included studebaker 's '' general products division '' , along with its substantial defense contracts . at the time , kaiser had been awarded a us 87 million army truck contract , and under government pressure agreed to perform the work at the south bend plant it had recently acquired from studebaker . american motors . american motors ( amc ) purchased the jeep corporation from kaiser in 1970 when it decided to leave the auto business . in 1971 , amc made the general products division of jeep ( producing military trucks as well as contract and non-commercial vehicles ) a wholly owned subsidiary and renamed it am general corporation . american motors ceased to function as an independent automaker in 1982 when a controlling interest was purchased by renault . us government regulations at that time forbade ownership of defense contractors by foreign governments—and renault was partially owned by the french government . . ltv corporation . in 1983 , ltv corporation bought am general and established it as a wholly owned subsidiary . in 1984 , its headquarters moved from the american motors amtek building in detroit , michigan , to livonia , michigan , and two years later to south bend , indiana , where primary manufacturing operations were located . renco group . in 1992 , am general was sold to renco group , which in 2002 converted it to a limited liability company . hummer brand . in 1992 am general began marketing the hmmwv to the civilian market under the hummer brand . in 1999 gm acquired the rights to the brand and continued production of the original civilian hummer as the h1 until june 2006 . am general built a separate factory for the new hummer h2 , designed by and marketed by gm . the vehicle went on the market in 2002 and was produced until january 2009 . am general did not build the h3 model . gm was sued early in 2003 by daimlerchrysler , owners of the jeep brand , for the resemblance of the hummer 's seven-slot grille to jeep's . the lawsuit was dismissed after acknowledgment of the shared corporate history of amc and jeep . . 2004 - present . on august 20 , 2004 , it was announced that ronald perelman 's macandrews & forbes company would form a joint venture with am general 's then-owner , renco group , to give perelman 70 % ownership . the deal reportedly cost close to us 1 billion . in 2008 , am general and the mv-1 ( vpg ) , of troy , michigan , announced that contracts had been signed for am general to begin producing purpose-built taxi-cabs in 2009 . actual production would not begin until october 2011 . the first vehicle off the line was presented to marc buoniconti , a former linebacker for the citadel who was partially paralyzed in 1985 . in may 2010 , azure dynamics announced it had chosen am general to assemble its electric drivetrain for ford transit connect vehicles for the north american market at its livonia , michigan , factory . in september 2013 , am general reached an agreement to purchase the united states department of energy 's secured loan to the vehicle production group ( vpg ) . prior to this , am general acted as sole vehicle assembler for vpg . as a result of this transaction , am general created a wholly owned company , mobility ventures llc , to operate the mobility vehicle-1 ( mv-1 ) business and receive all vpg assets . in 2015 , production of the mercedes-benz r-class began at the mishawaka assembly plant . without this deal , '' the german automaker would likely have had to shut down production of the vehicle , currently only sold in china . '' production ended in october 2017 . jeep dispatcher 100 . another familiar product from the am general line was the jeep dj-5 series—a purpose built '' dispatch jeep '' 2-wheel drive ( rwd ) version of the jeep cj-5—used in huge numbers as a right-hand drive mail delivery vehicle by the united states postal service . buses . the am general metropolitan buses were manufactured for city transit use from 1974 until 1979 , producing a total of 5,431 buses ( including 219 trolleybuses ) . the metropolitan was built under a 1971 agreement with flyer industries of winnipeg , manitoba ; am general licensed the rights to build and market the western flyer d700 for the us market . the d700 itself was similar in design to the contemporaneous gm new look buses . the front end of the d700 was restyled and thus the resulting metropolitan was not simply a flyer design built under license but rather a jointly designed vehicle . flyer later adopted the design changes for its own line as the models d800 and e800 . buses were built in lengths of either or , and widths of or . the model numbers reflected the chosen dimensions ; for example , model '' 10240 '' indicated a 102-inch wide , 40-foot long bus . suffixes '' a '' or '' b '' were used for later models to indicate certain options . in total , 3,571 40-foot diesel buses and 1,641 35-foot diesel buses were produced . . articulated buses . in 1977–1979 , am general also worked under a partnership with man of germany to build sg 220 articulated buses for us transit systems . man fabricated the bodyshells in germany and shipped them to the us for am general for final assembly . two different lengths were offered , and ; 93 buses were built to the shorter length while the rest were 60 & nbsp ; feet long . by october 1978 , the company discontinued bus production with the last unit completed in march 1979 . the total number built was just under 400 ( 392 or 399 ) , the largest group by far being 150 for seattle 's metro transit . man subsequently set up its own factory for us production in cleveland , north carolina . . trolleybuses . production of complete motor buses ( and of any two-axle motor buses ) had ended in 1978 and aside from the fitting-out of the last articulated man shells , the only production in 1979 was two batches of trolleybuses ( and the only such vehicles ever built by the company ) . these were all vehicles , model 10240t : 110 trackless trolleys for the trolleybuses in philadelphia , operated by septa ; and 109 for the trolleybuses in seattle , operated by metro transit ( now king county metro ) . one of the latter has been preserved since its retirement in 2003 by king county metro ( see king county metro fleet ) . development and production of the hmmwv . in 1979 , am general began preliminary design work on the humvee ( hmmwv , pronounced humvee ) , a 1.25-ton truck intended to replace the m151 and other light utility vehicles . the us army awarded am general a prototype contract in 1981 with development and operational testing conducted over a five-month period in 1982 . in march 1983 , am general won an initial 1.2 billion contract to produce 55,000 humvees to be delivered in five basic models and 15 different configurations over a five-year period . production began at the mishawaka , indiana , assembly plant in the fall of 1984 and the first deliveries were made in early 1985 . total international production by mid-1991 was more than 72,000 . since 1991 , an additional 20,000 hmmwvs ordered brought total international production to 100,000 in march 1995 . late in 2000 , am general was awarded another contract for 2,962 m998a2 series trucks . the contract contained six single-year options running to fiscal year 2007 and continues to be renewed . to date , nearly 250,000 units have been produced . humvees feature full-time four-wheel drive , an independent suspension , steep approach and departure angles , 60-percent grade ability and of ground clearance . more recent production models include the m1151 , m1152 , m1165 , and m1167 . as of 2015 , humvees are in use by the us army , marine corps , air force , and navy . the combined fleet numbers 140,000 . more than 50 nations have bought these vehicles , too . the humvee 's replacement , a completely new joint light tactical vehicle ( jltv ) design , has been in production by oshkosh corporation since 2016 . am general was unsuccessful in its bid for this 30-billion 25-year contract , leading to fears that the company might not remain independent , but it is now focused on military humvee support ( they still outnumber jltvs by three to one ) and development of a new ambulance model . joint light tactical vehicle award shakes up industry - nationaldefensemagazine.org , october 2015 . other military vehicles . am general also acquired department of defense contracts for medium and heavy trucks , including the m151a2 , m151 truck , utility , l/4-ton , 4×4 m35 series , and a heavier m939 truck . in 2005 , am general was contracted to take over militarization , sales , and marketing of lssv vehicles .
