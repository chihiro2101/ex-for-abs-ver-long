Vasily Alekseyev

biography . at the age of 18 , alekseyev began practicing weightlifting at trud vss , trained by his coach rudolf plyukfelder until 1968 , when he began to train solo . he was not a naturally large man like other super heavyweights but was encouraged to gain strength by adding weight . in january 1970 alekseyev set his first world record , and during the world weightlifting championship in columbus , ohio , us . in 1970 he was the first man to clean and jerk 500 pounds ( 227 & nbsp ; kg ) in competition . during one of his early world records , oscar state obe remarked that the weight of over 460 pounds ( 209 & nbsp ; kg ) in the olympic press looked so easy it could have been a broomstick . this was the beginning of a series of 80 world records alekseyev set between 1970 and 1977 . he received bonus funds every time he set a world record by the soviet government ( soviet athletes were funded by the state ) ; so he made it a point to gradually increase his world records by 1.1 pounds or 0.5 & nbsp ; kg . he was unbeaten and held the world championship and european championship titles for those eight years . he was the first man to total over 600 & nbsp ; kg in the triple event . many thought he would be the first to clean and jerk the mythical 600 pounds but it was never to be as his habit of increasing world records by only 1/2 kilo took so long that age caught up to him . alekseyev 's performance in the moscow olympics of 1980 was a disappointment . he had by then become more of a recluse , training by himself without a coach . in the snatch he set his opening weight too high and was unable to lift it , scoring zero kilograms as the result . he retired from weightlifting after the moscow olympics . in 1987 , alekseyev was elected to represent the ryazan oblast for the soviet union 's congress of people 's deputies . alekseyev worked as a coach between 1990 and 1992 . under his leadership , the unified team earned ten medals in weightlifting at the 1992 summer olympics , including five golds . from 1966 alekseyev lived in shakhty , where in 1971 he graduated from the branch of the novocherkassk polytechnical institute . he died on 25 november 2011 in germany in a clinic where he had been sent for serious heart problems . he was 69 . the russian weightlifting federation reported his death and called him a '' soviet sports legend '' and '' one of the strongest people in the world '' . original russian text : '' легендой советского спорта '' and '' один из сильнейших людей планеты '' . he was survived by wife olimpiada and sons sergey and dmitry . dmitry competed nationally in weightlifting , placing fourth at the 1988 soviet weightlifting championships . . legacy and awards . vladimir vysotsky devoted his '' song about weightlifter '' , 1971 ) to alekseyev . alekseyev was featured on the cover of sports illustrated 14 april 1975 , titled '' world 's strongest man .
