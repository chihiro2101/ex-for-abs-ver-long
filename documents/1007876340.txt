Teófilo Stevenson

early years . stevenson was born in puerto padre , cuba . . periodico . his father , teófilo stevenson patterson , was an immigrant from saint vincent . his mother dolores lawrence was a native cuban , but her parents were immigrants from the anglophone island of saint kitts . teófilo senior arrived in cuba in 1923 , finding work wherever he could , before settling in camagüey with dolores , where he gave english lessons to top up his meagre earnings . due to his large size , teófilo senior was encouraged into boxing by local trainers , fighting seven times before becoming disillusioned by the corrupt payment structure on offer to young fighters . in the red corner . john duncan . pp . 77–79 . teófilo junior was a shiftless but bright child who at nine years old soon found himself sparring at the makeshift open-air gym his father had frequented . under the tutelage of former national light heavyweight champion john herrera , teófilo junior began his career fighting far more experienced boxers , but according to herrera , '' had what it took '' . despite his growing involvement in the sport , stevenson had yet to tell his mother about his activities . eventually teófilo sr . broke the news to his wife , who was furious ; but she agreed to acquiesce on the provision that the boy was accompanied by his father . . boxing career . beginnings . the young stevenson continued to improve under herrera in the mid 1960s , winning a junior title and gaining additional training in havana . his victories drew the attention of andrei chervonenko , a head coach in cuba 's newly implemented state sports system . professional sports throughout the island had been outlawed since 1962 by government resolution 83-a , and all boxing activity had come under the guidance of the government sponsored national boxing commission . cubans flex muscles in world of controversy / independent news – cuba news / noticias – cubanet news chervonenko , a retired boxer himself , sent by the soviet union , who had created cuba 's escuela de boxeo ( boxing school ) in a derelict old gym in havana , began to champion stevenson 's progress . duncan , p.79 stevenson 's senior boxing career began at age seventeen with a defeat in the national championships against the experienced heavyweight gabriel garcia . despite the setback , stevenson went on to register convincing victories over nancio carrillo and juan perez , two of cuba 's finest boxers in the weight division , securing a place in the national team for the 1970 central american and caribbean boxing championships . defeat in the final after three victories was considered no shame , and stevenson firmly established himself as cuba 's premier heavyweight . back in the gym chervonenko and leading cuban boxing coach alcides sagarra worked on stevenson 's jab , which became his ultimate weapon , and paid dividends when the cuban easily defeated east germany 's bernd anders in front of a surprised berlin crowd . the victory made the entire amateur boxing world take notice of stevenson as a serious heavyweight contender . duncan , p-80-81 . munich olympics 1972 . stevenson , now twenty , joined the cuban boxing team for the 1972 summer olympics . his opening bout against experienced polish fighter ludwik denderys began dramatically when stevenson knocked the other man down within thirty seconds of the opening bell . the fight was stopped moments later due to a large cut next to the pole 's eye . proceeding to the quarter finals , stevenson met american boxer duane bobick . bobick , a gold medalist at the 1971 pan american games , had beaten stevenson previously . after a close first round , stevenson lost the second , but a ferocious display in the third round knocked bobick to the canvas three times and the contest was stopped . the victory was viewed on television throughout cuba , and is still considered stevenson 's most memorable performance . stevenson easily defeated german peter hussing in the semifinal by tko in the 2nd round , and received his gold medal after romanian ion alexe failed to appear in the final due to injury . the cuban boxing team won three gold medals , their first in olympic boxing history , as well as one silver and one bronze . the munich games established cuba 's dominance over the amateur sport that was to last decades . it also established stevenson as the world 's premier amateur heavyweight boxer . less than two years after his successful performance at the munich olympics , stevenson , then 22-year-old , was rewarded with a house for himself in havana and another for himself and his family in delicias . stevenson later recalled : '' i had no idea the house in delicias was going to be so big . when i was shown the plans , i said , 'what is this ? a bunker ? ’ '' aiba president anwar chowdhry , when asked did the cuban authorities acted properly in giving stevenson two houses and two cars , said : '' these things should not be allowed . if gifts are to be given it should be for everybody—not for a few . '' over tea in his office in havana 's sports city coliseum , inder president conrado martínez corona defended the local practice of giving cars and apartments to top athletes . '' our country has the obligation of solving the problems of all citizens—the problems of their nourishment , housing , education and health , '' he said . '' it 's a pity we ca n't solve this problem in the way we need to for everybody . '' . prime years . stevenson did the same at the inaugural 1974 world championships in havana , cuba , and then in the 1976 summer olympics , held in montreal , stevenson repeated the feat once again . by then , he had become a national hero in cuba . this was the point where he was the closest to signing a professional contract , as american fight promoters offered him us 5 million to challenge world heavyweight champion muhammad ali . if he had accepted , it would have made stevenson the second boxer to go straight from the olympics into a professional debut with the world 's heavyweight crown on the line , after pete rademacher . stevenson refused the offer , however , asking '' what is one million dollars compared to the love of eight million cubans ? '' stevenson went to the 1980 summer olympics in moscow and became the second boxer ever , after papp , to win three olympic boxing gold medals . stevenson participated at the 1982 world amateur boxing championships in munich , but lost to the eventual silver medalist and future professional world champion francesco damiani from italy . this fight ended an eleven-year unbeaten run by stevenson and was the only occasion that he did not win the gold medal at the world championships when he entered the competition . his loss by a split decision to aleksandr lukstin of the soviet union in the finals of the 1983 córdova cardín , as the soviet head coach kontsantin koptsev later admitted , was due to a plaster-like tape they hand wrap lukstin 's fists instead of a regular elastic-band hand wrapping . территория бокса - андрей курнявка и константин копцев ( выпуск 28 ) ( in russian ) stevenson might have won a fourth gold medal at the 1984 summer olympics , but the soviet union boycotted the games , which were hosted by los angeles , in retaliation for the american boycott of the 1980 moscow competition . cuba followed the soviet lead , and stevenson did not compete . for consolation , he beat future olympic champion tyrell biggs in february 1984 ( breaking three ribs in a process ) and won the super heavyweight gold at the 1984 friendship games , defeating ulli kaden of east germany and , in the final , valeriy abadzhyan of the soviet union . at the 1986 world amateur boxing championships , he won the super heavyweight gold , defeating alex garcia from the united states in the final . stevenson retired from boxing shortly after the 1988 summer olympics , which cuba also boycotted . . rivalry with vysotsky . teófilo stevenson was known for two fights with soviet boxer igor vysotsky , who defeated stevenson twice . vysotsky later revealed in his interview to east side boxing : vysotsky was the only boxer out of hundreds of stevenson 's opponents to ever stop him , let alone by knockout , and to defeat him twice , both times in his prime , without being avenged . and on top of it , vysotsky scored his first victory over stevenson at the córdova cardín , cubans ' home tournament , where they do their best to never let any foreigner get into the finals . stevenson 's second loss to vysotsky happened six weeks before his knockout winning streak at the 1976 olympics in montreal , which ended up with a victories over john tate and mircea șimon . after losing to vysotsky for a second time he said , '' nobody is invincible .

'' we plan to use this money for social problems , '' an inder official said at the time . but the u.s . treasury department did not allow the series , saying that it violated terms of the u.s . embargo against cuba . apart from that attempt , arum used a jamaican promoter , lucien chen , as a mediator , to propose a 1 million fight against leon spinks . '' i envisioned a fight that would be attended by the two presidents , fidel castro and jimmy carter , '' chen said . nevertheless , stevenson 's professional debut never did happen , because he remained loyal to the cuban revolutionary ideals , never accepting any payday for himself , no matter how big it appeared . after knocking out three opponents at the munich olympics in september 1972 , including duane bobick of the united states , stevenson was approached by an american promoter , who offered him 1 million to turn pro on the spot . '' i will not trade the cuban people for all the dollars in the world , '' stevenson was heard to say . '' stevenson would have been phenomenal as a pro , he could have been in the same class as muhammad ali or joe frazier . but we 'll never know , '' said don king . . retirement and later years . stevenson finished his sports career in 1988 . he started to work as a boxing trainer and sports functionary . he worked at the national institute for sports , physical education , and recreation ( inder , ) also he served as vice president of the cuban boxing federation . in 1999 , stevenson was arrested for an altercation incident at miami international airport where , before boarding a united airlines chartered jet of the cuban national boxing team , he allegedly headbutted a 41-year-old united airlines ticket counter employee , knocking him off several teeth in the process . according to stevenson , an '' agitator '' approached him at the airport shouting insults against the cuban government and other things , which are sensitive to any cuban . stevenson failed to attend the subsequent court proceedings , having travelled to havana after his release from custody while on bail . the cuban state newspaper trabajadores blamed what it described as the '' miami mafia '' ( i.e . cuban exiles , whose vast diaspora reside in florida ) for provoking the incident , alleging that the cuban american national foundation organised a public gathering to abuse stevenson when he returned to miami airport after his arrest . the newspaper believed that the motives for the alleged provocation were somehow to cast a shadow upon a cuban sports star . accused cuban boxer provoked by insults to castro reuters news . death . stevenson died on 11 june 2012 of a heart attack in havana at the age of 60 . it was first reported by cuban state media , stating that '' the cuban sporting family was moved today by the passing of one of the greatest of all time '' . it had been reported earlier by an anonymous sports official that stevenson had suffered a heart attack . he is survived by his two children . a forthcoming documentary by brin-jonathan butler , split decision , contains the last known interview with stevenson . awards and honours . stevenson was awarded the val barker trophy for outstanding boxer at the 1972 olympic games . in 1972 , stevenson became a merited master of sport of the ussr , one of a few foreign athletes to be awarded the title in its history .
