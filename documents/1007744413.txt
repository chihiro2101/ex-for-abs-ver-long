Science Museum, London

origin and history . the museum was founded in 1857 under bennet woodcroft from the collection of the royal society of arts and surplus items from the great exhibition as part of the south kensington museum , together with what is now the victoria and albert museum . it included a collection of machinery which became the museum of patents in 1858 , and the patent office museum in 1863 . this collection contained many of the most famous exhibits of what is now the science museum . in 1883 , the contents of the patent office museum were transferred to the south kensington museum . in 1885 , the science collections were renamed the science museum and in 1893 a separate director was appointed . the art collections were renamed the art museum , which eventually became the victoria and albert museum . when queen victoria laid the foundation stone for the new building for the art museum , she stipulated that the museum be renamed after herself and her late husband . this was initially applied to the whole museum , but when that new building finally opened ten years later , the title was confined to the art collections and the science collections had to be divorced from it . on 26 june 1909 the science museum , as an independent entity , came into existence . the science museum 's present quarters , designed by sir richard allison , were opened to the public in stages over the period 1919–28 . this building was known as the east block , construction of which began in 1913 and temporarily halted by world war i . as the name suggests it was intended to be the first building of a much larger project , which was never realized . however , the museum buildings were expanded over the following years ; a pioneering children 's gallery with interactive exhibits opened in 1931 , the centre block was completed in 1961-3 , the infill of the east block and the construction of the lower & upper wellcome galleries in 1980 , and the construction of the wellcome wing in 2000 result in the museum now extending to queen 's gate . collections . wing which focuses on digital technology . entrance has been free since 1 december 2001 . library . the science museum has a dedicated library , and until the 1960s was britain 's national library for science , medicine and technology . it holds runs of periodicals , early books and manuscripts , and is used by scholars worldwide . it was , for a number of years , run in conjunction with the central library of imperial college , but in 2007 the library was divided over two sites . histories of science and biographies of scientists were kept at the imperial college library until february 2014 when the arrangement was terminated , the shelves were cleared and the books and journals shipped out , joining the rest of the collection , which includes original scientific works and archives , at the science museum at wroughton , wiltshire . the imperial college library catalogue search system now informs searchers that volumes formerly held there are '' available at science museum library swindon currently unavailable '' . a new research centre with library facilities is promised for late 2015 but is unlikely to have book stacks nearby . storage and archives . between 1979 and 2019 , the museum 's main storage and archive facility was at blythe house . 170,000 items which are not on current display are stored at the science museum at wroughton , a 220-hectare ( 545-acre ) former raf base near swindon owned by the museum since 1979 . the science museum will use £40m from the government to develop the wroughton site and put many previously stored items on display there from 2023 , in addition to storage , conservation labs , and research facilities . . the dana library and research centre . in november 2003 , the science museum opened the dana centre . the centre is an urban bar and café annexed to the museum . it was designed by mjp architects . in october 2007 , the science museum cancelled a talk by the co-discoverer of the structure of dna , james d . watson , because he claimed that iq test results showed black people to have lower intelligence than white people . the decision was criticised by some scientists , including richard dawkins , but supported by other scientists , including steven rose . . informal learning . around 450,000 young people visit the science museum on educational trips or benefit from its outreach programmes each year , more than any other uk museum . . astronights . the science museum also organises '' astronights '' , '' all-night extravaganza with a scientific twist '' . up to 380 children aged between 8 and 11 , accompanied by adults , are invited to spend an evening performing fun '' science based '' activities and then spend the night sleeping in the museum galleries amongst the exhibits . in the morning , they 're woken to breakfast and more science , watching a show before the end of the event . . lates . on the evening of the last wednesday of every month ( except december ) the museum organises an adults only evening with up to 30 events , from lectures to silent discos . previous lates have seen conversations with the actress activist lily cole and biorevolutions with the francis crick institute which attracted around 7000 people , mostly under the age of 35 . . galleries . the science museum is made up of a number of galleries , some of which are permanent , and some of which are temporary . the energy hall . the east hall is the first area that most visitors see as they enter the
