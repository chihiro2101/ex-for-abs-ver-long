Merrimack River

etymology and spelling . the etymology of the name of the merrimack river - from which all subsequent uses derive , such as the name of the civil war ironclad - remains uncertain . there is some evidence that it is native american . in 1604 the natives of later new england told pierre dugua , sieur de monts , who was leading a colony of french language speakers to acadia ( later nova scotia ) , of a beautiful river to the south . the french promptly pronounced its native name as merremack . in 1605 samuel de champlain followed this lead , found the river and renamed it riviere du gas . the french and their name did not remain on the merrimack . the natives dwelling along the river at that time were the agawam on the lower reaches , the pawtucket at lowell , massachusetts , the nashua , souhegan and namoskeag around manchester , new hampshire , the pennacook northward from bow , new hampshire , and the winnepisseogee at the source , lake winnipesaukee . these were all members of a nation of algonquian speakers known as the nipmuck , meaning '' still water place '' . meade 170 according to joseph b . walker , pages 414-415 . relying on chandler eastman potter 's the history of manchester ( 1856 ) , merremack contains the elements merruh ( '' strong '' ) and auke ( '' place '' â€”a recognizable locative ending ) , and means '' the place of strong current , - a term not inappropriate , when we consider . the river 's rapids .
