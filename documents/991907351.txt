Economic geography

theoretical background and influences . there are varied methodological approaches . neoclassical location theory , following in the tradition of alfred weber , tend to focus on industrial location and use quantitative methods . since the 1970s , two broad reactions against neoclassical approaches have significantly changed the discipline : marxist political economy , growing out of the work of david harvey ; and the new economic geography which takes into account social , cultural , and institutional factors in the spatial economy . economists such as paul krugman and jeffrey sachs have also analyzed many traits related to economic geography . krugman called his application of spatial thinking to international trade theory the '' new economic geography '' , which directly competes with an approach within the discipline of geography that is also called '' new economic geography '' . from s.n . durlauf and l.e . blume , ed .

state ) , which date to the 4th century bc and in the greek geographer strabo 's geographika , compiled almost 2000 years ago . as cartography developed , geographers illuminated many aspects used today in the field ; maps created by different european powers described the resources likely to be found in american , african , and asian territories . the earliest travel journals included descriptions of the native peoples , the climate , the landscape , and the productivity of various locations . these early accounts encouraged the development of transcontinental trade patterns and ushered in the era of mercantilism . world war ii contributed to the popularization of geographical knowledge generally , and post-war economic recovery and development contributed to the growth of economic geography as a discipline . during environmental determinism 's time of popularity , ellsworth huntington and his theory of climatic determinism , while later greatly criticized , notably influenced the field . valuable contributions also came from location theorists such as johann heinrich von thünen or alfred weber . other influential theories include walter christaller 's central place theory , the theory of core and periphery . fred k . schaefer 's article '' exceptionalism in geography : a methodological examination '' , published in the american journal annals of the association of american geographers , and his critique of regionalism , made a large impact on the field : the article became a rallying point for the younger generation of economic geographers who were intent on reinventing the discipline as a science , and quantitative methods began to prevail in research . well-known economic geographers of this period include william garrison , brian berry , waldo tobler , peter haggett and william bunge . contemporary economic geographers tend to specialize in areas such as location theory and spatial analysis ( with the help of geographic information systems ) , market research , geography of transportation , real estate price evaluation , regional and global development , planning , internet geography , innovation , social networks . . approaches to study . as economic geography is a very broad discipline , with economic geographers using many different methodologies in the study of economic phenomena in the world some distinct approaches to study have evolved over time : theoretical economic geography focuses on building theories about spatial arrangement and distribution of economic activities . regional economic geography examines the economic conditions of particular regions or countries of the world . it deals with economic regionalization as well as local economic growth . historical economic geography examines the history and development of spatial economic structure . using historical data , it examines how centers of population and economic activity shift , what patterns of regional specialization and localization evolve over time and what factors explain these changes . evolutionary economic geography adopts an evolutionary approach to economic geography . more specifically , evolutionary economic geography uses concepts and ideas from evolutionary economics to understand the evolution of cities , regions , and other economic systems . critical economic geography is an approach taken from the point of view of contemporary critical geography and its philosophy . behavioral economic geography examines the cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning , locational decision making , and behavior of firms and individuals . economic geography is sometimes approached as a branch of human geography that focuses on regional systems of human economic activity . an alternative description of different approaches to the study of human economic activity can be organized around spatiotemporal analysis , analysis of production/consumption of economic items , and analysis of economic flow . spatiotemporal systems of analysis include economic activities of region , mixed social spaces , and development . alternatively , analysis may focus on production , exchange , distribution , and consumption of items of economic activity . allowing parameters of space-time and item to vary , a geographer may also examine material flow , commodity flow , population flow and information flow from different parts of the economic activity system . through analysis of flow and production , industrial areas , rural and urban residential areas , transportation site , commercial service facilities and finance and other economic centers are linked together in an economic activity system . branches . thematically , economic geography can be divided into these subdisciplines : agricultural geography it is traditionally considered the branch of economic geography that investigates those parts of the earth 's surface that are transformed by humans through primary sector activities . it thus focuses on structures of agricultural landscapes and asks for the processes that lead to these spatial patterns . while most research in this area concentrates rather on production than on consumption,1 a distinction can be made between nomothetic ( e.g . distribution of spatial agricultural patterns and processes ) and idiographic research ( e.g . human-environment interaction and the shaping of agricultural landscapes ) . the latter approach of agricultural geography is often applied within regional geography . geography of industry geography of international trade geography of resources geography of transport and communication geography of finance these areas of study may overlap with other geography . economists and economic geographers . generally , spatially interested economists study the effects of space on the economy . geographers , on the other hand , are interested in the economic processes ' impact on spatial structures . moreover , economists and economic geographers differ in their methods in approaching spatial-economic problems in several ways . an economic geographer will often take a more holistic approach to the analysis of economic phenomena , which is to conceptualize a problem in terms of space , place , and scale as well as the overt economic problem that is being examined . the economist approach , according to some economic geographers , has the main drawback of homogenizing the economic world in ways economic geographers try to avoid . . variation by industry . industries have different patterns of economic geography . extractive industries tend to be concentrated around their specific natural resources . in norway , for example , most oil industry jobs occur within a single electoral district . industries are geographically concentrated if they do not need to be close to their end customers , such as the automotive industry concentration in detroit , us . agriculture also tends to be concentrated . industries are geographically diffuse if they need to be close to their end customers , such as hairdressers , restaurants , and the hospitality industry . . new economic geography . with the rise of the new economy , economic inequalities are increasing spatially . the new economy , generally characterized by globalization , increasing use of information and communications technology , the growth of knowledge goods , and feminization , has enabled economic geographers to study social and spatial divisions caused by the rising new economy , including the emerging digital divide . the new economic geographies consist of primarily service-based sectors of the economy that use innovative technology , such as industries where people rely on computers and the internet . within these is a switch from manufacturing-based economies to the digital economy . in these sectors , competition makes technological changes robust . these high technology sectors rely heavily on interpersonal relationships and trust , as developing things like software is very different from other kinds of industrial manufacturing—it requires intense levels of cooperation between many different people , as well as the use of tacit knowledge . as a result of cooperation becoming a necessity , there is a clustering in the high-tech new economy of many firms . social and spatial divisions . as characterized through the work of diane perrons , in anglo-american literature , the new economy consists of two distinct types . new economic geography 1 ( neg1 ) is characterized by sophisticated spatial modelling . it seeks to explain uneven development and the emergence of business cluster . it does so through the exploration of linkages between centripetal and centrifugal forces , especially those of economies of scale . new economic geography 2 ( neg2 ) also seeks to explain the apparently paradoxical emergence of industrial clusters in a contemporary context , however , it emphasizes relational , social , and contextual aspects of economic behaviour , particularly the importance of tacit knowledge . the main difference between these two types is neg2 's emphasis on aspects of economic behaviour that neg1 considers intangible . both new economic geographies acknowledge transport costs , the importance of knowledge in a new economy , possible effects of externalities , and endogenous processes that generate increases in productivity . the two also share a focus on the firm as the most important unit and on growth rather than development of regions . as a result , the actual impact of clusters on a region is given far less attention , relative to the focus on clustering of related activities in a region . however , the focus on the firm as the main entity of significance hinders the discussion of new economic geography . it limits the discussion in a national and global context and confines it to a smaller scale context . it also places limits on the nature of the firm 's activities and their position within the global value chain . further work done by bjorn asheim ( 2001 ) and gernot grabher ( 2002 ) challenges the idea of the firm through action-research approaches and mapping organizational forms and their linkages . in short , the focus on the firm in new economic geographies is undertheorized in neg1 and undercontextualized in neg2 , which limits the discussion of its impact on spatial economic development . spatial divisions within these arising new economic geographies are apparent in the form of the digital divide , as a result of regions attracting talented workers instead of developing skills at a local level ( see creative class for further reading ) . despite increasing inter-connectivity through developing information communication technologies , the contemporary world is still defined through its widening social and spatial divisions , most of which are increasingly gendered . danny quah explains these spatial divisions through the characteristics of knowledge goods in the new economy : goods defined by their infinite expansibility , weightlessness , and nonrivalry . social divisions are expressed through new spatial segregation that illustrates spatial sorting by income , ethnicity , abilities , needs , and lifestyle preferences . employment segregation is evidence by the overrepresentation of women and ethnic minorities in lower-paid service sector jobs . these divisions in the new economy are much more difficult to overcome as a result of few clear pathways of progression to higher-skilled work . see also . business cluster creative class development geography gravity model of trade geography and wealth location theory new economy regional science retail geography rural
