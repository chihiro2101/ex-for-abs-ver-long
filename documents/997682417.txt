Thomas Corneille

biography . born in rouen some nineteen years after his brother pierre , the '' great corneille '' , thomas 's skill as a poet seems to have shown itself early . at the age of fifteen he composed a play in latin which was performed by his fellow-pupils at the jesuit school in rouen , the collège de bourbon ( now the lycée pierre corneille ) . his first play in the french language , les engagements du hasard , was probably first performed at the hôtel de bourgogne in 1647 , although not published until 1656 . clarke 2007 , pp . 8–11 . le feint astrologue , imitated from the spanish of pedro calderón de la barca , and itself imitated in dryden 's an evening 's love , came the following year . after his brother 's death , thomas succeeded his vacant chair in the académie française . he then turned his attention to philology , producing a new edition of the remarques of cf vaugelas in 1687 . his le dictionnaire des arts et des sciences first appeared in 1694 as a supplement to the first edition of dictionnaire de l'académie française—also published that year—and as a competitor to furetière 's dictionaire universel of 1690 . corneille 's dictionnaire is regarded by kafker as one of the nine notable encyclopaedias of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that preceded diderot and d'alembert 's encyclopédie . a complete translation of ovid 's metamorphoses ( he had published six books with the heroic epistles some years previously ) followed in 1697 . in 1704 he lost his sight and was constituted a '' veteran , '' a dignity which gave him the privileges of an academician , while exempting him from the duties . he did not allow his blindness to put a stop to his work , however , and in 1708 produced a large dictionnaire universel géographique et historique in three volumes folio . this was his last major work . he died at les andelys at the age of eighty-four . list of plays . les engagements du hasard ( 1647 ) le feint astrologue ( 1648 ) don bertrand de cigarral ( 1650 ) l'amour à la mode ( 1651 ) le charme de la voix ( 1653 ) les illustres ennemis ( 1654 ) le geolier de soi-même ( 1655 ) timocrate ( 1656 ) bérénice ( 1657 ) la mort de l'empereur commode ( 1658 ) stilicon ( 1660 ) le galant doublé ( 1660 ) camma ( 1661 ) maximian ( 1662 ) persée et démétrius ( 1663 ) antiochus ( 1666 ) laodice ( 1668 ) le baron d'albikrac ( 1668 ) la mort d'annibal ( 1669 ) la comtesse d'orgueil ( 1670 ) ariane ( 1672 ) la mort d ’ achille ( 1673 ) . don césar d'avalos ( 1674 ) circé ( 1675 ) l'inconnu ( 1675 ) le festin de pierre ( 1677 ) le triomphe des dames ( 1676 ) le comte d'essex ( 1678 ) la devineresse ( 1679 ) bradamante ( 1695 ) . opera libretto . médée for charpentier ( 1693 , adapted from pierre corneille 's play and euripides ) . place in french literature . thomas corneille has often been regarded as one who , but for his surname , would merit no notice . others feel he was unlucky in having a brother ( pierre corneille ) who outshone him , as he would have outshone almost anyone else . in 1761 voltaire wrote of thomas corneille : ‘ si vous exceptez racine , auquel il ne faut comparer personne , il était le seul de son temps qui fût digne d ’ être le premier au-dessous de son frère ' voltaire , '' commentaires sur corneille '' , in oeuvres complètes de voltaire , liii-lv , ed . david williams ( banbury , voltaire foundation , 1973–1975 ) , lv , p . 979 . ( if you except racine , to whom nobody can be compared , he was the first of his time who was worthy to be behind his brother ) . the brothers were close , and practically lived together . of his forty-two plays ( the highest number assigned to him ) , the last edition of his complete works contains only thirty-two dramas , but he wrote several in collaboration with other authors . two are usually reprinted as his masterpieces at the end of his brother 's selected works . these are ariane ( 1672 ) and the le comte d'essex ( the earl of essex ( 1678 ) ) , in the former of which rachel attained success . ( an oil painting depicting a scene from le comte d'essex is in the hermitage museum . ) but of laodice , camma , stilico and some other pieces , pierre corneille himself said that '' he wished he had written them , '' and he was not wont to speak lightly . camma ( 1661 , on the same story as tennyson 's cup ) deserves special notice . thomas corneille is remarkable in the literary gossip-history of his time . his timocrate boasted of the longest run ( 80 nights ) recorded of any play during the century . for la devineresse , he and his cowriter jean donneau de visé , founder of the mercure galant ( to which thomas contributed ) , received over 6,000 livres , the largest sum known to have been paid during that period . lastly , one of his pieces ( le baron des fondrières ) claims the honor of being the first which was booed off the stage . thomas corneille is also remarkable for having excelled in almost all dramatic genres of his time , including the new and innovative genres that were the pièce à machines and opera at the time . his machine play circé was among the most successful of the century . his three opera librettoes , psyché ( 1678 ) , bellérophon ( 1679 ) and médée ( 1693 ) make him , next to philippe quinault and jean galbert de campistron , one of the most important french librettists of the seventeenth century . in a letter to her father , shortly before her execution , charlotte corday quotes thomas corneille : '' le crime fait la honte , et non pas l ’ échafaud ! '' ( the crime causes the shame , and not the scaffold ! ) . references . ; notes ; sources clarke , jan ( 2007 ) . the guénégaud theatre in paris ( 1673–1680 ) . volume three : the demise of the machine play . lewiston , ny : the edwin mellen press . external links . biography , bibliography , analysis , plot overview ( in french ) an article on thomas corneille on the french studies website circé ( french version ) . further reading . collins , david a .
