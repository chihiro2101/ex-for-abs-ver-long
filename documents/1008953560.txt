Manfred Mann

history . beginnings ( 1962–1963 ) . the mann & ndash ; hugg blues brothers were formed in london by keyboard player manfred mann and drummer/vibes/piano player mike hugg , who formed a house band in clacton-on-sea that also featured graham bond . bringing a shared love of jazz to the british blues boom then sweeping london 's clubs , the band was completed by mike vickers on guitar , alto saxophone and flute , bassist dave richmond and paul jones as lead vocalist and harmonicist . by this time they had changed their name to manfred mann & the manfreds . gigging throughout late 1962 and early 1963 , they soon attracted attention for their distinctive sound . after changing their name to manfred mann at the behest of their label 's producer john burgess , the group signed with his master 's voice in march 1963 and began their recorded output that july with the slow , blues instrumental single '' why should we not ? '' , which they performed on their first appearance on television on a new year 's eve show . it failed to chart , as did its follow-up ( with vocals ) , '' cock-a-hoop '' . the overdubbed instrumental soloing on woodwinds , vibes , harmonica and second keyboard lent considerable weight to the group 's sound , and demonstrated the jazz-inspired technical prowess in which they took pride . . early success ( 1964–1965 ) . in 1964 , the group was asked to provide a new theme tune for the itv pop music television programme ready steady go ! . they responded with '' 5-4-3-2-1 '' which , with the help of weekly television exposure , rose to no . 5 in the uk singles chart . shortly after '' 5-4-3-2-1 '' was recorded , richmond left the band , jazz4now – the dave richmond home page '' please note that '' 5-4-3-2-1 '' was recorded before i left the band , in fact i still receive ppl payments every time it is broadcast '' – dave richmond though he would record with them occasionally later . he was replaced by jones ' friend tom mcguinness—the first of many changes . after a further self-penned hit , '' hubble bubble ( toil and trouble ) '' , the band struck gold with '' do wah diddy diddy '' , a cover version of the exciters ' no . 78 hot 100 hit earlier that year . the track reached the top of the uk , canadian , and us charts . with the success of '' do wah diddy diddy '' the sound of the group 's singles moved away from the jazzy , blues-based music of their early years to a pop hybrid that continued to make hit singles from cover material . they hit no . 3 in the uk with another girl-group cover , '' sha la la '' , ( originally by the shirelles ) which also reached no . 12 in the us and canada , and followed it with the sentimental '' come tomorrow '' ( originally by marie knight ) but both were of a noticeably lighter texture than their earliest output . meanwhile , '' b '' sides and four-song eps showcased original material and instrumental solos . the group also returned to jazz and r & b themes on their albums : their first , 1964 's the five faces of manfred mann , included standards such as '' smokestack lightning '' while the second and last with this line-up , mann made , offered several self-composed instrumentals and a version of '' stormy monday blues '' alongside novelties and pop ballads . with a cover of maxine brown 's '' oh no not my baby '' began a phase of new depth and sophistication in the arrangements of their singles . the group began its string of successes with bob dylan songs with a track on the best-selling ep the one in the middle , '' with god on our side '' , next reaching no . 2 in the uk with '' if you got ta go , go now '' . the ep 's title track reached the british top ten singles , the last self-written song ( by jones ) and the band 's last r ' n ' b workout to do so . the run climaxed with a second uk no . 1 single , '' pretty flamingo '' , produced by john burgess . the group had managed an initial jazz/rhythm-and-blues fusion , and then had taken chart music in their stride—but could not hope to cope with paul jones ' projected solo career as singer and actor , and with mike vickers ' orchestral and instrumental ambitions . jones intended to go solo once a replacement could be found , but stayed with the band for another year , during which vickers left . mcguinness moved to guitar , his original instrument , contributing the distinctive national steel guitar to '' if you got ta go , go now '' and '' pretty flamingo '' , and was replaced on bass by jack bruce , who had been playing for the graham bond organisation for some time before a recent brief stint with john mayall 's bluesbreakers . in his brief tenure before leaving to form cream , bruce played on '' pretty flamingo '' and on the ep instrumental asylum ( for which both he , and wind instrumentalists henry lowther and lyn dobson , were included in the sleeve photo of the group ) , which began the group 's experiments with instrumental versions of chart songs . he was replaced by klaus voormann . the band changed record companies just afterward , although emi quickly released an ep of earlier unissued 1963–66 era songs titled as was ( a pun on the title of their then new 1966 album , as is ) , a hits compilation ; mann made hits ( 1966 ) , an instrumental compilation lp that included one unissued instrumental track ; soul of mann ( 1967 ) ; and most controversially used session players to complete the unfinished track '' you gave me somebody to love '' ( c/w 'poison ivy '' —both sung by paul jones ) which made no . 36 in the uk singles chart , upsetting the group—hence mcguinness 's wry comment '' manfreds disown new single '' on the sleeve of their next studio album for their new record label . mike d'abo years ( 1966–1969 ) . jones was replaced by mike d'abo in july 1966 , and the group switched labels to fontana records , where they were produced by shel talmy . their first fontana single , a version of dylan 's '' just like a woman '' , released in july , scraped into the uk top ten and reached number one in sweden . their new long-player , as is , followed in october ; the group 's increased studio technique sidelined their jazz , soul and blues roots . the next two singles , '' semi-detached , suburban mr james '' and '' ha ha said the clown '' , both reached the top 5 . another ep set of instrumentals , instrumental assassination , was released in december . this featured original member dave richmond on double bass , but not mike d'abo , suggesting the sessions dated from a little earlier in 1966 . an instrumental version of tommy roe 's '' sweet pea '' only reached no . 36 when issued as a single and the follow-up , randy newman 's '' so long , dad '' , with its intricate keyboard arrangement , missed the top twenty altogether . thus , 1967 was for the group largely an unsuccessful year in the charts , besides '' ha ha said the clown '' which reached the uk singles chart early in 1967 . there was no album , as mann and hugg explored other avenues of their career , although their record company did compile the uk budget-priced album what a mann ( fontana sfl 13003 ) , a predominantly instrumental set gathering together a few recent singles ' a-sides , b-sides , and instrumental ep tracks . the following year 1968 brought two albums , the mann–hugg soundtrack to the film up the junction in february , from which an edited title track coupled with the rare b-side '' sleepy hollow '' was issued as an unsuccessful uk single ; and mighty garvey ! in july . they had a resounding success with '' mighty quinn '' , their third uk no . 1 and third hit dylan song , which also peaked at no . 3 in canada and no . 10 in the us . in june 1968 , the following single , john simon 's '' my name is jack '' , was recalled when the us company mercury records complained about the phrase '' super spade '' in the lyrics , which referred to a haight-ashbury drug dealer . the release was delayed by a week until the offending name was re-recorded as '' superman '' , but the uk hit single version retained the original lyric . their december 1968 release , '' fox on the run '' , reached no . 5 in the uk . frustrated with the limitations and image of being seen purely as a hit singles band ( their last two albums failed to chart ) , the group split in 1969 . . aftermath . mann and hugg were already writing advertising jingles at the time of the group 's demise , but continued to work together in a group format with manfred mann chapter three , an experimental jazz rock band described by mann as an over-reaction to the hit factory of the manfred mann group . manfred mann 's earth band – history of the band platform end on-line for a moment their musical worlds coincided : a tv cigar advertisement , a long track from chapter three 's first album travellin ' lady , and '' a '' b '' side '' , the flip of the old group 's last single , all used the same riff . however , the new group was short-lived and by 1971 after a second album ( and an unreleased possibly incomplete third ) they had disbanded and mann had formed a new group . the original line-up of this new group consisted of mick rogers ( guitar and vocals ) , manfred mann ( organ , synthesizer and vocals ) , colin pattenden ( bass guitar ) and chris slade ( drums and vocals ) . in its very earliest stages , the band was simply billed as 'manfred mann ' and thus a continuation of the 1960s group . the quartet ( as 'manfred mann ' ) released their first single , '' please mrs . henry '' , in 1971 . their second single , randy newman 's '' living without you '' , was also released by 'manfred mann ' in europe , but by 'manfred mann 's earth band ' in the us , where the track became a minor chart hit . from 1972 onward 'manfred mann 's earth band ' was the band name used on all releases by this group , and they are considered a separate band from manfred mann . manfred mann briefly reformed in june 1983 , for an appearance at the marquee club in london to help celebrate the club 's 25th anniversary . in the 1990s , most of the original 1960s line-up reformed as the manfreds , minus manfred mann himself ( hence the name ) , playing most of the old 1960s hits and a few jazz instrumentals , sometimes with both paul jones and mike d'abo fronting the line-up . tom mcguinness formed mcguinness flint in 1970 , scoring a few hits before they disbanded in 1975 . both jones and mcguinness have been mainstays of the blues band , which they helped form in 1978 . in 2009 , the manfreds ( d'abo , hugg , jones and mcguinness ) joined klaus voormann in performing a version of '' mighty quinn '' for his first solo collection a sideman 's journey , credited to 'voormann & friends ' . personnel . manfred mann – keyboards ( 1962–1969 ) mike hugg – drums , vibes , keyboards ( 1962–1969 ) paul jones – vocals , harmonica ( 1962–1966 ) mike vickers – guitar , alto sax , flute ( 1962–1965 ) dave richmond – bass ( 1962–1964 ) tom mcguinness – bass ( 1964–1965 ) , guitar ( 1965–1969 ) jack bruce – bass ( 1965–1966 ;
