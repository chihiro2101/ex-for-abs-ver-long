Hovercraft

history . early efforts . there have been many attempts to understand the principles of high air pressure below hulls and wings . hovercraft are unique in that they can lift themselves while still , differing from ground effect vehicles and hydrofoils which require forward motion to create lift . the first mention in the historical record of the concepts behind surface-effect vehicles that used the term hovering was by swedish scientist emanuel swedenborg in 1716 . the shipbuilder sir john isaac thornycroft patented an early design for an air cushion ship / hovercraft in the 1870s , but suitable , powerful , engines were not available until the 20th century . in 1915 , the austrian dagobert müller von thomamühl ( 1880–1956 ) built the world 's first '' air cushion '' boat . shaped like a section of a large aerofoil ( this creates a low pressure area above the wing much like an aircraft ) , the craft was propelled by four aero engines driving two submerged marine propellers , with a fifth engine that blew air under the front of the craft to increase the air pressure under it . only when in motion could the craft trap air under the front , increasing lift . the vessel also required a depth of water to operate and could not transition to land or other surfaces . designed as a fast torpedo boat , the had a top speed over . it was thoroughly tested and even armed with torpedoes and machine guns for operation in the adriatic . it never saw actual combat , however , and as the war progressed it was eventually scrapped due to the lack of interest and perceived need , and its engines returned to the air force . the theoretical grounds for motion over an air layer were constructed by konstantin eduardovich tsiolkovskii in 1926 and 1927 . '' in 1929 , andrew kucher of ford began experimenting with the levapad concept , metal disks with pressurized air blown through a hole in the center . levapads do not offer stability on their own . several must be used together to support a load above them . lacking a skirt , the pads had to remain very close to the running surface . he initially imagined these being used in place of casters and wheels in factories and warehouses , where the concrete floors offered the smoothness required for operation . by the 1950s , ford showed a number of toy models of cars using the system , but mainly proposed its use as a replacement for wheels on trains , with the levapads running close to the surface of existing rails . '' cars that fly '' , modern mechanix , october 1959 , pp . 91-95 in 1931 , finnish aero engineer toivo j . kaario began designing a developed version of a vessel using an air cushion and built a prototype ( 'surface soarer ' ) , in 1937 . kaario 's design included the modern features of a lift engine blowing air into a flexible envelope for lift . kaario never received funding to build his design , however . kaario 's efforts were followed closely in the soviet union by vladimir levkov , who returned to the solid-sided design of the . levkov designed and built a number of similar craft during the 1930s , and his l-5 fast-attack boat reached in testing . however , the start of world war ii put an end to levkov 's development work . during world war ii , an american engineer , charles fletcher , invented a walled air cushion vehicle , the glidemobile . because the project was classified by the u.s . government , fletcher could not file a patent . . sir christopher cockerell . the idea of the modern hovercraft is most often associated with a british mechanical engineer christopher cockerell . cockerell 's group was the first to develop the use of a ring of air for maintaining the cushion , the first to develop a successful skirt , and the first to demonstrate a practical vehicle in continued use . cockerell came across the key concept in his design when studying the ring of airflow when high-pressure air was blown into the annular area between two concentric tin cans ( one coffee and the other from cat food ) and a hair dryer . this produced a ring of airflow , as expected , but he noticed an unexpected benefit as well ; the sheet of fast moving air presented a sort of physical barrier to the air on either side of it . this effect , which he called the '' momentum curtain '' , could be used to trap high-pressure air in the area inside the curtain , producing a high-pressure plenum that earlier examples had to build up with considerably more airflow . in theory , only a small amount of active airflow would be needed to create lift and much less than a design that relied only on the momentum of the air to provide lift , like a helicopter . in terms of power , a hovercraft would only need between one quarter to one half of the power required by a helicopter . cockerell built and tested several models of his hovercraft design in somerleyton , suffolk , during the early 1950s . the design featured an engine mounted to blow from the front of the craft into a space below it , combining both lift and propulsion . he demonstrated the model flying over many whitehall carpets in front of various government experts and ministers , and the design was subsequently put on the secret list . in spite of tireless efforts to arrange funding , no branch of the military was interested , as he later joked , '' the navy said it was a plane not a boat ; the air force said it was a boat not a plane ; and the army was 'plain not interested . ' '' '' air apparent '' , maritime defence management journal , issue 47 a memorial to cockerell 's first design stands in the village of somerleyton . sr.n1 . this lack of military interest meant that there was no reason to keep the concept secret , and it was declassified . cockerell was finally able to convince the national research development corporation to fund development of a full-scale model . in 1958 , the nrdc placed a contract with saunders-roe for the development of what would become the sr.n1 , short for '' saunders-roe , nautical 1 '' . the sr.n1 was powered by a 450 & nbsp ; hp alvis leonides engine powering a vertical fan in the middle of the craft . in addition to providing the lift air , a portion of the airflow was bled off into two channels on either side of the craft , which could be directed to provide thrust . in normal operation this extra airflow was directed rearward for forward thrust , and blew over two large vertical rudders that provided directional control . for low-speed maneuverability , the extra thrust could be directed fore or aft , differentially for rotation . the sr.n1 made its first hover on 11 june 1959 , and made its famed successful crossing of the english channel on 25 july 1959 . in december 1959 , the duke of edinburgh visited saunders-roe at east cowes and persuaded the chief test-pilot , commander peter lamb , to allow him to take over the sr.n1 's controls . he flew the sr.n1 so fast that he was asked to slow down a little . on examination of the craft afterwards , it was found that she had been dished in the bow due to excessive speed , damage that was never allowed to be repaired , and was from then on affectionately referred to as the 'royal dent' . raymond wheeler , '' from river to sea '' , cross publishing , 1993 . skirts and other improvements . testing quickly demonstrated that the idea of using a single engine to provide air for both the lift curtain and forward flight required too many trade-offs . a turbomeca marboré turbojet for forward thrust and two large vertical rudders for directional control were added , producing the sr.n1 mk ii . a further upgrade with the armstrong siddeley viper produced the mk iii . further modifications , especially the addition of pointed nose and stern areas , produced the mk iv . although the sr.n1 was successful as a testbed , the design hovered too close to the surface to be practical ; at even small waves would hit the bow . the solution was offered by c.h . latimer-needham , following a suggestion made by his business partner arthur ord-hume . in 1958 , he suggested the use of two rings of rubber to produce a double-walled extension of the vents in the lower fuselage . when air was blown into the space between the sheets it exited the bottom of the skirt in the same way it formerly exited the bottom of the fuselage , re-creating the same momentum curtain , but this time at some distance from the bottom of the craft . latimer-needham and cockerell devised a high skirt design , which was fitted to the sr.n1 to produce the mk v , bill gunston , '' hydrofoils and hovercraft : new vehicles for sea and land '' , doubleday , 1969 , p.93 displaying hugely improved performance , with the ability to climb over obstacles almost as high as the skirt . in october 1961 , latimer-needham sold his skirt patents to westland , who had recently taken over saunders roe 's interest in the hovercraft . as part of consolidation of british helicopter activities by several aero companies into one experiments with the skirt design demonstrated a problem ; it was originally expected that pressure applied to the outside of the skirt would bend it inward , and the now-displaced airflow would cause it to pop back out . what actually happened is that the slight narrowing of the distance between the walls resulted in less airflow , which in turn led to more air loss under that section of the skirt . the fuselage above this area would drop due to the loss of lift at that point , and this led to further pressure on the skirt . after considerable experimentation , denys bliss at hovercraft development ltd . found the solution to this problem . instead of using two separate rubber sheets to form the skirt , a single sheet of rubber was bent into a u shape to provide both sides , with slots cut into the bottom of the u forming the annular vent . when deforming pressure was applied to the outside of this design , air pressure in the rest of the skirt forced the inner wall to move in as well , keeping the channel open . although there was some deformation of the curtain , the airflow within the skirt was maintained and the lift remained relatively steady . over time , this design evolved into individual extensions over the bottom of the slots in the skirt , known as '' fingers '' . commercialization . through these improvements , the hovercraft became an effective transport system for high-speed service on water and land , leading to widespread developments for military vehicles , search and rescue , and commercial operations . by 1962 , many uk aviation and ship building firms were working on hovercraft designs , including saunders roe/westland , vickers-armstrong , william denny , britten-norman and folland . small-scale ferry service started as early as 1962 with the launch of the vickers-armstrong va-3 . with the introduction of the 254 passenger and 30 car carrying sr.n4 cross-channel ferry by hoverlloyd and seaspeed in 1968 , hovercraft had developed into useful commercial craft . another major pioneering effort of the early hovercraft era was carried out by jean bertin 's firm in france . bertin was an advocate of the '' multi-skirt '' approach , which used a number of smaller cylindrical skirts instead of one large one in order to avoid the problems noted above . during the early 1960s he developed a series of prototype designs , which he called '' terraplanes '' if they were aimed for land use , and '' naviplanes '' for water . the best known of these designs was the n500 naviplane , built for seaspeed by the société d'etude et de développement des aéroglisseurs marins ( sedam ) . the n500 could carry 400 passengers , 55 cars and five buses . it set a speed record between boulogne and dover of . it was rejected by its operators , who claimed that it was unreliable . another discovery was that the total amount of air needed to lift the craft was a function of the roughness of the surface it travelled over . on flat surfaces , like pavement , the needed air pressure was so low that hovercraft were able to compete in energy terms with conventional systems like steel wheels . however , as the hovercraft lift system acted as both a lift and very effective suspension , it naturally lent itself to high-speed use where conventional suspension systems were considered too complex . this led to a variety of '' hovertrain '' proposals during the 1960s , including england 's tracked hovercraft and france 's aérotrain . in the u.s . , rohr inc . and garrett both took out licenses to develop local versions of the aérotrain . these designs competed with maglev systems in the high-speed arena , where their primary advantage was the very '' low tech '' tracks they needed . on the downside , the air blowing dirt and trash out from under the trains presented a unique problem in stations , and interest in them waned in the 1970s . by the early 1970s , the basic concept had been well developed , and the hovercraft had found a number of niche roles where its combination of features were advantageous . today , they are found primarily in military use for amphibious operations , search and rescue vehicles in shallow water , and sporting vehicles . design . hovercraft can be powered by one or more engines . small craft , such as the sr.n6 , usually have one engine with the drive split through a gearbox . on vehicles with several engines , one usually drives the fan ( or impeller ) , which is responsible for lifting the vehicle by forcing high pressure air under the craft . the air inflates the '' skirt '' under the vehicle , causing it to rise above the surface . additional engines provide thrust in order to propel the craft . some hovercraft use ducting to allow one engine to perform both tasks by directing some of the air to the skirt , the rest of the air passing out of the back to push the craft forward . uses . commercial . the british aircraft and marine engineering company saunders-roe built the first practical human-carrying hovercraft for the national research development corporation , the sr.n1 , which carried out several test programmes in 1959 to 1961 ( the first public demonstration was in 1959 ) , including a cross-channel test run in july 1959 , piloted by peter '' sheepy '' lamb , an ex-naval test pilot and the chief test pilot at saunders roe . christopher cockerell was on board , and the flight took place on the 50th anniversary of louis blériot 's first aerial crossing . the sr.n1 was powered by a single piston engine , driven by expelled air . demonstrated at the farnborough airshow in 1960 , it was shown that this simple craft can carry a load of up to 12 marines with their equipment as well as the pilot and co-pilot with only a slight reduction in hover height proportional to the load carried . the sr.n1 did not have any skirt , using instead the peripheral air principle that cockerell had patented . it was later found that the craft 's hover height was improved by the addition of a skirt of flexible fabric or rubber around the hovering surface to contain the air . the skirt was an independent invention made by a royal navy officer , c.h . latimer-needham , who sold his idea to westland ( by then the parent of saunders-roe 's helicopter and hovercraft interests ) , and who worked with cockerell to develop the idea further . the first passenger-carrying hovercraft to enter service was the vickers va-3 , which , in the summer of 1962 , carried passengers regularly along the north wales coast from moreton , merseyside , to rhyl . it was powered by two turboprop aero-engines and driven by propellers . during the 1960s , saunders-roe developed several larger designs that could carry passengers , including the sr.n2 , which operated across the solent , in 1962 , and later the sr.n6 , which operated across the solent from southsea to ryde on the isle of wight for many years . in 1963 the sr.n2 was used in experimental service between weston-super-mare and penarth under the aegis of p & a campbell , the paddle steamer operators . operations by hovertravel commenced on 24 july 1965 , using the sr.n6 , which carried 38 passengers . two 98 seat ap1-88 hovercraft were introduced on this route in 1983 , and in 2007 , these were joined by the first 130-seat bht130 craft . the ap1-88 and the bht130 were notable as they were largely built by hoverwork using shipbuilding techniques and materials ( i.e . welded aluminium structure and diesel engines ) rather than the aircraft techniques used to build the earlier craft built by saunders-roe-british hovercraft corporation . over 20 & nbsp ; million passengers had used the service as of 2004 – the service is still operating and is by far the longest , continuously operated hovercraft service . in 1966 , two cross-channel passenger hovercraft services were inaugurated using sr.n6 hovercraft . hoverlloyd ran services from ramsgate harbour , england , to calais , france , and european ferries also started a service to calais from dover , which was soon superseded by that of seaspeed . as well as saunders-roe and vickers ( which combined in 1966 to form the british hovercraft corporation ( bhc ) ) , other commercial craft were developed during the 1960s in the uk by cushioncraft ( part of the britten-norman group ) and hovermarine based at woolston ( the latter being surface effect ship , where the sides of the hull projected down into the water to trap the cushion of air with normal hovercraft skirts at the bow and stern ) . one of these models , the hm-2 , was used by red funnel between southampton ( near the woolston floating bridge ) and cowes . the world 's first car-carrying hovercraft was made in 1968 , the bhc sr.n4 ( sr.n4 ) models , each powered by four bristol proteus turboshaft engines . these were both used by rival operators hoverlloyd and seaspeed ( joined to form hoverspeed in 1981 ) to operate regular car and passenger carrying services across the english channel . hoverlloyd operated from ramsgate , where a special hoverport had been built at pegwell bay , to calais . seaspeed operated from dover , england , to calais and boulogne in france . the first sr.n4 had a capacity of 254 passengers and 30 cars , and a top speed of . the channel crossing took around 30 & nbsp ; minutes and was run like an airline with flight numbers . the later sr.n4 mk.iii had a capacity of 418 passengers and 60 cars . these were later joined by the french-built sedam n500 naviplane with a capacity of 385 passengers and 45 cars ; only one entered service and was used intermittently for a few years on the cross-channel service until returned to sncf in 1983 . the service ceased on 1 october 2000 after 32 & nbsp ; years , due to competition with traditional ferries , catamaran , the disappearance of duty-free shopping within the eu , the advancing age of the sr.n4 hovercraft and the opening of the channel tunnel . the commercial success of hovercraft suffered from rapid rises in fuel prices during the late 1960s and 1970s , following conflict in the middle east . alternative over-water vehicles , such as wave-piercing catamarans ( marketed as the seacat in the uk until 2005 ) , use less fuel and can perform most of the hovercraft 's marine tasks . although developed elsewhere in the world for both civil and military purposes , except for the solent ryde to southsea crossing , hovercraft disappeared from the coastline of britain until a range of griffon hovercraft were bought by the royal national lifeboat institution . hovercraft used to ply between the gateway of india in mumbai and cbd belapur and vashi in navi mumbai between 1994 and 1999 , but the services were subsequently stopped due to the lack of sufficient water transport infrastructure . . civilian non-commercial . in finland , small hovercraft are widely used in maritime rescue and during the rasputitsa ( '' mud season '' ) as archipelago liaison vehicles . in england , hovercraft of the burnham-on-sea area rescue boat ( barb ) are used to rescue people from thick mud in bridgwater bay . avon fire and rescue service became the first local authority fire service in the uk to operate a hovercraft . it is used to rescue people from thick mud in the weston-super-mare area and during times of inland flooding . a griffon rescue hovercraft has been in use for a number of years with the airport fire service at dundee airport in scotland . it is used in the event of an aircraft ditching in the tay estuary . numerous fire departments around the us/canadian great lakes operate hovercraft for water and ice rescues , often of ice fisherman stranded when ice breaks off from shore . the canadian coast guard uses hovercraft to break light ice . in october 2008 , the red cross commenced a flood-rescue service hovercraft based in inverness , scotland . gloucestershire fire and rescue service received two flood-rescue hovercraft donated by severn trent following the 2007 uk floods . since 2006 , hovercraft have been used in aid in madagascar by hoveraid , an international ngo who use the hovercraft to reach the most remote places on the island . the scandinavian airline sas used to charter an ap1-88 hovercraft for regular passengers between copenhagen airport , denmark , and the sas hovercraft terminal in malmö , sweden . in 1998 , the us postal service began using the british built hoverwork ap1-88 to haul mail , freight , and passengers from bethel , alaska , to and from eight small villages along the kuskokwim river . bethel is far removed from the alaska road system , thus making the hovercraft an attractive alternative to the air based delivery methods used prior to introduction of the hovercraft service . hovercraft service is suspended for several weeks each year while the river is beginning to freeze to minimize damage to the river ice surface . the hovercraft is able to operate during the freeze-up period ; however , this could potentially break the ice and create hazards for villagers using their snowmobiles along the river during the early winter . in 2006 , kvichak marine industries of seattle , us built , under license , a cargo/passenger version of the hoverwork bht130 . designated 'suna-x ' , it is used as a high speed ferry for up to 47 passengers and of freight serving the remote alaskan villages of king cove and cold bay . an experimental service was operated in scotland across the firth of forth ( between kirkcaldy and portobello , edinburgh ) , from 16 to 28 july 2007 . marketed as forthfast , the service used a craft chartered from hovertravel and achieved an 85 % passenger load factor . , the possibility of establishing a permanent service is still under consideration . since the channel routes abandoned hovercraft , and pending any reintroduction on the scottish route , the united kingdom 's only public hovercraft service is that operated by hovertravel between southsea ( portsmouth ) and ryde on the isle of wight . from the 1960s , several commercial lines were operated in japan , without much success . in japan the last commercial line had linked ōita airport and central ōita but was shut down in october 2009 . hovercraft are still manufactured in the uk , near to where they were first conceived and tested , on the isle of wight . they can also be chartered for a wide variety of uses including inspections of shallow bed offshore wind farms and vip or passenger use . a typical vessel would be a tiger iv or a griffon . they are light , fast , road transportable and very adaptable with the unique feature of minimising damage to environments . military . the first application of the hovercraft for military use was by the british armed forces , using hovercraft built by saunders-roe . in 1961 , the united kingdom set up the interservice hovercraft trials unit ( ihtu ) based at rnas lee-on-solent ( hms daedalus ) , now the site of the hovercraft museum , near portsmouth . this unit carried out trials on the sr.n1 from mk1 through mk5 as well as testing the sr.n2 , sr.n3 , sr.n5 and sr.n6 craft . the hovercraft trials unit ( far east ) was established by the royal navy at singapore in august 1964 with two armed hovercraft ; they were deployed later that year to tawau in malaysian borneo and operated on waterways there during the indonesia–malaysia confrontation . the hovercraft 's inventor , sir christopher cockerell , claimed late in his life that the falklands war could have been won far more easily had the british military shown more commitment to the hovercraft ; although earlier trials had been conducted in the falkland islands with an srn-6 , the hovercraft unit had been disbanded by the time of the conflict . currently , the royal marines use the griffonhoverwork 2400td hovercraft , the replacement for the griffon 2000 tdx class acv which was deployed operationally by the marines in the 2003 invasion of iraq . in the us , during the 1960s , bell licensed and sold the saunders-roe sr.n5 as the bell sk-5 . they were deployed on trial to the vietnam war by the united states navy as pacv patrol craft in the mekong delta where their mobility and speed was unique . this was used in both the uk sr.n5 curved deck configuration and later with modified flat deck , gun turret and grenade launcher designated the 9255 pacv . the united states army also experimented with the use of sr.n5 hovercraft in vietnam . three hovercraft with the flat deck configuration were deployed to đồng tâm in the mekong delta region and later to ben luc . they saw action primarily in the đồng tháp mười . one was destroyed in early 1970 and another in august of that same year , after which the unit was disbanded . the only remaining u.s . army sr.n5 hovercraft is currently on display in the fort eustis in virginia . experience led to the proposed bell sk-10 , which was the basis for the lcac-class air-cushioned landing craft now deployed by the u.s . and japanese navy . developed and tested in the mid-1970s , the lacv-30 was used by the us army to transport military cargo in logistics-over-the-shore operations from the early 1980s thru the mid 1990s . the soviet union was the world 's largest developer of military hovercraft . their designs range from the small czilim class acv , comparable to the sr.n6 , to the monstrous zubr class lcac , the world 's largest hovercraft . the soviet union was also one of the first nations to use a hovercraft , the bora , as a guided missile corvette , though this craft possessed rigid , non-inflatable sides . with the fall of the soviet union , most soviet military hovercraft fell into disuse and disrepair . only recently has the modern russian navy begun building new classes of military hovercraft . the iranian navy operates multiple british made and some iranian produced hovercraft . the tondar or thunderbolt comes in varieties designed for combat and transportation . iran has equipped the tondar with mid-range missiles , machine guns and retrievable reconnaissance drones . currently they are used for water patrols and combat against drug smugglers . the finnish navy designed an experimental missile attack hovercraft class , tuuli class hovercraft , in the late 1990s . the prototype of the class , tuuli , was commissioned in 2000 . it proved an extremely successful design for a littoral fast attack craft , but due to fiscal reasons and doctrinal change in the navy , the hovercraft was soon withdrawn . the people 's army navy of china operates the jingsah ii class lcac . this troop and equipment carrying hovercraft is roughly the chinese equivalent of the u.s . navy lcac . recreational/sport . small commercially manufactured , kit or plan-built hovercraft are increasingly being used for recreational purposes , such as inland racing and cruising on inland lakes and rivers , marshy areas , estuaries and inshore coastal waters . the hovercraft cruising club supports the use of hovercraft for cruising in coastal and inland waterways , lakes and lochs . the hovercraft club of great britain , founded in 1966 , regularly organizes inland and coastal hovercraft race events at various venues across the united kingdom . in august 2010 , the hovercraft club of great britain hosted the world hovercraft championships at towcester racecourse the world hovercraft championships are run under the auspices of the world hovercraft federation . similar events are also held in europe and the us . apart from the craft designed as '' racing hovercraft '' , which are often only suitable for racing , there is another form of small personal hovercraft for leisure use , often referred to as cruising hovercraft , capable of carrying up to four people . just like their full size counterparts , the ability of these small personal hovercraft to safely cross all types of terrain , ( e.g . water , sandbanks , swamps , ice , etc . ) and reach places often inaccessible by any other type of craft , makes them suitable for a number of roles , such as survey work and patrol and rescue duties in addition to personal leisure use . increasingly , these craft are being used as yacht tenders , enabling yacht owners and guests to travel from a waiting yacht to , for example , a secluded beach . in this role , small hovercraft can offer a more entertaining alternative to the usual small boat and can be a rival for the jet-ski . the excitement of a personal hovercraft can now be enjoyed at '' experience days '' , which are popular with families , friends and those in business , who often see them as team building exercises . this level of interest has naturally led to a hovercraft rental sector and numerous manufacturers of small , ready built designs of personal hovercraft to serve the need . . other uses . . hoverbarge . a real benefit of air cushion vehicles in moving heavy loads over difficult terrain , such as swamps , was overlooked by the excitement of the british government funding to develop high-speed hovercraft . it was not until the early 1970s that the technology was used for moving a modular marine barge with a dragline on board for use over soft reclaimed land . mackace ( mackley air cushion equipment ) , now known as hovertrans , produced a number of successful hoverbarges , such as the 250 & nbsp ; ton payload '' sea pearl '' , which operated in abu dhabi , and the twin 160 & nbsp ; ton payload '' yukon princesses '' , which ferried trucks across the yukon river to aid the pipeline build . hoverbarges are still in operation today . in 2006 , hovertrans ( formed by the original managers of mackace ) launched a 330-ton payload drilling barge in the swamps of suriname . '' history of the hoverbarge '' . hovertrans the hoverbarge technology is somewhat different from high-speed hovercraft , which has traditionally been constructed using aircraft technology . the initial concept of the air cushion barge has always been to provide a low-tech amphibious solution for accessing construction sites using typical equipment found in this area , such as diesel engines , ventilating fans , winches and marine equipment . the load to move a 200 & nbsp ; ton payload acv barge at would only be 5 & nbsp ; tons . the skirt and air distribution design on high-speed craft again is more complex , as they have to cope with the air cushion being washed out by a wave and wave impact . the slow speed and large mono chamber of the hover barge actually helps reduce the effect of wave action , giving a very smooth ride . the low pull force enabled a boeing 107 helicopter to pull a hoverbarge across snow , ice and water in 1982 . . hovertrains . several attempts have been made to adopt air cushion technology for use in fixed track systems , in order to use the lower frictional forces for delivering high speeds . the most advanced example of this was the aérotrain , an experimental high speed hovertrain built and operated in france between 1965 and 1977 . the project was abandoned in 1977 due to lack of funding , the death of its lead engineer and the adoption of the tgv by the french government as its high-speed ground transport solution . a test track for a tracked hovercraft system was built at earith near cambridge , england . it ran southwest from sutton gault , sandwiched between the old bedford river and the smaller counter drain to the west . careful examination of the site will still reveal traces of the concrete piers used to support the structure . the actual vehicle , rtv31 , is preserved at railworld in peterborough and can be seen from trains , just south west of peterborough railway station . the vehicle achieved on 7 february 1973 but the project was cancelled a week later . the project was managed by tracked hovercraft ltd . , with denys bliss as director in the early 1970s , then axed by the aerospace minister , michael heseltine . records of this project are available from the correspondence and papers of harry legge-bourke at leeds university library . heseltine was accused by airey neave and others of misleading the house of commons when he stated that the government was still considering giving financial support to the hovertrain , when the decision to pull the plug had already been taken by the cabinet . after the cambridge project was abandoned due to financial constraints , parts of the project were picked up by the engineering firm alfred mcalpine , and abandoned in the mid-1980s . the tracked hovercraft project and eric laithwaite maglev train system were contemporaneous , and there was intense competition between the two prospective british systems for funding and credibility . at the other end of the speed spectrum , the u-bahn serfaus has been in continuous operation since 1985 . this is an unusual underground air cushion funicular rapid transit system , situated in the austrian ski resort of serfaus . only long , the line reaches a maximum speed of . a similar system also exists in narita international airport near tokyo , japan . in the late 1960s and early 1970s , the u.s . department of transport 's federal transit administration ( umta ) funded several hovertrain projects , which were known as tracked air cushion vehicles or tacvs . they were also known as aerotrains since one of the builders had a licence from bertin 's aerotrain company . three separate projects were funded . research and development was carried out by rohr , inc . , garrett airesearch and grumman . umta built an extensive test site in pueblo , colorado , with different types of tracks for the different technologies used by the prototype contractors . they managed to build prototypes and do a few test runs before the funding was cut . non-transportation . the hoover constellation was a spherical canister-type vacuum cleaner notable for its lack of wheels . floating on a cushion of air , it was a home hovercraft . they were not especially good as vacuum cleaners as the air escaping from under the cushion blew uncollected dust in all directions , nor as hovercraft as their lack of a skirt meant that they only hovered effectively over a smooth surface . despite this , original constellations are sought-after collectibles today . the flymo is an air-cushion lawn mower that
