Battle of Uclés (1809)

background . after the dos de mayo uprising and the subsequent disaster at the battle of bailén , the french occupying armies in spain were forced to pull back behind the ebro river in the northeast . shocked and enraged at the turn of events , napoleon ordered 130,000 veteran soldiers to march into spain . the french emperor planned to unite the reinforcements with the troops already there and lead them to conquer spain and portugal once and for all . meanwhile , the spanish people had been deceived by their relatively easy successes and believed that the struggle was almost over . the spanish generals and politicians began to squabble among themselves . by 10 october 1808 , napoleon had 244,125 soldiers massed in eight army corps , the cavalry reserve , the imperial guard , and other formations for the purpose of conquering spain . in november 1808 , the napoleonic armies struck with crushing force and the spanish defenses unraveled in battles at burgos , espinosa , tudela , and somosierra . on 1 december , madrid meekly capitulated to napoleon . the french emperor reinstalled his brother joseph bonaparte as king and began rewriting the laws . he intended to send armies to seize seville in the south and reconquer portugal at the first opportunity . however , a new enemy appeared on the scene to upset napoleon 's plans . gates ( 2002 ) , pp . 104-105 on 11 december 1808 , general john moore led a british army numbering 22,500 foot soldiers , 2,500 horsemen , and 66 artillery pieces northeast from salamanca . moore had written to a fellow general , '' if the bubble bursts and madrid falls , we shall have to run for it . '' soon after , moore learned that napoleon had seized madrid and that over 200,000 imperial french troops were in the field . nevertheless , the british general decided to strike at marshal nicolas soult 's isolated ii corps in the north of spain . when the british cavalry routed soult 's horsemen at sahagún on 21 december , the french general was completely surprised . meanwhile , napoleon found out what was going on and ordered 80,000 troops to march north to annihilate the british . getting news of the avalanche coming his way , moore led his army toward corunna in northwest spain . though ultimately the british army was safely evacuated , moore was slain at the battle of corunna on 16 january 1809 and 5,000 of his soldiers died during the mid-winter retreat . because of his unsuccessful effort to destroy moore 's army , napoleon 's plans for conquering spain and portugal were temporarily sidetracked . chandler ( 1966 ) , pp . 655-657 napoleon personally quit spain on 19 january 1809 and never returned . by the 23rd he was in paris , preparing for the next war with the austrian empire . though perhaps 75,000 frenchmen had died in the struggle so far , the emperor hoped that his brother joseph and his marshals would soon complete the conquest of the iberian peninsula . this hope proved to be a vain one . chandler ( 1966 ) , p . 658 . operations . the month of december saw general of division laurent gouvion saint-cyr drub the spanish forces of captain general juan miguel de vives y feliu at the battle of molins de rey while marshal jean lannes began the second siege of zaragoza . with napoleon and his main field army away chasing moore , the imperial troops holding madrid were too weak to mount any offensives . in total , there were 28,000 infantry , 8,000 cavalry , and 90 guns in marshal claude perrin victor 's i corps , marshal françois joseph lefebvre 's iv corps , and the cavalry divisions of generals of division antoine lasalle , marie victor de latour-maubourg , and édouard jean baptiste milhaud . not counted was king joseph 's royal guard consisting of four battalions and one cavalry regiment of frenchmen plus two small regiments of spanish deserters . the cavalry formed the outer line of defense . latour-maubourg posted a cavalry brigade each in tarancón , ocaña , and madridejos . to the west , milhaud 's troopers patrolled the area around talavera de la reina . farthest west were lasalle 's horsemen watching almaraz where there was an important bridge across the tagus river . victor defended aranjuez with general of division eugène-casimir villatte 's division while lefebvre held talavera with the divisions of generals of division horace sebastiani and jean-baptiste cyrus de valence . the 55th line infantry regiment of general of division jean-joseph , marquis dessolles 's absent reserve division was posted at guadalajara . aside from the royal guards , madrid was garrisoned by general of division françois amable ruffin with an i corps division and general of division jean françois leval with a iv corps division . oman ( 1995 ) , p . 3 the army of the center ended its retreat at cuenca on 10 december 1808 . its new commander general pedro de alcántara álvarez de toledo , 13th duke of the infantado allowed his soldiers to rest but was forced to execute three soldiers . one , a lieutenant had refused to march and positioned his artillery battery to fire on the troops who were obeying orders . the remnant of the 1st division was sent home to valencia province to recruit , while the 2nd , 3rd , and 4th divisions oman ( 1995 ) , p . 5 were reorganized into four divisions including a vanguard and a reserve . many low-strength line regiments were consolidated from three battalions into one or two . stragglers and reinforcements swelled the ranks . the soldiers ' spirits rose when a brigade under general conde de alacha lilli marched into camp , having escaped from napoleon 's armies . hearing that the emperor had gone off to the north , infantado decided to launch an offensive toward madrid before his reorganization was completed . oman ( 1995 ) , p . 6 . spanish offensive . on 25 december 1808 , infantado sent general francisco javier venegas with the vanguard and most of the cavalry to seize tarancón while brigadier general senra and 4,000 soldiers moved on aranjuez . senra found villatte 's division at aranjuez and declined to attack , an action for which he was harshly criticized by infantado . meanwhile , venegas managed to encircle general of brigade andré thomas perreimond and his dragoon brigade in tarancón . at the last moment , the french detected what was afoot and hurriedly saddled up their horses . perreimond decided to break out at once . when the dragoons charged the spanish force that had gotten behind the town , the infantry were forced to form squares . perreimond 's troopers then rode between the squares to safety , but not before 50 to 60 saddles were emptied . because the spanish cavalry was late into action , the two dragoon regiments got away without further damage . oman ( 1995 ) , pp . 6-7 farther to the west , on december 24 lefebvre marched to seize the bridge at almaraz as instructed . his soldiers captured the bridge and four cannons in a coup , dispersing the spanish defenders . at this time , the marshal made a remarkable error . leaving only lasalle 's cavalry and two battalions on the tagus , he marched northeast to ávila , ignoring repeated instructions from king joseph to desist . arriving at ávila on 5 january , lefebvre 's corps was completely removed from the defensive lines around madrid . infuriated with his disobedient subordinate , napoleon removed lefebvre from command and gave the iv corps to sébastiani . oman ( 1995 ) , pp . 4-5 with the iv corps out of position , revolts breaking out , and the army of the center threatening madrid , joseph and his adviser marshal jean-baptiste jourdan were in a panic . only villatte and latour-maubourg with 9,000 soldiers stood between infantado and the capital . but , instead of pressing his advantage , the spanish commander became inert between 26 december and 11 january . infantado seems to have spent his time concocting fantastic strategical schemes while leaving his lieutenant venegas without instructions . to support the army of the center , a 6,000-man spanish division under general marquis del palacio moved north from the sierra morena to villaharta . oman ( 1995 ) , pp . 8-9 while infantado dithered , joseph and jourdan moved swiftly against the local insurrections . the 27th light infantry put down the rebellion in chinchón with extreme brutality ; all the men in the town were massacred . colmenar viejo suffered also , with numerous inhabitants being executed . joseph ordered victor to shift east from aranjuez to arganda del rey to block the road from tarancón . on 8 january , the division of dessolles arrived in madrid followed in two days by the return of the iv corps from ávila . these heavy reinforcements allowed napoleon 's defensive scheme around madrid to be reestablished . reinforced by the dutch brigade , leval 's division was sent to garrison talavera while valence 's division was ordered to hold toledo . the divisions of dessolles and sébastiani became the madrid garrison . victor was sent ruffin 's division as a reinforcement and ordered to attack . . battle . victor marched forth on 12 january with 12,000 infantry and 3,500 cavalry in the divisions of ruffin , villatte , latour-maubourg , and the i corps light cavalry . learning of the enemy 's approach , venegas withdrew from tarancón to uclés where he was joined by senra 's brigade . he requested further instructions from the commander of the army of the center but none were forthcoming . instead , infantado sent three or four battalions of reinforcements and advised his lieutenant that he was on the way . however , he did not give any date for his appearance . venegas had reservations about offering battle to victor . but , perhaps swayed by the favorable defensive position at uclés , he decided to stand his ground with approximately 9,500 foot soldiers , 1,800 horsemen , and five cannon , one of which was broken down . though some of the regiments were veterans of bailén , many of the units had shaky morale . oman ( 1995 ) , p . 10 another authority credited venegas with 9,500 infantry , 2,000 cavalry , and 480 artillerists for a total of 11,980 troops . gates ( 2002 ) , p . 117 on 11 january 1809 , infantado 's 21,216-strong army consisted of the 3,929-man vanguard under major general josé maría de la cueva , 14th duke of alburquerque , the 4,295-strong reserve led by lieutenant general manuel la peña , the 5,121-man 1st division commanded by lieutenant general antonio malet , marqués de coupigny , the 5,288-strong 2nd division under major general conde de orgaz , approximately 2,800 cavalry , 383 sappers , and 386 artillerists . venegas ' force was a collection of units drawn piecemeal from all five major units of the army of the center . the vanguard contributed 2,848 men , the reserve 1,634 , the 1st division 2,804 , the 2nd division 1,917 , and the cavalry 1,814 . there were also 383 sappers and about 100 artillerists . oman ( 1995 ) , pp . 621-622 the units from the vanguard were the murcia ( 652 ) , 1st battalion of cantabria ( 315 ) , jaen provincial ( 342 ) , chinchilla provincial ( 354 ) , catalan volunteers ( 499 ) , barbastro cazadores ( 221 ) , and campo mayor ( 465 ) regiments . from the reserve were the 1st battalion of walloon guard ( 425 ) , 1st battalion of irlanda ( 377 ) , and andalucia provincial grenadiers ( 522 ) regiments . from the 1st division came the 1st and 3rd battalions of africa ( 771 ) , 1st and 3rd battalions of burgos ( 519 ) , 3rd of seville ( 106 ) , cuenca provincial ( 626 ) , navas de tolosa ( 542 ) , and cadiz tiradores ( 818 ) regiments . the 2nd division contributed the 1st , 2nd , and 3rd battalions of military orders ( 848 ) , 4th of seville ( 224 ) , toro provincial ( 265 ) , bailen ( 472 ) , and carmona volunteers ( 456 ) regiments . the mounted contingent included the castalla dragoon ( 125 ) , and borbon ( 119 ) , españa ( 342 ) , lusitania ( 158 ) , pavia ( 428 ) , principe ( 141 ) , reyna ( 276 ) , santiago ( 74 ) , and tejas ( 131 ) cavalry regiments . the strength and composition of the imperial units that would fight at uclés were as follows . note that the list includes men present under arms and is from a 1 february 1809 state , which was two weeks after the battle . ruffin 's 5,429-man 1st division of the i corps comprised three battalions each of the 9th light , 24th line , and 96th line infantry regiments . villatte 's 6,376-strong 3rd division of the i corps was made up of three battalions each of the 27th light , 63rd line , 94th line , and 95th line infantry regiments . general of brigade louis-chrétien carrière , baron de beaumont led the 1,386 troopers of the corps cavalry , the 2nd hussar and 5th chasseurs à cheval regiments . the i corps had 48 field pieces manned by 1,523 gunners plus 487 sabers of the westphalian chevau-léger regiment . there were four foot artillery batteries , two per infantry division , plus two additional horse artillery batteries . oman ( 1995 ) , p . 624 general of division pierre belon lapisse 's 2nd division was on detached duty . latour-maubourg 's 2,527-strong 1st dragoon division included the 1st , 2nd , 4th , 9th , 14th , and 26th dragoon regiments . oman ( 1995 ) , p . 627 the three brigades were commanded by generals of brigade perreimond , ignace laurent d'oullemberg , and alexandre , vicomte digeon . oman ( 2010 ) , p . 644 another source stated that victor directed 16,300 men at uclés . of these , ruffin led 5,000 troops , villatte 7,000 , latour-maubourg 2,500 , beaumont 1,300 , and the artillery 500 . venegas strung out his soldiers along a northeast to southwest ridge . three infantry battalions and four cavalry regiments formed an advance guard to watch the approach of the french from tribaldos village . four battalions defended the town of uclés in the center with remaining cavalry and the four guns in front . eight battalions held the right flank , while six battalions deployed on the left flank . venegas held only a single battalion in reserve ; the rest of his units formed a single overextended line . on 13 january , victor marched from tarancón at dawn in two columns . victor with villatte 's and most of latour-maubourg 's divisions took the right-hand road , which was more direct . ruffin 's division and some cavalry took the left-hand road . villatte quickly drove the advance guard out of tribaldos ; it fell back to the main spanish position . after getting a good look at the spanish line , victor ordered ruffin to swing to the right and take venegas in flank and rear . victor deployed villatte 's division and the cavalry , a total of about 7,000 foot soldiers and 2,500 horsemen . in the center , a battery unlimbered and began bombarding the spanish cavalry and uclés . the dragoons were posted behind the artillery . meanwhile , the 94th and 95th line oman ( 1995 ) , p . 11 under general of brigade jacques-pierre-louis puthod oman ( 1995 ) , p . 54 map made a wide sweep to the right . ascending the end of the ridge where the slope was less steep , puthod 's six battalions attacked the spanish left flank and began driving it back . from his vantage point at the monastery in uclés , venegas ordered some units from the right flank to go to the assistance of his imperilled left . however , the french attack proceeded swiftly and crumpled up the spanish left flank before the reinforcements could give any help . puthod 's troops soon reached the walls of uclés . when victor saw the success of his right wing , he ordered villatte 's left wing brigade under general of brigade michel-marie pacthod to attack the spanish right flank . since many of the defending units had been sent to the left , pacthod 's assault easily reached the top of the ridge . shaken by the obvious reverse on the left flank , the right flank troops offered little resistance . soon , venegas 's entire force was retreating from the field . the cavalry seems to have fought hardly at all leaving only two or three battalions under general pedro agustín girón to act as the rear guard . meanwhile , ruffin 's division lost its way and made a wider march than intended . though ruffin was late to the field , he and his troops fortuitously arrived squarely in the spanish rear . latour-maubourg 's pursuing dragoons drove venegas ' hapless soldiers right into the arms of ruffin 's nine battalions . the nimble spanish cavalry largely escaped along with some left flank infantry , while girón 's men broke out between two french regiments . but the majority of the spanish foot soldiers were trapped and forced to surrender . oman ( 1995 ) , p . 12 . results . the french captured four generals , 17 colonels , 306 lower-ranking officers , and 5,560 men for a total of 5,887 prisoners . the i corps also seized four artillery pieces and 20 colors . in addition , the spanish suffered losses of perhaps 1,000 killed and wounded . victor admitted a loss of 150 though another source gave a total of 200 french casualties . despite their easy triumph , the french soldiery got out of control after the battle , sacking uclés and murdering 69 civilians . in particular , monks were singled out for slaughter for allegedly firing on french soldiers . the prisoners were also treated cruelly , according to two french eyewitnesses . when the spaniards were marched to madrid , their captors shot down those who were unable to keep up ; 30 or more men per day were put to death in this manner . meanwhile , infantado with his remaining 9,000 soldiers set out from cuenca on 12 january . by that evening he reached la horcajada , which is east of uclés . continuing their advance on the 13th , infantado 's men came across the remnants of venegas ' force and got word of the disaster . the army commander called for an immediate withdrawal to cuenca . gathering up his wagon train and supplies , infantado abandoned his base and led his troops to chinchilla de monte-aragón where he arrived on 20 january . however , the spanish guns were delayed by bad weather and swollen streams . protected by only one cavalry regiment , the artillery convoy was intercepted by digeon 's brigade at tórtola de henares on the 18th . in all , 15 artillery pieces were seized by the french dragoons . oman ( 1995 ) , pp . 13-14 after occupying cuenca , victor determined that the army of the center was out of reach . the marshal then went looking for palacios ' division at villaharta . when palacios heard of the uclés debacle , he withdrew to the sierra morena . finding that his prey escaped , victor occupied madridejos . deeming the spanish people sufficiently cowed by the victory at uclés , napoleon finally allowed his brother joseph to make a triumphal entry into his capital at madrid . the spectacle occurred on 22 january after which king joseph entered his palace . under threat , joseph 's spanish subjects swore fealty to their new king . after marching to join palacios at the despeñaperros pass , infantado was removed from command for failing to support venegas . general josé de urbina y urbina , 3rd conde de cartaojal assumed command of the army of the center . oman ( 1995 ) , p . 33 the next action was the battle of ciudad real on 27 march 1809 . smith ( 1998 ) , p . 283 . notes . references .
