history . saint-omer first appeared in the writings during the 7th century under the name of sithiu ( sithieu or sitdiu ) , around the saint-bertin abbey founded on the initiative of audomar , ( odemaars or omer ) . omer , bishop of thérouanne , in the 7th century established the abbey of saint bertin , from which that of notre-dame was an offshoot . rivalry and dissension , which lasted till the french revolution , soon sprang up between the two monastery , becoming especially virulent when in 1559 st omer became a diocese and notre-dame was raised to the rank of cathedral . in the 9th century , the village that grew up round the monasteries took the name of st omer . the normans laid the place waste about 860 and 880 . ten years later the town and monastery had built fortified walls and were safe from their attack . situated on the borders of territories frequently disputed by french , flemish , english and spain , st omer for most of its history continued to be subject to sieges and military invasions . in 932 arnulf of flanders conquered the county of artois and saint-omer ( sint-omaars in dutch ) became part of the county of flanders for the next three centuries . in 1071 philip i and the teenage count arnulf iii of flanders were defeated at st omer by arnulf 's uncle and former protector , robert the frisian , who subsequently became the count of flanders until his death in 1093 . along with its textile industry , st-omer flourished in the 12th and 13th century . in 1127 the town received a communal charter from the count , william clito , becoming the first town in west flanders with city rights . later on the city lost its leading position in the textile industry to brugge . after the mysterious death of count baldwin i , the county of flanders was weakened . in 1214 philip ii of france captured baldwin 's daughter joan and her husband ferdinand , count of flanders and forced them to sign the treaty of pont-à-vendin , in which artois was yielded to france . ferdinand did not take this lying down , and allied with emperor otto iv and john , king of england , he battled philip ii at bouvines , but was defeated . despite the political separation
