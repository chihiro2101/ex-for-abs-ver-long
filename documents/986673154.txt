Environmental full-cost accounting

concepts . full-cost accounting embodies several key concepts that distinguish it from standard accounting techniques . the following list highlights the basic tenets of fca . accounting for : costs rather than outlays ( see explanation below ) ; hidden costs and externalities ; overhead and indirect costs ; past and future outlays ; costs according to lifecycle of the product . costs rather than outlays . expenditure of cash to acquire or use a resource . a cost is the cash value of the resource as it is used . for example , an outlay is made when a vehicle is purchased , but the cost of the vehicle is incurred over its active life ( e.g . , ten years ) . the cost of the vehicle must be allocated over a period of time because every year of its use contributes to the depreciation of the vehicle 's value . hidden costs . the value of goods and services is reflected as a cost even if no cash outlay is involved . one community might receive a grant from a state , for example , to purchase equipment . this equipment has value , even though the community did not pay for it in cash . the equipment , therefore , should be valued in an fca analysis . government subsidies in the energy and food production industries keep true costs low through artificially cheap product pricing . this price manipulation encourages unsustainable practices and further hides negative externalities endemic to fossil fuel production and modern mechanized agriculture . overhead and indirect costs . fca accounts for all overhead and indirect costs , including those that are shared with other public agencies . overhead and indirect costs might include legal services , administrative support , data processing , billing , and purchasing . environmental costs as indirect costs include the full range of costs throughout the life-cycle of a product ( life cycle assessment ) , some of which even do not show up in the firm 's bottom line . schaltegger , s . & burritt , r .

identify the costs of msw management : when municipalities handle msw services through general tax funds , the costs of msw management can get lost among other expenditures . with fca , managers can have more control over msw costs because they know what the costs are . ; see through the peaks and valleys in msw cash expenditures : using techniques such as depreciation and amortization , fca produces a more accurate picture of the costs of msw programs , without the distortions that can result from focusing solely on a given year 's cash expenditures . ; explain msw costs to citizens more clearly : fca helps you collect and compile the information needed to explain to citizens what solid waste management actually costs . although some people might think that solid waste management is free ( because they are not billed specifically for msw services ) , others might overestimate its cost . fca can result in '' bottom line '' numbers that speak directly to residents . in addition , public officials can use fca results to respond to specific public concerns . ; adopt a business-like approach to msw management : by focusing attention on costs , fca fosters a more businesslike approach to msw management . consumers of goods and services increasingly expect value , which means an appropriate balance between quality and cost of service . fca can help identify opportunities for streamlining services , eliminating inefficiencies , and facilitating cost-saving efforts through informed planning and decision-making . ; develop a stronger position in negotiating with vendors : when considering privatization of msw services , solid waste managers can use fca to learn what it costs ( or would cost ) to do the work . as a result , fca better positions public agencies for negotiations and decision-making . fca also can help communities with publicly run operations determine whether their costs are competitive with the private sector . ; evaluate the appropriate mix of msw services : fca gives managers the ability to evaluate the cost of each element of their solid waste system , such as recycling , composting , waste-to-energy , and landfilling . fca can help managers avoid common mistakes in thinking about solid waste management , notably the error of treating avoided costs as revenues . ; fine-tune msw programs : as more communities use fca and report the results , managers might be able to '' benchmark '' their operations to similar communities or norms . this comparison can suggest options for '' re-engineering '' current operations . furthermore , when cities , counties , and towns know what it costs to manage msw independently , they can better identify any savings that might come from working together . food and agriculture . over the last ten years there has been considerable attention for full cost accounting ( fca ) or true cost accounting ( tca ) in the field of food and agriculture . in 2013 and 2016 , the sustainable food trust organised two conferences on true cost accounting in food and farming , in the uk and the usa respectively . true cost accounting , sustainablefoodtrust.org , sustainable food trust , accessed 20.06.20 . the fao published two studies in 2014 and 2015 with a tca-analysis of the impact of food wastage ( '' food wastage footprint : full cost accounting '' food wastage footprint , www.fao.org , fao , accessed 12.06.20 . ) and another tca-analysis of the total impact of world food production on natural capital ( '' natural capital impacts in agriculture '' natural capital impacts in agriculture , www.fao.org , fao , accessed 20.06.20 . ) . in the first report , the fao comes to the conclusion that the yearly hidden impact of food wastage on natural capital amounts to usd 700 billion while the hidden impact on social capital amounts to usd 900 billion dollars . in the second report , the fao estimates the environmental damage of the world food production at usd 2330 billion per year . motives for adoption . various motives for adoption of fca/tca have been identified . the most significant of which tend to involve anticipating market or regulatory problems associated with ignoring the comprehensive outcome of the whole process or event accounted for . in green economics , this is the major concern and basis for critiques of such measures as gdp . the public sector has tended to move more towards longer term measures to avoid accusations of political favoritism towards specific solutions that seem to make financial or economic sense in the short term , but not longer term . corporate decision makers sometimes call on fca/tca measures to decide whether to initiate recalls , practice voluntary product stewardship ( a form of recall at the end of a product 's useful life ) . this can be motivated as a hedge against future liabilities arising from those who are negatively affected by the waste a product becomes . advanced theories of fca , such as natural step , focus firmly on these . according to ray anderson , who instituted a form of fca/tca at interface carpet , used it to rule out decisions that increase ecological footprint and focus the company more clearly on a sustainable marketing strategy . the urban ecology and industrial ecology approaches inherently advocate fca & nbsp ; â€” treating the built environment as a sort of ecosystem to minimize its own wastes .
