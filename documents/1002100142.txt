Jean Genet

biography . early life . genet 's mother was a prostitute who raised him for the first seven months of his life before placing him for adoption . thereafter genet was raised in the provincial town of alligny-en-morvan , in the nièvre department of central france . his foster family was headed by a carpenter and , according to edmund white 's biography , was loving and attentive . while he received excellent grades in school , his childhood involved a series of attempts at running away and incidents of petty theft . after the death of his foster mother , genet was placed with an elderly couple but remained with them less than two years . according to the wife , '' he was going out nights and also seemed to be wearing makeup . '' on one occasion he squandered a considerable sum of money , which they had entrusted him for delivery elsewhere , on a visit to a local fair . detention and military service . for this and other misdemeanors , including repeated acts of vagrancy , he was sent at the age of 15 to mettray penal colony where he was detained between 2 september 1926 and 1 march 1929 . in miracle of the rose ( 1946 ) , he gives an account of this period of detention , which ended at the age of 18 when he joined the foreign legion . he was eventually given a dishonorable discharge on grounds of indecency ( having been caught engaged in a homosexual act ) and spent a period as a vagabond , petty thief and prostitute across europe—experiences he recounts in the thief 's journal ( 1949 ) . criminal career , prison , and prison writings . after returning to paris , france in 1937 , genet was in and out of prison through a series of arrests for theft , use of false papers , vagabondage , lewd acts , and other offences . in prison , genet wrote his first poem , '' le condamné à mort '' , which he had printed at his own cost , and the novel our lady of the flowers ( 1944 ) . in paris , genet sought out and introduced himself to jean cocteau , who was impressed by his writing . cocteau used his contacts to get genet 's novel published , and in 1949 , when genet was threatened with a life sentence after ten convictions , cocteau and other prominent figures , including jean-paul sartre and pablo picasso , successfully petitioned the french president to have the sentence set aside . genet would never return to prison . writing and activism . by 1949 , genet had completed five novels , three plays , and numerous poems , many controversial for their explicit and often deliberately provocative portrayal of homosexuality and criminality . sartre wrote a long analysis of genet 's existential development ( from vagrant to writer ) , entitled saint genet ( 1952 ) , which was anonymously published as the first volume of genet 's complete works . genet was strongly affected by sartre 's analysis and did not write for the next five years . between 1955 and 1961 , genet wrote three more plays as well as an essay called '' what remains of a rembrandt torn into four equal pieces and flushed down the toilet '' , on which hinged jacques derrida 's analysis of genet in his seminal work glas . during this time , genet became emotionally attached to abdallah bentaga , a tightrope walker . however , following a number of accidents and his suicide in 1964 , genet entered a period of depression , and even attempted suicide himself . brian gordon kennelly , unfinished business : tracing incompletion in jean genet 's posthumously published plays ( rodopi , 1997 ) p22 from the late 1960s , starting with an homage to daniel cohn-bendit after the events of may 1968 , genet became politically active . he participated in demonstrations drawing attention to the living conditions of immigrants in france . genet was censored in the united states in 1968 and later expelled when they refused him a visa . in an interview with edward de grazia , professor of law and first amendment lawyer , genet discusses the time he went through canada for the chicago congress . he entered without a visa and left with no issues . in 1970 , the black panthers invited him to the united states , where he stayed for three months giving lectures , attended the trial of their leader , huey newton , and published articles in their journals . later the same year he spent six months in palestinian refugee camps , secretly meeting yasser arafat near amman . profoundly moved by his experiences in the united states and jordan , genet wrote a final lengthy memoir about his experiences , prisoner of love , which would be published posthumously . genet also supported angela davis and george jackson , as well as michel foucault and daniel defert 's prison information group . he worked with foucault and sartre to protest police brutality against algerians in paris , a problem persisting since the algerian war of independence , when beaten bodies were to be found floating in the seine . genet expresses his solidarity with the red army faction ( raf ) of andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , in the article '' violence et brutalité '' , published in le monde , 1977 . in september 1982 , genet was in beirut when the massacres took place in the palestinian camps of sabra and shatila . in response , genet published '' quatre heures à chatila '' ( '' four hours in shatila '' ) , an account of his visit to shatila after the event . in one of his rare public appearances during the later period of his life , at the invitation of austrian philosopher hans köchler , he read from his work during the inauguration of an exhibition on the massacre of sabra and shatila organized by the international progress organization in vienna , austria , on 19 december 1983 . . death . genet developed throat cancer and was found dead at jack 's hotel in paris on 15 april 1986 where his photograph and books remain . genet may have fallen on the floor and fatally hit his head . he is buried in the larache christian cemetery in larache , morocco . . genet 's works . novels and autobiography . throughout his five early novels , genet works to subvert the traditional set of morality of his assumed readership . he celebrates a beauty in evil , emphasizes his singularity , raises violent criminals to icons , and enjoys the specificity of gay gesture and coding and the depiction of scenes of betrayal . our lady of the flowers ( notre dame des fleurs 1943 ) is a journey through the prison underworld , featuring a fictionalized alter-ego named divine , usually referred to in the feminine . divine is surrounded by tantes ( '' aunties '' or '' queens '' ) with colorful sobriquets such as mimosa i , mimosa ii , first communion and the queen of rumania . the two auto-fictional novels miracle of the rose ( miracle de la rose 1946 ) and the thief 's journal ( journal du voleur 1949 ) describe genet 's time in mettray penal colony and his experiences as a vagabond and prostitute across europe . querelle de brest ( 1947 ) is set in the port town of brest , where sailors and the sea are associated with murder . funeral rites ( 1949 ) is a story of love and betrayal across political divides , written for the narrator 's lover , jean decarnin , killed by the germany in wwii . prisoner of love , published in 1986 after genet 's death , is a memoir of his encounters with palestinian fighters and black panthers . it has a more documentary tone than his fiction . art criticism . genet wrote an essay on the work of the swiss sculptor and artist alberto giacometti titled l'atelier d'alberto giacometti . it was highly praised by major artists , including giacometti and picasso . genet wrote in an informal style , incorporating excerpts of conversations between himself and giacometti . genet 's biographer edmund white said that , rather than write in the style of an art historian , genet '' invented a whole new language for discussing '' giacometti , proposing '' that the statues of giacometti should be offered to the dead , and that they should be buried . '' kirili , alain . '' edmund white '' . bomb magazine . spring 1994 . retrieved 25 july 2011 . . plays . genet 's plays present highly stylized depictions of ritualistic struggles between outcasts of various kinds and their oppressors . see martin esslin 's book for one perspective on genet 's relationship both to artaud 's 'theatre of cruelty ' and to esslin 's own theatre of the absurd . not all critics agree that artaud is genet 's most significant influence ; both bertolt brecht and luigi pirandello have also been identified . social identities are parodied and shown to involve complex layering through manipulation of the dramatic fiction and its inherent potential for theatricality and role-play ; maids mimesis one another and their mistress in the maids ( 1947 ) ; or the clients of a brothel simulate roles of political power before , in a dramatic reversal , actually becoming those figures , all surrounded by mirrors that both reflect and conceal , in the balcony ( 1957 ) . most strikingly , genet offers a critical dramatisation of what aimé césaire called negritude in the blacks ( 1959 ) , presenting a violent assertion of black identity and anti-white virulence framed in terms of mask-wearing and roles adopted and discarded . his most overtly political play is the screens ( 1964 ) , an epic account of the algerian war . he also wrote another full-length drama , splendid 's , in 1948 and a one-act play , her ( elle ) , in 1955 , though neither was published or produced during genet 's lifetime . the blacks was , after the balcony , the second of genet 's plays to be staged in new york . the production was the longest running off-broadway non-musical of the decade . originally premiered in paris in 1959 , this 1961 new york production ran for 1,408 performances . the original cast featured james earl jones , roscoe lee browne , louis gossett , jr . , cicely tyson , godfrey cambridge , maya angelou and charles gordone . film . in 1950 , genet directed un chant d'amour , a 26-minute black-and-white film depicting the fantasies of a gay male prisoner and his prison warden . genet is also credited as co-director of the west german television documentary am anfang war der dieb ( 1984 ) , along with his co-stars hans neuenfels and françois bondy . genet 's work has been adapted for film and produced by other filmmakers . in 1982 , rainer werner fassbinder released querelle , his final film , based on querelle of brest . it starred brad davis , jeanne moreau and franco nero . tony richardson directed mademoiselle , which was based on a short story by genet . it starred jeanne moreau with the screenplay written by marguerite duras . todd haynes ' poison was based on the writings of genet . several of genet 's plays were adapted into films . the balcony ( 1963 ) , directed by joseph strick , starred shelley winters as madame irma , peter falk , lee grant and leonard nimoy . the maids was filmed in 1974 and starred glenda jackson , susannah york and vivien merchant . italian director salvatore samperi in 1986 directed another adaptation for film of the same play , la bonne ( eng . corruption ) , starring florence guerin and katrine michelsen . legacy . jean genet made an unlikely appearance by proxy in the pop charts when david bowie released his 1972 hit single '' the jean genie '' . in his 2005 book moonage daydream , bowie confirmed that the title '' . was a clumsy pun upon jean genet '' . david bowie & mick rock ( 2005 ) . moonage daydream : pp . 140–146 a later promo video combines a version of the song with a fast edit of genet 's 1950 movie a song of love . '' les boys '' from dire straits ' 1980 album making movies contains a reference to genet . genet is mentioned twice in the lyrics to the song '' a cocaine christmas and an alcoholic 's new year '' by the english band money on its 2016 studio album suicide songs . jean genet is also referenced in the 2000 film wonder boys in a scene with michael douglas and robert downey jr . list of works . novels and autobiography . entries show : english-language translation of title ( french-language title ) year written / year first published our lady of the flowers ( notre dame des fleurs ) 1942/1943 miracle of the rose ( miracle de la rose ) 1946/1951 funeral rites ( pompes funèbres ) 1947/1953 querelle of brest ( querelle de brest ) 1947/1953 the thief 's journal ( journal du voleur ) 1949/1949 prisoner of love ( un captif amoureux ) 1986/1986 . drama . entries show : english-language translation of title ( french-language title ) year written / year first published / year first performed ′adame miroir ( ballet ) ( 1944 ) . in fragments et autres textes , 1990 ( fragments of the artwork , 2003 ) deathwatch ( haute surveillance ) 1944/1949/1949 the maids ( les bonnes ) 1946/1947/1947 splendid 's 1948/1993/ the balcony ( le balcon ) 1955/1956/1957 . complementary texts '' how to perform the balcony '' and '' note '' published in 1962 . the blacks ( les nègres ) 1955/1958/1959 ( preface first published in theatre complet , gallimard , 2002 ) her ( elle ) 1955/1989 the screens ( les paravents ) 1956-61/1961/1964 le bagne french edition only ( 1994 ) spitzer , mark , trans . 2010 . the genet translations : poetry and posthumous plays . polemic press . see www.sptzr.net/genet_translations.htm . . cinema . un chant d'amour ( 1950 ) haute surveillance ( 1944 ) was used as the basis for the 1965 american adaptation deathwatch , directed by vic morrow . les rêves interdits , ou l'autre versant du rêve ( forbidden dreams or the other side of dreams ) ( 1952 ) was used as the basis for the script for tony richardson 's film mademoiselle , made in 1966 . le bagne ( the penal colony ) . written in the 1950s . excerpt published in the selected writings of jean genet , the ecco press ( 1993 ) . la nuit venue/le bleu de l'oeil ( the night has come/the blue of the eye ) ( 1976–78 ) . excerpts published in les nègres au port de la lune , paris : editions de la différence ( 1988 ) , and in the cinema of jean genet , bfi publishing ( 1991 ) .
