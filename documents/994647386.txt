Hermann Sudermann

life . early career . he was born at matzicken , a village to the east of heydekrug in the province of prussia ( now macikai and šilutė , in southwestern lithuania ) , close to the russian frontier . the sudermanns were a mennonite family long settled near the former elbing , east prussia , ( now elbląg ) , poland ) . his father owned a small brewery in heydekrug , and sudermann received his early education at the realschule in elbing , but , his parents having been reduced in circumstances , he was apprenticed to a chemist at the age of 14 . he was , however , able to enter the realgymnasium ( high school ) in tilsit , and to study philosophy and history at königsberg university . in order to complete his studies sudermann went to berlin , where he was tutor to several families , including the family of the author hans hopfen ( 1835–1904 ) . next he became a journalist , and was in 1881 and 1882 the co-editor of the deutsches reichsblatt . he then devoted himself to fiction , beginning with a collection of naturalistic short stories called im zwielicht ( '' at twilight '' , 1886 ) , and the novels frau sorge ( '' dame care '' , 1887 ) , geschwister ( '' siblings '' , 1888 ) and der katzensteg ( '' cats ' bridge '' , 1890 ) . these works failed to bring the young author as much recognition as his first drama , die ehre ( '' honour '' , 1889 ) , which inaugurated a new period in the history of the german stage . this play , originally intended to be a tragedy , but on blumenthal 's advice given a '' happy ending , '' was a pseudo-nietzschean attack on the morality of the lowly . he married the novelist clara lauckner ( 1861–1924 ) , née schulz on 20 october 1891 and lived with his family in berlin-wannsee . she was a widow and already had three children from her previous short-lived marriage , and she would have one child with sudermann : a daughter , hede . they lived in königsberg for the next two years , before moving to dresden and then berlin in 1895 . fame . heimat ( 1893 ) , another successful drama , was translated into english as magda ( 1896 ) . in this play , sudermann emphasizes the right of the artist to a freer moral life than that of the petty bourgeoisie . it has some of the moralistic and didactic tendency of the later french dramatists , especially the dumas fils , and all of their technical finesse . productions featured some of the best known actresses of the time , including helena modjeska , sarah bernhardt , eleonora duse , and mrs patrick campbell . he had a large following in japan . during the 20th century , his plays were the basis of more than 30 films . sudermann returned to novels with es war ( '' it was '' , 1894 , the title referring to section 2 , §1 of nietzsche 's unzeitgemässe betrachtungen ) , a protest against the fruitlessness of brooding repentance . in 1902 , he moved to a mansion with extensive grounds at blankensee , and used his new-found wealth to collect paintings and sculpture , and to take trips to italy , greece , egypt and india . at the commencement of world war i , sudermann was enthusiastic , publishing a kaiserlied ( '' song of the kaiser '' ) . in autumn 1917 , he organised the frohe abende ( '' cheery evenings '' ) , a program promoting artistic endeavors among the common people , for which he received an iron cross second class on 5 april 1918 . after the end of the war , he helped found the bund schaffender künstler ( '' society of creative artists '' ) , which posed as a centrist political force and which earned him the reputation of an opportunist . the most important of his later works are litauische geschichten ( '' lithuanian stories '' , 1917 , translated as the excursion to tilsit ) , a realistic portrait of his homeland , and a volume of memoirs in 1922 . his last major work , written after the death of his wife in 1924 , was die frau des steffen tromholt ( '' the wife of steffen tromholt '' , 1927 ) , a semi-autobiographical novel , which turned into a movie in 1929 titled wonder of women . he had a stroke in 1928 , and died of a lung infection shortly afterwards , in berlin , aged 71 . his stepson rolf lauckner set up the hermann sudermann foundation to support young dramatists . posthumous reputation . sudermann 's nationalism , and his delight in romanticized ideas of ethnicity and homeland , particularly noticeable in his later works , made him a favorite during world war ii . jürgen fehling staged johannisfeuer in berlin , with maria gorvin , maria koppenhöfer and paul wegener in the lead roles . the film die reise nach tilsit was based on his short story of the same title . cinzia romani , tainted goddesses : female film stars of the third reich p . 86 after 1945 , his plays and novels were almost completely forgotten . he mainly is remembered today for his lithuanian stories , for his autobiography , and for the 1927 silent films sunrise , based on his short story die reise nach tilsit ( '' the excursion to tilsit '' ) , from the collection litauische geschichten ( lithuanian stories ) , the song of songs , starring marlene dietrich , based on his novel das hohe lied and flesh and the devil , starring
