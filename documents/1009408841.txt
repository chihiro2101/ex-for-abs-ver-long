'' although the neighboring states of arkansas , louisiana , and missouri would also produce boogie-woogie players and their boogie-woogie tunes , and despite the fact that chicago would become known as the center for this music through such pianists as jimmy yancey , albert ammons , and meade lux lewis , texas was home to an environment that fostered creation of boogie-style : the lumber , cattle , turpentine , and oil industries , all served by an expanding railway system from the northern corner of east texas to the gulf coast and from the louisiana border to dallas and west texas . '' david oliphant , texan jazz , university of texas press , 1996 , p . 75 . alan lomax wrote : '' anonymous black musicians , longing to grab a train and ride away from their troubles , incorporated the rhythms of the steam locomotive and the moan of their whistles into the new dance music they were playing in jukes and dance halls . boogie-woogie forever changed piano playing , as ham-handed black piano players transformed the instrument into a polyrhythmic railroad train . '' alan lomax , chapter 4 , lonesome whistles , p . 170 , the land where the blues began , new york , ny : the new press , 1993 . in the 1986 television broadcast of britain 's the south bank show about boogie-woogie , music historian paul oliver noted : '' now the conductors were used to the logging camp pianists clamoring aboard , telling them a few stories , jumping off the train , getting into another logging camp , and playing again for eight hours , barrel house . in this way the music got around—all through texas—and eventually , of course , out of texas . now when this new form of piano music came from texas , it moved out towards louisiana . it was brought by people like george w . thomas , an early pianist who was already living in new orleans by about 1910 and writing '' new orleans hop scop blues '' , which really has some of the characteristics of the music that we came to know as boogie . '' paul oliver also wrote that george w . thomas '' composed the theme of the new orleans hop scop blues – in spite of its title – based on the blues he had heard played by the pianists of east texas . '' oliver , paul , the story of the blues , london , 1969 , p . 85 . on february 12 , 2007 , oliver confirmed to john tennison that it was sippie wallace who told oliver that performances by east texas pianists had formed the basis for george thomas 's '' hop scop blues '' . interview with paul oliver by john tennison , february 12 , 2007 . george thomas and his brother hersal thomas migrated from texas to chicago , and brought boogie-woogie with them . they were an immense influence on other pianists , including jimmy yancey , meade lux lewis , albert ammons and many others . many elements that we now know as elements of boogie-woogie are present in hersal and george thomas ' '' the fives '' . according to tennison , '' although some boogie woogie bass figures were present in prior sheet music , the thing that made 'the fives ' so special was the greater amount and variety of boogie woogie bass figures that were present in the music as compared to boogie woogie bass figures that had been present in previously published sheet music , such as the 1915 '' weary blues '' by artie matthews . '' albert ammons and meade 'lux ' lewis claim that 'the fives , ' copyrighted in 1921 and published in 1922 the thomas brothers ' musical composition , deserves much credit for the development of modern boogie-woogie . during the 1920s , many pianists featured this number as a 'get off ' tune and in the variations played what is now considered boogie-woogie .

'' on may 13 , 2010 , the marshall city commission enacted an official declaration naming marshall as the '' birthplace '' of boogie-woogie music , and embarked on a program to encourage additional historical research and to stimulate interest in and appreciation for the early african-american culture in northeast texas that played a vital role in creating boogie-woogie music . lee hancock , dallas morning news , june 18 , 2010 . the city of marshall , texas is committed to cooperating with any and all efforts to unearth boogie-woogie history and to honor , celebrate , and re-create the vibrant environment that was catalytic to the creation of the most entertaining , revolutionary , and influential of all american musical forms .
