( it was at this time that private eye started referring to him as the penguin , a nickname he had first acquired in 1966 . ) levy further criticised keene for selling three of his own companies to brain games network plc ( bgn ) for £220,000 despite their being '' virtually worthless '' . the three companies had between them '' a total capital and reserves of only £2,300 '' . at much the same time , according to levy , bgn purchased a web site and two domain names from chess and bridge limited . however , they made the purchase in two stages . the first of these stages was its sale to giloberg finance limited , owned by keene 's associate alan lubin : the second was the immediate sale of the same items , by giloberg , to bgn . the first sale was for approximately £60,000 ( in fact 100,000 ) and the second was for £290,000 , hence making giloberg '' an instant profit of approximately £230,000 '' and raising the question of why bgn should have paid a sum much greater than the original vendors considered the items were worth . is fraud a brain game ? by david levy , 6 january 2002 . bgn collapsed in controversial circumstances . shareholders were unhappy that sums amounting to at least £675,000 had been paid to directors in '' fees and payments '' despite the company swiftly becoming insolvent . private eye , 1084 , 11 july 2003 . investors were also unhappy that keene and lubin had acquired 88 % of the company '' for a song '' even though the remaining 12 % had been sold for around £3 million . private eye , 1093 , 14 november 2003 . during the course of the 2000 braingames world championship keene was accused of heavy-handed behaviour in having journalist john henderson removed from the press room with the assistance of bouncers .

'' '' keene 's gambit '' by nick pitt , sunday times magazine 13 january 1991 , p . 20 . attempts to defend keene were rebutted by michael stean 's mother , who stated that she was in a position to know what was in keene 's contract since she herself had typed it . keene , she claimed , had signed this despite having already negotiated a contract with batsford to write a book about the match . she described '' a premeditated and deliberate plan to deceive '' and noted that keene 's conduct had come under suspicion during the match . '' when keene was taxed by petra leeuwerik and viktor korchnoi as to whether he was writing a book during the match , as he was spending so much of his time in the press office sending telex messages , keene emphatically denied it .
