Shopping cart

design . thumb most modern shopping carts are made of metal or a combination of metal and plastic and have been designed to nest within each other in a line to facilitate collecting and moving many at one time and also to save on storage space . the carts can come in many sizes , with larger ones able to carry a child . there are also specialized carts designed for two children , and electric mobility scooters with baskets designed for individuals with disabilities . in the united states , 24,000 children are injured each year in shopping carts . some stores both in the u.s . and internationally have child carrying carts that look like a car or van with a seat where a child can sit equipped with a steering wheel and sometimes a horn . such '' car-carts '' may offer protection and convenience by keeping the child restrained , lower to the ground , protected from falling items , and amused . shopping carts are usually fitted with four wheels , however if any one wheel jams the cart can become difficult to handle . most carts in the united states have caster at the front , while the rear wheels are fixed in orientation , while in europe it is more common to have four swivel wheels . this difference in design correlates with smaller retail premises in europe . the front part of the cart is often sectioned off in order to place household goods such as bleach , cleaning products etc . so that they do not mix with edible products . an alternative to the shopping cart is a small hand-held shopping basket . a customer may prefer a basket for a small amount of merchandise . small shops , where carts would be impractical , often supply only baskets , or may offer a small cart which uses an inserted shopping basket within the frame of the cart to provide either choice to a customer . history . development of first shopping cart by sylvan goldman . one of the first shopping carts was introduced on june 4 , 1937 , the invention of sylvan goldman , owner of the humpty dumpty supermarket chain in oklahoma . one night , in 1936 , goldman sat in his office wondering how customers might move more groceries . he found a wooden folding chair and put a basket on the seat and wheels on the legs . goldman and one of his employees , a mechanic named fred young , began tinkering . their first shopping cart was a metal frame that held two wire baskets . since they were inspired by the folding chair , goldman called his carts '' folding basket carriers '' . another mechanic , arthur kosted , developed a method to mass-produce the carts by inventing an assembly line capable of forming and welding the wire . the cart was awarded patent number 2,196,914 on april 9 , 1940 ( filing date : march 14 , 1938 ) , titled , '' folding basket carriage for self-service stores '' . they advertised the invention as part of a new “ no basket carrying plan . '' goldman had already pioneered self-serve stores and carts were part of the self-serve retail concept . the invention did not catch on immediately . men found them effeminate ; women found them suggestive of a baby carriage . '' i 've pushed my last baby , '' an offended woman informed goldman . after hiring several male and female models to push his new invention around his store and demonstrate their utility , as well as greeters to explain their use , shopping carts became extremely popular and goldman became a multimillionaire . in urban areas like new york city , where transporting groceries home from the store 's parking lot is more likely to involve walking and/or a trip by public transportation than a car ride , privately owned carts resembling goldman 's design are still popular . instead of baskets , these carts are built to hold the paper bags dispensed by the grocery store . another shopping cart innovator was orla watson , orla watson invented the grocery cart with a basket . november 16 , 2003 . american profile . who invented the swinging rear door to allow for '' nesting '' in 1946 . terry p . wilson , the cart that changed the world : the career of sylvan n . goldman ( university of oklahoma press , 1978 ) . catherine grandclément , '' wheeling one 's groceries around the store : the invention of the shopping cart , 1936-1953 '' , in warren belasco and roger horowitz ( eds . ) , food chains : from farmyard to shopping cart ( university of pennsylvania press , 2008 ) , pp . 233-251 . ted morgan , on becoming american : a celebration of what it means and how it feels ( boston : houghton mifflin , 1978 , pp . 45-6 ) . goldman continued to make modifications to his original design , but advice from his trusted business partners fred taylor , a grocery store owner , and george o'donnell , a grocery store refrigeration salesman , and the incorporation of watson 's swinging door yielded the familiar nesting cart that we see today ( albeit the original telescope cart had two baskets rather than one ) . smithsonian snapshot : telescoping shopping cart , c . 1949 . newswise.com . goldman patented a similar version of the cart which he called the '' nest-kart '' in 1948 , over one year after watson filed for his patent . catherine grandclément ( 2006 ) . wheeling food products around the store… and away : the invention of the shopping cart , 1936-1953 . csi working papers series . the nest-kart incorporated the same nesting mechanism present on the shopping carts designed by watson , and an interference investigation was ordered by telescope carts , inc . alleging infringement of the patent in 1948 . after a protracted legal battle , goldman ultimately recognized watson 's invention and paid one dollar in damages for counterfeit , in exchange for which watson granted goldman an exclusive operating license ( apart from the three licenses that had already been granted ) . in 1909 , bessie decamp invented a seat belt for chairs , go-carts or carriages . child's-chair safety device - bessie decamp - patent 944,020 this was well before shopping carts with child seating areas were invented . goldman introduced a child seating area on shopping carts in 1947 . for whatever reason , it was n't until 1967 that seat belts for shopping carts were introduced by david allen . it was high tech for the time , because it was a retractable seat belt . safety retaining belt for shopping carts – david l . allen – patent 3,550,136 . development of nesting carts by orla watson . image : shopping cart shepherd for target jeh.jpg thumb right 200px nested carts being returned from a parking lot to a target store by a cart pushing assist device in 1946 , orla watson devised a system for a telescoping ( i.e . , '' nesting '' ) shopping cart which did not require assembly or disassembly of its parts before and after use like goldman 's cart ; goldman 's design up until this point required that the cart be unfolded much like a folding chair . this cart could be fitted into another cart for compact storage via a swinging one-way rear door . the swinging rear door formed the basis of the patent claim , and was a major innovation in the evolution of the modern shopping cart . watson applied for a patent on his shopping cart invention in 1946 , but goldman contested it and filed an application for a similar patent with the swinging door feature on a shopping cart with only one basket in 1948 which goldman named the '' nest-kart '' . after considerable litigation and allegations of patent infringement , goldman relinquished his rights to the patent in 1949 to watson and his company , telescope carts , inc . realizing that the swinging rear door feature was the key to watson 's patent . watson was awarded patent 2,479,530 on august 16 , 1949 . in exchange , goldman was granted an exclusive licensing right in addition to the three other licenses previously granted ; telescope carts , inc . continued to receive royalties for each cart produced by goldman 's company that incorporated the '' nesting '' design . this included any shopping cart utilizing his hinged rear door , including the familiar single basket '' nesting '' designs similar to those used in the present . owing to its overwhelming success , many different manufacturers desired to produce shopping carts with the rear swinging door feature but were denied due to the exclusive license issued to goldman . the federal government filed a lawsuit against telescope carts , inc . in 1950 alleging the exclusive license granted to goldman was invalid , and a consent decree was entered into where telescope carts , inc . agreed to offer the same license to any manufacturer . orla watson and telescope carts , inc . licensed their telescoping shopping cart design to several manufacturers throughout the 1950s and 1960s until the patent expired . new developments . in 2012 , a driverless shopping cart was made by chaotic moon labs . the device , called '' project sk8 '' or '' smarter cart '' was basically a cart fitted with windows kinect ( to detect obstacles ) , and an electric drivetrain , and used in conjunction with a windows 8 tablet . for smaller stores , shopping baskets with wheels can be used either as a large basket or a small cart . these carts are designed for indoor use only . retail store acceptance . past studies determined that retailers who did not offer shopping carts such as sears suffered lower sales in comparison to retailers who did use shopping carts . assortment ( referencing a study by britt beamer of america 's research group ) influence of the shopping cart , retrieved on may 23 , 2011 . subsequent to the introduction of shopping carts and centralized checkout lines at sears stores , the company noticed a correlating increase in sales . dr . steve vitucci , texas a & m university & nbsp ; – central texas sears update case notes , retrieved on may 23 , 2011 . in 2004 british supermarket chain tesco trialed shopping carts with user-adjustable wheel resistance , heart rate monitoring and calorie counting hardware in an effort to raise awareness of health issues . the cart 's introduction coincided with tesco 's sponsorship of the cancer awareness race for life . also in 2004 , shopping carts were identified as a source of pathogens and became a major public health concern . this was primarily due to the media spotlight on a japanese research study revealing large amounts of bacteria on shopping carts . african journal of microbiology research vol . 5 ( 23 ) , pp . 3998-4003 , october 23 , 2011 those findings were later backed by a university of arizona study in 2007 . vincent sobotka ( march 14 , 2011 . ) study : e.coli contamination found on half of shopping carts . digital journal . in 2009 researchers developed prototypes of computerized context aware shopping carts by attaching tablet computers to ordinary carts . initial field trials showed that the prototype 's context awareness provided an opportunity for enhancing and altering the shopping experience . black , d . , clemmensen , n . j . , and skov , m . b . ( 2009 ) shopping in the real world : interacting with a context-aware shopping trolley , proc . of mobile interaction with the real world . shopping in the real world : interacting with a context-aware shopping trolley some retailers , such as target , have begun using carts fully made of recycled plastic with the only metal part being the wheel axles , drawing away from the established metal cart design . target 's cart has won design awards for its improved casters , interchangeable plastic parts to simplify repairs , and handles that improve maneuverability . other cart designs also incorporate additional features such as a cup holder for cold or hot drinks or a bouquet of flowers , along with other features such as a secure shelf for a tablet computer or mobile phone to allow the use of mobile coupons and circulars , or as seen in an all-plastic design created for the wisconsin-based festival foods and also used by whole foods market by bemis manufacturing company , all of these features , along with extra rungs on the side rail designed to attach plastic bags or carry handles for beverages . smaller half-sized carts for smaller shopping trips have also become common . . deposits . in many countries , the customer has to pay a small deposit by inserting a coin , token or card , which is returned if and when the customer returns the cart to a designated cart parking point . the system works through a lock mounted on the handle of the cart , connecting it to a chain mounted on the cart in front of it when nested together , or to a chain mounted on a cart collection corral . inserting the token unlocks the chain , and reinserting the chain locks it in place and ejects the token for user to retrieve . one motivation behind the deposit system is to reduce the expense of employees having to gather carts that are not returned , and to avoid damage done by runaway carts . another benefit is that carts are less likely to be removed from the store premises and abandoned in the surrounding neighborhood . carts that are not returned may be returned voluntarily by a pedestrian , with the deposit coin acting as a reward . although almost ubiquitous in continental europe and the uk , the deposit system is less common in canada and has not been widely adopted in the united states , with the exception of some chains like aldi , which require a 0.25 deposit . one of the first store chains to use the 0.25 deposit system in the us was the real superstore ( a subsidiary of national supermarkets ) in the early 1990s national supermarkets . other stores such as costco and shoprite also use the coin deposit system , but it is not used at all of their locations . in australia , deposit systems are common in some local government areas , as they have been made compulsory by local law . usually , all aldi stores , and most coles and woolworths stores will have a lock mechanism on their carts that requires a 1 or 2 coin to unlock . the deposit varies , but usually coins of higher value , such as €1 , £1 , or 1 are used . while the deposit systems usually are designed to accommodate a certain size of domestic coin , foreign coins , former currencies ( like german d-marks ) , or even appropriately folded pieces of cardboard can be used to unlock the carts as well . cart collectors are also usually provided with a special key that they can use to unlock the carts from the cart bay and get the key back . some retailers sell '' tokens '' as an alternative to coins , often for charity . merchandising companies also offer branded shopping tokens as a product . theft prevention . shopping cart theft can be a costly problem with stores that use them . the carts , which typically cost between 75 and 150 each , with some models costing 300–400 , are removed by people for various purposes . to prevent theft , estimated at 800 million worldwide per annum , stores use various security systems as discussed below . . cart retrieval service . most retailers in north america utilize a cart retrieval service , which collects carts found off the store 's premises and returns them to the store for a fee . the primary strength of this system is the ability of pedestrian customers to take purchases home and allow retailers to recapture abandoned carts in a timely manner at a fraction of the cost of a replacement cart . it also allows retailers to maintain their cart inventories without an expensive capital outlay . a drawback of this method is that it is reactive , instead of proactively preventing the carts from leaving the store premises . . electronic and magnetic . electronic systems are sometimes used by retailers . each shopping cart is fitted with an electronic locking wheel clamp , or '' boot '' . us patent 5598144a a transmitter with a thin wire is placed around the perimeter of the parking lot , and the boot locks when the cart leaves the designated area . store personnel must then deactivate the lock with a handheld remote control to return the cart to stock . often , a line is painted in front of the broadcast range to warn customers that their cart will stop when rolled past the line . however , these systems are very expensive to install and although helpful , are not foolproof . the wheels can be lifted over the electronic barrier and/or pushed hard enough that the locks break . there are also safety concerns if the person pushing the trolley is running , and also if the trolley does n't lock and is taken onto a road , locking due to magnetic materials under the road . some cities have required retailers to install locking wheel systems on their shopping carts . in some cases , electronic systems companies have encouraged passage of such laws to create a captive audience of potential customers . . physical . a low-tech form of theft prevention utilizes a physical impediment , such as vertical posts at the store entrance to keep carts from being taken into the parking lot . this method also impedes physically disabled customers , which may be illegal in many jurisdictions . for example , in the united states it would be a violation of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 . another method is to mount a pole taller than the entrance , onto the shopping cart , so that the pole will block exit of the cart . however , this method requires that the store aisles be higher than the pole , including lights , piping , any overhead signage and fixtures . it also prevents customers from carting their purchases to their cars in the store 's carts . many customers learn to bring their own folding or otherwise collapsible cart with them , which they can usually hang on the store 's cart while shopping . a further system is to use a cattle grid style system . all pedestrian exits have specially designed flooring tiles , which , along with specially designed wheels on the cart , will immobilize the cart as they roll onto them . like the magnetic systems , this can easily be overcome by lifting the cart over the tiles . name . the names of a shopping cart vary by region . the following names are region specific names for shopping carts . many of these names may be used alone or in descriptive phrases such as grocery ____ , shopping ____ , or supermarket _____ : cart , or basket & nbsp ; – the united states , canada and the philippines buggy & nbsp ; – used by some in southeast michigan , western pennsylvania , in the southern united states and parts of canada trolley & nbsp ; – the united kingdom , ireland , australia , new zealand , malaysia , south africa and some regions of canada . was also used in the philippines . carriage & nbsp ; – used by some in the new england region of the united states . barrae or coohudder - some places in scotland . bascart & nbsp ; – various regions . wagon & nbsp ; – new york , hawaii . for people with a disability . special electronic shopping carts are provided by many retailers for the elderly or people with a disability . these are essentially electric wheelchairs with an attached basket . they allow customers to navigate around the store and collect items . manually powered carts are also available specifically designed for use by wheelchair users . a still-to-be-implemented aid for people with disabilities is the addition of a guide wheel at the center of rotation of a cart with four caster wheels . in order to allow the nesting of carts to be unhindered , this guide wheel is attached to the front of the cart with a piece of spring steel which bends under the cart 's weight . . see also . motorized shopping cart toy wagon . references . external links . shopping cart–related injuries to children american academy of
