Gustave Caillebotte

early life . gustave caillebotte was born on 19 august 1848 to an upper-class parisian family living in the rue du faubourg-saint-denis . his father , martial caillebotte ( 1799–1874 ) , was the inheritor of the family 's military textile business and was also a judge at the seine department 's tribunal de commerce . caillebotte 's father was twice widowed before marrying caillebotte 's mother , céleste daufresne ( 1819–1878 ) , who had two more sons after gustave : rené ( 1851–1876 ) and martial ( 1853–1910 ) . anne distel , et al . , gustave caillebotte : urban impressionist , abbeville press , new york , 1995 , , p . 311 caillebotte was born at home on rue du faubourg-saint-denis in paris , and lived there until 1866 , when his father had a home built on 77 rue de miromesnil . beginning in 1860 , the caillebotte family began spending many of their summers in yerres , a town on the yerres river about south of paris , where martial caillebotte , sr . had purchased a large property . it probably was around this time that caillebotte began to draw and paint . caillebotte earned a law degree in 1868 and a license to practice law in 1870 , and he also was an engineer . shortly after his education , he was drafted to fight in the franco-prussian war , and served from july 1870 to march 1871 in the garde nationale mobile de la seine . kirk varnedoe 1987 , p . 2 . artistic life . development . after the war , caillebotte began visiting the studio of painter léon bonnat , where he began to study painting seriously . he developed an accomplished style in a relatively short time and had his first studio in his parents ' home . in 1873 , caillebotte entered the école des beaux-arts , but apparently did not spend much time there . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , p . 30 he inherited his father 's fortune in 1874 and the surviving sons divided the family fortune after their mother 's death in 1878 . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , pp . 19 , 180 gustave and his brother sold the yerres estate and moved into an apartment in the boulevard haussmann in paris . around 1874 , caillebotte had met and befriended several artists working outside the académie des beaux-arts , including edgar degas and giuseppe de nittis , and attended ( but did not participate in ) the first impressionist exhibition of 1874 . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , p . 312 the '' impressionists '' – also called the '' independents '' , '' intransigents '' , and '' intentionalists '' – had broken away from the academic painters showing in the annual salons . caillebotte made his debut in the second impressionist exhibition in 1876 , showing eight paintings , including , les raboteurs de parquet ( the floor scrapers ) ( 1875 ) , his earliest masterpiece . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , p . 19 its subject matter , the depiction of labourers preparing a wooden floor ( thought to have been that of the artist 's own studio ) was considered '' vulgar '' by some critics and this is the probable reason for its rejection by the salon of 1875 . at the time , the art establishment deemed only rustic peasants or farmers acceptable subjects from the working class . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , p . 37 the painting is now at the musée d'orsay in paris . a second version , in a more realistic style resembling that of degas , also was exhibited , demonstrating caillebotte 's range of technique and his adept restatement of the same subject matter . style . with regard to the composition and painting style of his works , caillebotte may be considered part of the first movement after impressionism : neo-impressionism . the second period of pointillism , whose main representative was georges seurat , announced its influence in the late works that caillebotte painted at his country house in petit gennevilliers . nathalia brodskaïa and victoria charles , gustave caillebotte ( 1848-1894 ) , new york , 2014 , parkstone press international , caillebotte 's style belongs to the realism ( arts ) but was strongly influenced by his impressionist associates . in common with his precursors jean-françois millet and gustave courbet , as well his contemporary degas , caillebotte aimed to paint reality as it existed and as he saw it , hoping to reduce the inherent theatricality of painting . perhaps because of his close relationship with so many of his peers , his style and technique vary considerably among his works , as if '' borrowing '' and experimenting , but not really sticking to any one style . at times , he seems very much in the degas camp of rich-colored realism ( especially his interior scenes ) ; at other times , he shares the impressionist commitment to '' optical truth '' and employs an impressionistic pastel-softness and loose brush strokes most similar to renoir and pissarro , although with a less vibrant palette . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , p . 13 the tilted ground common to these paintings is characteristic of caillebotte 's work , which may have been strongly influenced by japanese prints and the new technology of photography , although evidence of his use of photography is lacking . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , p . 38 cropping and '' zooming-in '' , techniques that commonly are found in caillebotte 's oeuvre , may also be the result of his interest in photography , but may just as likely be derived from his intense interest in perspective effects . a large number of caillebotte 's works also employ a very high vantage point , including view of rooftops ( snow ) ( vue de toits ( effet de neige ) ) ( 1878 ) , boulevard seen from above ( boulevard vu d'en haut ) ( 1880 ) , and a traffic island ( un refuge , boulevard haussmann ) ( 1880 ) . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , pp . 153 , 171 . themes . image : g . caillebotte - jeune homme à la fenêtre.jpg thumb left young man at his window his brother rené ( 1875 ) , private collection caillebotte painted many domestic and familial scenes , interiors , and portraits . many of his paintings depict members of his family ; young man at his window ( jeune homme à la fenêtre ) ( 1875 ) shows rené in the home on rue de miromesnil ; the orange trees ( les orangers ) ( 1878 ) , depicts martial jr . and his cousin zoé in the garden of the family property at yerres ; and portraits in the country ( portraits à la campagne ) ( 1875 ) includes caillebotte 's mother along with his aunt , cousin , and a family friend . there are scenes of dining , card playing , piano playing , reading , and sewing , all executed in an intimate , unobtrusive manner that portrays the quiet ritual of upper-class indoor life . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , pp . 178–180 his country scenes at yerres focus on pleasure boating on the leisurely stream as well as fishing and swimming , and domestic scenes around his country home . he often used a soft impressionistic technique reminiscent of renoir to convey the tranquil nature of the countryside , in sharp contrast to the flatter , smoother strokes of his urban paintings . in oarsman in a top hat ( 1877 ) , he effectively manages the perspective of a passenger in the back of a rowboat facing his rowing companion and the stream ahead , in a manner much more realistic and involving than manet 's boating ( 1874 ) . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , pp . 74–75 caillebotte is best known for his paintings of urban paris , such as the europe bridge ( le pont de l'europe ) ( 1876 ) , and paris street ; rainy day ( rue de paris ; temps de pluie , also known as la place de l'europe , temps de pluie ) ( 1877 ) . the latter is almost unique among his works for its particularly flat colors and photo-realistic effect , which give the painting its distinctive and modern look , almost akin to american realists such as edward hopper . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , p . 116 many of his urban paintings were quite controversial due to their exaggerated , plunging perspective . kirk varnedoe 1987 , p . 3 in man on a balcony ( 1880 ) , he invites the viewer to share the balcony with his subject and join in observing the scene of the city reaching into the distance , again by using unusual perspective . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , p . 143 showing little allegiance to any one style , many of caillebotte 's other urban paintings produced in the same period , such as the place saint-augustin ( 1877 ) , are considerably more impressionistic . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , p . 110 caillebotte 's still life paintings focus primarily on food , some at table ready to be eaten and some ready to be purchased , as in a series of paintings he made of meat at a butcher shop . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , pp . 233–236 he also produced some floral still-life paintings , particularly in the 1890s . rounding out his subject matter , he painted a few nudes , including homme au bain ( 1884 ) and nude on a couch ( 1882 ) , which , although provocative in its realism , is ambivalent in its mood — neither overtly erotic nor suggestive of mythology — themes common to many nude paintings of women during that era . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , p . 214 . later life . in 1881 , caillebotte acquired a property at petit-gennevilliers , on the banks of the seine near argenteuil , and he moved there permanently in 1888 . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , p . 268 he ceased showing his work at age 34 and devoted himself to gardening and to building and racing yachts , and he spent much time with his brother , martial , and his friend auguste renoir . renoir often came to stay at petit-gennevilliers , and engaged in far-ranging discussions on art , politics , literature , and philosophy . caillebotte was a model for renoir 's 1881 painting , luncheon of the boating party . never married , caillebotte appears to have had a serious relationship with charlotte berthier , a woman eleven years his junior and of the lower class , to whom he left a sizeable annuity . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , p . 184 caillebotte 's painting career slowed dramatically in the early 1890s when he stopped making large canvases . caillebotte died of pulmonary congestion while working in his garden at petit-gennevilliers in 1894 at age 45 . he was interred at père lachaise cemetery in paris . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , p . 23 for many years and in part because he never had to sell his work to support himself , caillebotte 's reputation as a painter was overshadowed by his recognition as a supporter of the arts . kirk varnedoe 1987 , p . 10 seventy years after his death , however , art historians began reevaluating his artistic contributions . his striking use of varying perspective is particularly admirable and sets him apart from his peers who may have otherwise surpassed him . his art was largely forgotten until the 1950s when his descendants began to sell the family collection . in 1964 , the art institute of chicago acquired paris street ; rainy day , spurring american interest in him . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , p . 25 by the 1970s , his works were being exhibited again and critically reassessed . the national gallery of art ( washington , d.c . ) and the kimbell art museum ( fort worth , texas ) organized a major retrospective display of caillebotte 's painting for exhibition in 2015–2016 , to pursue further the rediscovery of his work . morton , mary & shackelford , george t.m . , 2015 . patron and collector . caillebotte 's sizable allowance , along with the inheritance he received after the death of his father in 1874 and his mother in 1878 , allowed him to paint without the pressure to sell his work . it also allowed him to help fund impressionist exhibitions and support his fellow artists and friends ( claude monet , auguste renoir , and camille pissarro among others ) by purchasing their works and , at least in the case of monet , paying the rent for their studios . caillebotte bought his first monet in 1875 and was especially helpful to that artist 's career and financial survival . kirk varnedoe 1987 , p . 4 he was precise in his sponsorship ; notably absent are works by georges seurat and paul gauguin , or any of the symbolists . in 1890 he played a major role in assisting claude monet in organizing a public subscription and in persuading the french state to purchase édouard manet 's 1863 olympia . pbs.org cultureshock , manet 's olympia . other interests . in addition , caillebotte used his wealth to fund a variety of hobbies for which he was quite passionate , including philately , orchid growing , yacht building , and even textile design ( the women in his paintings madame boissière knitting , 1877 , and portrait of madame caillebotte , 1877 , may be working on patterns created by caillebotte ) . after his death , he was inscribed in the roll of distinguished philatelists , and the collection he formed with his brother martial is now in the british library . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , pp . 21–22 . caillebotte 's collection . convinced after the death in 1876 of his younger brother rené that his own life would be short , caillebotte wrote his will while still in his twenties . in the will , caillebotte bequeathed a large collection to the french government . this collection ultimately included sixty-eight paintings by various artists : camille pissarro ( nineteen ) , claude monet ( fourteen ) , pierre-auguste renoir ( ten ) , alfred sisley ( nine ) , edgar degas ( seven ) , paul cézanne ( five ) , and édouard manet ( four ) . at the time of caillebotte 's death , the impressionists were still largely condemned by the art establishment in france , which was dominated by academic art and specifically , the académie des beaux-arts . because of this , caillebotte realised that the cultural treasures in his collection would likely disappear into '' attics '' and '' provincial museums '' . he therefore stipulated that they must be displayed in the luxembourg palace ( devoted to the work of living artists ) , and then in the louvre . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , p . 24 the french government would not agree to these terms . in february 1896 , they finally negotiated terms with renoir , who was the executor of the will , under which they took thirty-eight of the paintings to the luxembourg palace . the installation constituted the first presentation of the impressionists in a public venue in france . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , p . 318 the remaining twenty-nine paintings ( one by degas was taken by renoir in payment for his services as executor ) were offered to the french government twice again , in 1904 and 1908 , and were both times refused . when the government finally attempted to claim them in 1928 , the bequest was repudiated by the widow of caillebotte 's brother martial caillebotte . most of the remaining works were purchased by albert c . barnes and now are held by the barnes foundation . anne distel , et al . , 1995 , pp . 24–25 forty of caillebotte 's own works are held by the musée d'orsay . his man on a balcony , boulevard haussmann ( homme au balcon , boulevard haussmann ) ( 1880 ) , sold for more
