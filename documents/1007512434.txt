numerous elements such as herrings , jumping , and a soundtrack , as well as graphical improvements , were added in just three weeks . porting the game from linux to windows was easy , as it used cross-platform tools such as opengl and simple directmedia layer . a major update including those improvements , version 0.60 , was freely uploaded to sourceforge for both linux and windows on october 2 , 2000 . a minor patch for that release was often included in most linux distributions , and a port for macintosh was released in november 21 , 2000 . . ports and remakes . on february 5 , 2002 , sunspire studios released in retail a closed-source and commercial expansion of the game titled tux racer , with each cd designed to support both linux and windows operating systems . improvements from the open-source version include a vastly enhanced engine and graphics , the ability to perform tricks , character selection , and competitive multiplayer . the open-source version of tux racer , however , remained available to download on sourceforge . sunspire studios ceased business in the early- to mid-2000s . since its inception , tux racer has seen unofficial forks and updates . one of the most popular examples is extreme tux racer , released in september 2007 and itself based on a previous fork , planetpenguin racer . an arcade version of the game was released by roxor games , making it the first gpl-licensed video game to receive an arcade adaption . the game and subsequent forks have also been ported to various other platforms , for instance android and ubuntu touch . reception . tux racer was well-received , with the latest version seeing over one million downloads as of october 2001 since its release in january , according to sunspire studios . it was a personal fan favorite among linux users , who often ranked it as the best or one of the best free games . in august 2000 , lee anderson of linuxworld.com commended the game 's graphics , speed , and the easiness of the ability to create tracks . in 2001 , tuxradar said the game provided a '' shining light '' of what free applications could achieve . in its 2001 preview , the brazilian magazine supergamepower considered the game 's graphics to be the best aspect and described the sound as not innovative , but good . also in 2001 , macaddict compared the game 's fast-paced style to podracing in star wars and summed up the macintosh port as '' more fun than words can describe . '' the commercial version of tux racer attracted little attention . andon logvinov of igromania described it as a '' pure arcade game '' featuring nothing but four selectable characters and a set of courses with fish scattered about . he described the gameplay as calm and addictive and the music as relaxing , and praised the character models and track layout , with his only criticism being the system requirements . seiji nakamura of the japanese website game watch described it as cute and humorous and praised the game 's graphics and shadow and reflection effects , but found the game to lack appeal for adults . even after its production 's cessation , tux racer has continued to be generally well-received , largely concerning its forks . linux journal gave it an editors ' choice award in the '' game or entertainment software '' category in 2005 . digit applauded the graphics and replayability , as well as the speed of the game and the abundance of courses , but found the music to be monotonous . daniel voicu of softpedia praised the extreme tux racer fork for being relaxing and funny and having the ability to reset tux , as well as noted the game 's fast pace , but criticized its perceived lack of interactivity and having tux look like a '' plastic puppet . '' linux for you also called the fork entertaining , but also criticized its bugs and the '' plastic '' look of tux . . references . external links . tux racer on sourceforge official website for commercial tux racer tux racer arcade and the new tux2 arcade
