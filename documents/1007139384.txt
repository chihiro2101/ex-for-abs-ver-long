Jean-Henri Fabre

biography . fabre was born on 21 december 1823 in saint-léons in aveyron , france . fabre was largely an autodidact , owing to the poverty of his family . nevertheless , he acquired a primary teaching certificate at the young age of 19 and began teaching in carpentras whilst pursuing further studies . in 1849 , he was appointed to a teaching post in ajaccio ( corsica ) , then in 1853 moved on to the lycée in avignon . fabre was a popular teacher , physicist , chemist and botanist . however , he is probably best known for his findings in the field of entomology , the study of insects , and is considered by many to be the father of modern entomology . much of his enduring popularity is due to his marvellous teaching ability and his manner of writing about the lives of insects in biographical form , which he preferred to a clinically detached , journalistic mode of recording . in doing so he combined what he called '' my passion for scientific truth '' with keen observations and an engaging , colloquial style of writing . fabre ( translated ) wrote : his souvenirs entomologiques is a series of texts on insects and arachnids . he influenced the later writings of charles darwin , who called fabre '' an inimitable observer '' . fabre , however , was a christian who remained sceptical about darwin 's theory of evolution , as he always held back from all theories and systems . his special force was exact and detailed observation , field research , always avoiding general conclusions from his observations , which he considered premature . grant , susan t .
