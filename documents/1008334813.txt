'' now it makes no difference when or where or how a writer stumbles upon the idea which is to serve as his central purpose . it may spring from his head at a moment 's notice like athena , full armored – as was the case with the late frank norris , who , as has often been told , came one morning to his publisher 's office , pale and trembling all over with excitement , and gasping out , almost inarticulately , '' i 've got a big idea ! a great big idea ! the biggest idea ever ! '' it was the outlined scheme for his trilogy of the epic of the wheat – the trilogy which began with the octopus and the pit , and which poor norris did not live to round out with the wolf .

'' introduction '' to the pit . new york : penguin books . . critical reception . although some of his novels remain highly admired , aspects of norris 's work have not fared well with literary critics in the late 20th and early 21st century . as donald pizer writes '' frank norris 's racism , which included the most vicious anti-semitic portrayals in any major work of american literature , has long been an embarrassment to admirers of the vigor and intensity of his best fiction and has also contributed to the decline of his reputation during the past several generations . '' other scholars have confirmed norris 's antisemitism . lebowich , joseph ( 1904 ) . '' the jew of frank norris , '' the menorah , vol . xxxvi , pp . 27–31 . levy , richard s . ( 2005 ) . antisemitism : a historical encyclopedia of prejudice and persecution , vol . i , abc-clio , pp . 511–512 norris 's work is often seen as strongly influenced by the scientific racism of the late 19th century , such as that espoused by his professor at the university of california , berkeley , joseph leconte . along with his contemporary jack london , norris is seen as '' reconstructing american identity as a biological category of anglo-saxon masculinity . '' in norris 's work , critics have seen evidence of racism , antisemitism , and contempt for immigrants and the working poor , all of whom are seen as the losers in a social darwinism struggle for existence . additionally , his '' exaggeratedly muscular novels '' seem to posit women as biologically subordinate to men . . legacy . norris 's novel the pit was adapted for the theater by channing pollock in four acts . produced by william a . brady , the play premiered at new york 's lyric theatre on february 10 , 1904 . a film adaptation of the pit was produced in 1917 , by william a . brady 's picture plays inc . norris 's short story '' a deal in wheat '' ( 1903 ) and the novel the pit were the basis for the 1909 d.w . griffith film a corner in wheat . norris 's moran of the lady letty was adapted by monte m . katterjohn in 1922 . directed by george melford , the film starred rudolph valentino and dorothy dalton . norris 's mcteague has been filmed twice . the best known version is the 1924 film entitled greed directed by erich von stroheim . an earlier adaptation , mcteague ( film ) , was produced in 1915 by the world film company , starring fania marinoff and holbrook blinn . in 1962 the frank norris cabin was designated a national historic landmark . an opera by william bolcom , based loosely on his 1899 novel , mcteague , was premiered by chicago 's lyric opera in 1992 . the work is in two acts , with libretto by arnold weinstein and robert altman . the lyric opera 's presentation featured ben heppner in the title role and catherine malfitano as trina , the dentist 's wife . in 2008 , the library of america selected norris 's newspaper article '' hunting human game '' for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of american true crime . frank norris , '' hunting human game , '' the wave , january 23 , 1897 . an alley-way in san francisco is named for him ( frank norris place ) . it runs from polk st . to larkin st . and is located parallel to and in between pine st . and bush st . in the city 's lower nob hill district . a tavern on san francisco 's polk street , near frank norris place , is named mcteague 's saloon in honor of norris 's novel mcteague ( 1899 ) . the interior and exterior are decorated with objects and imagery associated with the novel . the popular writing quip , '' i hate writing , but love having written '' is credited to a letter of writing advice written by norris , published posthumously in 1915 . . works . fiction ( 1892 ) . yvernelle . philadelphia : j.b . lippincott company .
