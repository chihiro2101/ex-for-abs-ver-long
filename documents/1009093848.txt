interviews were also taped . post-assignment interviews revealed that the majority of students ( 16 ) yielded positive opinions about group work , but two students felt that group work is best reserved for oral activities and discussions rather than writing assignments . for example , one interviewee outlined the fact that in group work ideas are freely exchanged and when reading a paragraph , each person in the group can pick out important ideas in the paragraph . according to another interviewee , collaborative writing allowed students to learn from each other by watching each other work . apart from the academic aspect of collaborative writing , four respondents argued that group work is a fun and enjoyable activity . the majority of interviewees gave positive reviews , but one argued that group work was difficult when it came to criticizing another 's work and another argued that there is a power imbalance when writing is based on ability . the two students who were stark opponents of collaborative writing revealed that it was hard to concentrate on their work and they were embarrassed by their supposedly poor english skills . doctoral student jason palmeri found that when it came to inter-professional collaboration , most of the issues stemmed from miscommunication . in differing disciplines , one person may have a level of expertise and understanding that is foreign to another . the article gave the example of a nurse and an attorney having different areas of expertise , so therefore they had differing understanding of concepts and even the meaning of the same words . while much of the issues resulted from miscommunication , the article claimed that some nurse consultants resisted change in terms of altering their writing style to fit the understanding or standards of the attorneys . as an educational tool . collaborative writing is used by educators to teach novice authors of all ages and educational levels to write . collaborative writing helps push participants to explore , discuss and help with learning capabilities . collaborative writing corporate by contributing ideas with others . the quantity of learning and growth . in the past ten years , most studies say that most students are motivated in collaborative writing because of their improvement in writing competencies . when students work in groups , it generally produces shorter yet better text such as grammatical accuracy and fulfillment . it gives students ideas and gives them information . a study conducted by stephen bremner , an english professor at the city university of hong kong , investigated eight business communication textbooks to test the depth in which they provided students with a knowledge of collaborative writing in the workplace and how to execute those processes . the study found that , generally , textbooks highlighted the role of collaborative writing in the workplace . textbooks listed the pros of collaborative writing such as saving time , more superior documents due to each individual 's strengths and specialized knowledge , a well-crafted message due to team work , balanced abilities , and an interest in accomplishing a common goal . the article claimed that the textbooks examined gave students a basic knowledge of collaboration in the workplace , but they also lacked the information that showed students the realities of collaborative writing in the workplace with few activities presented in the textbooks that mirror collaborative activities in the workplace . much of the activities that featured group work seemed more idealistic rather than based in reality , where the writing process occurred in only controlled and orderly environments . bremner also found that group work in the classroom also did not properly simulate the power hierarchies present in the workplace . . tools . atlas is a wiki-like git-managed authoring platform from o'reilly media that is based on the open source web-based git repository manager ( version control system ) '' gitlab '' . for collaborative code-writing mostly revision control systems like team foundation version control ( used in team foundation server ) and git ( used in github , bitbucket , gitlab and codeplex ) are used in parallel writing . collaborative real-time editors like etherpad , hackpad , google docs , microsoft office , and authorea . online platforms mainly focused on collaborative fiction that allow other users to continue a story 's narrative such as protagonize and ficly . wikis like wikipedia , wikia and tv tropes . < ! -- . authorship . an author acquires copyright if their work meets certain criteria . in the case of works created by one person , typically , the first owner of a copyright in that work is the person who created the work , i.e . the author . but , when more than one person creates the work in collaboration with one another , then a case of joint authorship can be made provided some criteria are met .
