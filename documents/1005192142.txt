Ultra high frequency

propagation characteristics . radio waves in the uhf band travel almost entirely by line-of-sight propagation ( los ) and ground reflection ; unlike in the hf band there is little to no reflection from the ionosphere ( skywave propagation ) , or ground wave . uhf radio waves are blocked by hills and can not travel beyond the horizon , but can penetrate foliage and buildings for indoor reception . since the wavelengths of uhf waves are comparable to the size of buildings , trees , vehicles and other common objects , reflection and diffraction from these objects can cause fading due to multipath propagation , especially in built-up urban areas . atmospheric moisture reduces , or attenuates , the strength of uhf signals over long distances , and the attenuation increases with frequency . uhf tv signals are generally more degraded by moisture than lower bands , such as vhf tv signals . since uhf transmission is limited by the visual horizon to 30–40 & nbsp ; miles ( 48–64 & nbsp ; km ) and usually to shorter distances by local terrain , it allows the same frequency channels to be reused by other users in neighboring geographic areas ( frequency reuse ) . radio repeaters are used to retransmit uhf signals when a distance greater than the line of sight is required . occasionally when conditions are right , uhf radio waves can travel long distances by tropospheric ducting as the atmosphere warms and cools throughout the day . antennas . thumb the length of an antenna is related to the length of the radio waves used . due to the short wavelengths , uhf antennas are conveniently stubby and short ; at uhf frequencies a monopole antenna , the most common omnidirectional antenna is between 2.5 and 25 & nbsp ; cm long . uhf wavelengths are short enough that efficient transmitting antennas are small enough to mount on handheld and mobile devices , so these frequencies are used for two-way land mobile radio systems , such as walkie-talkies , two way radios in vehicles , and for portable wireless devices ; cordless phones and cell phones . omnidirectional uhf antennas used on mobile devices are usually short whips , sleeve dipoles , rubber ducky antennas or the planar inverted f antenna ( pifa ) used in cellphones . higher gain omnidirectional uhf antennas can be made of collinear arrays of dipoles and are used for mobile base stations and sector antenna . the short wavelengths also allow high gain antennas to be conveniently small . high gain antennas for point-to-point communication links and uhf television reception are usually yagi , log periodic , corner reflectors , or reflective array antennas . at the top end of the band slot antennas and parabolic dishes become practical . for satellite communication , helical , and turnstile antennas are used since satellites typically employ circular polarization which is not sensitive to the relative orientation of the transmitting and receiving antennas . for television broadcasting specialized vertical radiators that are mostly modifications of the slot antenna or reflective array antenna are used : the slotted cylinder , zig-zag , and panel antennas . applications . uhf television broadcasting fulfilled the demand for additional over-the-air television channels in urban areas . today , much of the bandwidth has been reallocated to land mobile , trunked radio and mobile telephone use . uhf channels are still used for digital television . since at uhf frequencies transmitting antennas are small enough to install on portable devices , the uhf spectrum is used worldwide for land mobile radio systems , two-way radios used for voice communication for commercial , industrial , public safety , and military purposes . examples of personal radio services are gmrs , pmr446 , and uhf cb . some wireless computer networks use uhf frequencies . the widely adopted gsm and umts cellular networks use uhf cellular frequencies . major telecommunications providers have deployed voice and data cellular networks in vhf/uhf range . this allows mobile phones and mobile computing devices to be connected to the public switched telephone network and the internet . uhf radars are said to be effective at tracking stealth fighters , if not stealth bombers . wi-fi operates at 2412 mhz-2484 mhz . lte also operates on uhf frequencies . examples of uhf frequency allocations . australia . uhf cb ( land mobile service ) : 476–477 & nbsp ;

cm band ) . united states . uhf channels are used for digital television broadcasting on both over the air channels and cable television channels . since 1962 , uhf channel tuners ( at the time , channels 14-83 ) have been required in television receivers by the all-channel receiver act . however , because of their more limited range , and because few sets could receive them until older sets were replaced , uhf channels were less desirable to broadcasters than vhf channels ( and licenses sold for lower prices ) . a complete list of us television frequency allocations can be found at north american television frequencies there is a considerable amount of lawful unlicensed activity ( cordless phones , wireless networking ) clustered around 900 & nbsp ; mhz and 2.4 & nbsp ; ghz , regulated under title 47 cfr part 15 . these ism bands – frequencies with a higher unlicensed power permitted for use originally by industrial , scientific , medical apparatus – are now some of the most crowded in the spectrum because they are open to everyone . the 2.45 & nbsp ; ghz frequency is the standard for use by microwave ovens , adjacent to the frequencies allocated for bluetooth network devices . the spectrum from 806 & nbsp ; mhz to 890 & nbsp ; mhz ( uhf channels 70–83 ) was taken away from tv broadcast services in 1983 , primarily for analog mobile telephony . in 2009 , as part of the digital television switch-off time announced , the spectrum from 698 & nbsp ; mhz to 806 & nbsp ; mhz ( uhf channels 52–69 ) was removed from tv broadcasting , making it available for other uses . channel 55 , for instance , was sold to qualcomm for their mediaflo service , which was later sold to at & t , and discontinued in 2011 . some us broadcasters had been offered incentives to vacate this channel early , permitting its immediate mobile use . the fcc 's scheduled auction for this newly available spectrum was completed in march 2008 . the fcc has allowed americans to connect any device and any application to the 22 & nbsp ; mhz of radio spectrum that people are calling the 700 & nbsp ; mhz band . the fcc did not include a wholesale condition , which would have required the owner of the band to resell bandwidth to third parties who could then service the end user . google argued that the wholesale requirement would have stimulated internet competition . as of 2007 , 96 % of the country 's broadband access was controlled by dsl and cable providers . a wholesale condition could have meant a third option for internet service . fcc opens up us wireless spectrum , the register , 1 august 2007 , cade metz 225 & ndash ;
