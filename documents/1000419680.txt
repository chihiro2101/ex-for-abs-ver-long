Frank Martin (composer)

childhood and youth . born into a huguenot family in the eaux-vives quarter of geneva , the youngest of the ten children of a calvinist pastor named charles martin , frank martin started to improvise on the piano prior to his formal schooling . at the age of nine he had already written a few songs without external musical instruction . at 12 , he attended a performance of johann sebastian bach 's st . matthew passion and was deeply affected by it . respecting his parents ' wishes , he studied mathematics and physics for two years at geneva university , but at the same time was also studying piano , composition and harmony with his first music teacher joseph lauber ( 1864–1953 ) , a geneva composer and by that time a leading figure of the city 's musical scene . in the 1920s , martin worked closely with émile jaques-dalcroze from whom he learned much about rhythm and musical theory . between 1918 and 1926 martin lived in zurich , rome and paris . compositions of this time show him searching for an authentic musical voice of his own . in 1926 he established the chamber music society of geneva which , for the next ten years he conducted , as well as contributing on the clavichord and piano . during this period he was also teaching musical theory and improvisation at the jaques-dalcroze institute , and chamber music at the geneva conservatory . works . martin 's music was often inspired by his christianity . in this regard , his compositions stemmed from '' the individuality rather than universality of his faith . certainly broader than calvinism '' . the petite symphonie concertante of 1944–45 made martin 's international reputation , and is the best known of his orchestral works , as the early mass is the best known of his choral compositions , and the jedermann monologues for baritone and piano or orchestra the best known of his works for solo voice . other martin pieces include a full-scale symphony ( 1936–37 ) , two piano concertos , a harpsichord concerto , a violin concerto , a cello concerto , a concerto for seven wind instruments , and a series of six one-movement works he called '' ballades '' for various solo instruments with piano or orchestra . among a dozen major scores for the theater are operatic settings of shakespeare 's der sturm ( the tempest ) in august wilhelm schlegel 's german version ( 1952–55 ) and of molière 's monsieur de pourceaugnac ( 1960–62 ) , and the satirical fairy tale la nique à satan ( thumbing your nose at satan ; 1928–31 ) . his works on sacred texts and subjects include the large-scale theater piece le mystère de la nativité ( the mystery of the nativity ; 1957/1959 ) and are widely considered among the finest religious compositions of the 20th century . swiss musician ernest ansermet , a champion of his music from 1918 onwards , recorded many of martin 's works , including the oratorio in terra pax ( 1944 ) , with the orchestre de la suisse romande . martin based his mature style on his personal variant ( first used around 1932 ) of arnold schoenberg 's twelve-tone technique , but he did not abandon tonality . lean textures and habitual rhythmic vehemence distinguish his style from schoenberg 's . some of martin 's most acclaimed music comes from his last decade . he worked on his last cantata , et la vie l'emporta , until ten days before his death . he died in naarden , the netherlands , and was buried in geneva at the cimetière des rois . martin 's music is widely performed in continental europe , and to a much lesser extent , in the united kingdom . . principal works . orchestra . rythmes for orchestra ( 1926 ) fox trot for small orchestra ( 1927 ) guitare for orchestra ( 1934 ) symphonie for orchestra ( 1936–37 ) passacaille for large orchestra ( 1944/62 ) symphonie concertante for orchestra ( 1944–46 ) études for string orchestra ( 1955–56 ) ouverture en hommage à mozart for orchestra ( 1956 ) les quatre éléments for orchestra ( 1963–64 ) erasmi monumentum for large orchestra and organ ( 1969 ) . concerto . piano concerto no . 1 ( 1933–34 ) danse de la peur for two pianos and small orchestra ( 1936 ) ballade for alto saxophone or basset horn , string orchestra , piano , timpani and percussion ( 1938 ) ballade for piano and orchestra ( 1939 ) ballade for flute , string orchestra and piano ( 1939–41 ) ballade for trombone or tenor saxophone and small orchestra ( 1940–41 ) petite symphonie concertante for harp , harpsichord , piano and two string orchestras ( 1944–45 ) ballade for violoncello and small orchestra ( 1949 ) concerto for seven wind instruments , timpani , percussion , and string orchestra ( 1949 ) violin concerto ( 1950 ) concerto for harpsichord and small orchestra ( 1951–52 ) cello concerto ( 1965 ) piano concerto no . 2 ( 1969 ) trois danses for oboe , harp , string quintet and string orchestra ( 1970 ) ballade for viola , wind orchestra , harpsichord , harp , timpani and percussion ( 1972 ) polyptyque , for violin and two small string orchestras ( 1973 ) . ballet . das märchen vom aschenbrödel ( 1941 ) . chamber . pavane couleur du temps for string quintet ( 1920 ) piano quintet ( 1922 ) trio sur des mélodies populaires irlandaises ( 1925 ) violin sonata no . 2 ( 1931–32 ) rhapsodie for two violins , two violas and double bass ( 1935 ) string trio ( 1936 ) sonata da chiesa for viola d'amore and organ ( 1938 ) ballade for trombone or tenor saxophone and piano ( 1938 ) ballade for flute and piano ( 1939 ) ballade for trombone and piano ( 1940 ) string quartet ( 1967 ) . guitar . quatre pièces brèves ( 1933 ) . piano . eight préludes ( 1947–48 ) fantasia on flamenco rhythms ( 1970–73 ) . organ . passacaille ( 1944 ) agnus dei pour orgue ( 1965/66 ) . choral . les dithyrambes for soloists , chorus and orchestra ( 1918 ) mass for double chorus ( 1922/26 ) cantate pour le temps de noël for soloists , female chorus , boys ' chorus , string orchestra , harpsichord and organ ( 1929–30 ) in terra pax , oratorio for soloists , two choirs and orchestra ( 1944 ) golgotha , oratorio for soloists , chorus , organ , and orchestra ( 1945–48 ) songs of ariel for chorus a cappella ( 1950 ) le mystère de la nativité , oratorio for chorus and orchestra ( 1957–59 ) pseaumes de genève for mixed chorus , children 's chorus , organ and orchestra ( 1958 ) pilate for soloists , chorus and orchestra ( 1964 ) requiem for soloists , chorus , orchestra and big organ ( 1971–72 ) . vocal . le vin herbé , secular oratorio for twelve voices , seven strings and piano ( 1938/41 ) die weise von liebe und tod des cornets christoph rilke for alto and small orchestra ( 1942–43 ) for baritone or alto and orchestra ( 1943–44 ) trois chants de noël ( texts by albert rudhardt ) ( 1947 ) suite for baritone and orchestra ( 1952/55 ) maria-triptychon for soprano , violin and orchestra ( 1967–68 ) poèmes de la mort for tenor , baritone , bass and three electric guitars ( 1969–71 ) et la vie l'emporta for alto , baritone , chamber chorus and chamber ensemble ( 1974 ) . opera . der sturm ( 1952–55 ) perroux , alain ( 2011 ) .
