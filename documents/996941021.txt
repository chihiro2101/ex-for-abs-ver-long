Anna Katharine Green

life and work . she was born in brooklyn , new york on november 11 , 1846 . green had an early ambition to write romantic verse , and she corresponded with ralph waldo emerson . when her poetry failed to gain recognition , she produced her first and best known novel , the leavenworth case ( 1878 ) , praised by wilkie collins , and the hit of the year . she became a bestseller author , eventually publishing about 40 books . on november 25 , 1884 , green married the actor and stove designer , and later noted furniture maker , charles rohlfs ( 1853 – 1936 ) , who was seven years her junior . rohlfs toured in a dramatization of green 's the leavenworth case . after his theater career faltered , he became a furniture maker in 1897 , and green collaborated with him on some of his designs . together they had one daughter and two sons : rosamund rohlfs , roland rohlfs , and sterling rohlfs . her daughter rosamund married robert twitty palmer . green died on april 11 , 1935 , in buffalo , new york , at the age of 88 . her husband died the following year . critical response . though green 's book the leavenworth case is frequently cited as the first mystery written by an american woman , the dead letter by seeley regester was published earlier ( 1866 ) . in a discussion of women writers of detective fiction , scholar ellen higgins in 1994 chronicled the work of green as popularizing the genre a decade before arthur conan doyle brought out his first sherlock holmes story . '' i only found out afterward that some people were a little upset with it because they do n't want to hear about women competing with the master '' , higgins said . green is credited with shaping detective fiction into its classic form , and developing the series detective . her main character was detective ebenezer gryce of the new york metropolitan police force , but in three novels he is assisted by the nosy society spinster amelia butterworth , the prototype for miss marple , miss silver and other creations . she also invented the 'girl detective ' : in the character of violet strange , a debutante with a secret life as a sleuth . indeed , as journalist kathy hickman writes , green '' stamped the mystery genre with the distinctive features that would influence writers from agatha christie and conan doyle to contemporary authors of suspenseful '' whodunits '' . in addition to creating elderly spinster and young female sleuths , green 's innovative plot devices included dead bodies in libraries , newspaper clippings as '' clews '' , the coroner 's inquest , and expert witnesses . yale law school once used her books to demonstrate how damaging it can be to rely on circumstantial evidence . written in 1878 , her first book , the leavenworth case : a lawyer 's story , sparked a debate in the pennsylvania state senate over whether the book could '' really have been written by a woman '' . green was in some ways a progressive woman for her time—succeeding in a genre dominated by male writers—but she did not approve of many of her feminism contemporaries , and she was opposed to women 's suffrage . legacy . in 2002 , buffalo literary walking tours began an annual series of weekend walking tours highlighting authors with local connections . green is included along with mark twain , f . scott fitzgerald , herman melville , taylor caldwell , and others . green 's short story '' the intangible clue '' featuring violet strange was adapted by chris harrald for the second series of bbc radio 4 's drama series the rivals and starred jeany spark as violet strange . . selected works . detective and mystery novels mr . gryce and amelia butterworth series the leavenworth case ( 1878 ) mr . gryce 1 a strange disappearance ( 1880 ) mr . gryce 2 the sword of damocles : a story of new york life ( 1881 ) mr . gryce 3 hand and ring ( 1883 ) mr . gryce 4 behind closed doors ( 1888 ) mr . gryce 5 a matter of millions ( 1891 ) mr . gryce 6 the doctor , his wife , and the clock ( 1895 ) mr . gryce 7 . novellette , shorter than the others that affair next door ( 1897 ) ( amelia butterworth i ) . also mr . gryce 8 lost man 's lane : a second episode in the life of amelia butterworth ( 1898 ) also mr . gryce 9 the circular study ( 1900 ) ( amelia butterworth iii ) also mr . gryce 10 one of my sons ( 1901 ) mr . gryce 11 initials only ( color frontispiece by arthur keller ) ( 1911 ) mr . gryce 12 the mystery of the hasty arrow ( 1917 ) mr . gryce 13 other mysteries x y z : a detective story ( 1883 ) the mill mystery ( 1886 ) 7 to 12 : a detective story ( 1887 ) forsaken inn ( 1890 ) cynthia wakeham 's money ( 1892 ) miss hurd : an enigma ( 1894 ) doctor izard ( 1895 ) agatha webb ( 1899 ) caleb sweetwater 1 the filigree ball : being a full and true account of the solution of the mystery concerning the jeffrey-moore affair ( 1903 ) the millionaire baby ( illustrations by arthur i . keller ) ( 1905 ) the chief legatee ' ( 1906 ) the woman in the alcove ( illustrations by arthur i . keller ) ( 1906 ) caleb sweetwater 2 the mayor 's wife ( illustrations by alice barber stephens ( 1907 ) the house of the whispering pines ( 1910 ) caleb sweetwater 3 three thousand dollars ( 1910 ) dark hollow ( 1914 ) the step on the stair ( 1923 ) non-detective novels the defence of the bride , and other poems ( 1882 ) risifi 's daughter , a drama ( 1887 ) marked '' personal '' , a drama within a drama .
