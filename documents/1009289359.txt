IUCN Red List

history . 1964 red list of threatened plants . the 1964 iucn red list of threatened plants used the older pre-criteria red list assessment system . plants listed may not , therefore , appear in the current red list . iucn advise that it is best to check both the online red list and the 1997 plants red list publication . . 2006 release . the 2006 red list , released on 4 may 2006 evaluated 40,168 species as a whole , plus an additional 2,160 subspecies , varieties , aquatic stocks , and subpopulations . 2007 release . on 12 september 2007 , the world conservation union ( iucn ) released the 2007 iucn red list of threatened species . in this release , they have raised their classification of both the western lowland gorilla ( gorilla gorilla gorilla ) and the cross river gorilla ( gorilla gorilla diehli ) from endangered to critically endangered , which is the last category before extinct in the wild , due to ebola virus and poaching , along with other factors . russ mittermeier , chief of swiss-based iucn 's primate specialist group , stated that 16,306 species are endangered with extinction , 188 more than in 2006 ( total of 41,415 species on the red list ) . the red list includes the sumatran orangutan ( pongo abelii ) in the critically endangered category and the bornean orangutan ( pongo pygmaeus ) in the endangered category . . 2008 release . the 2008 red list was released on 6 october 2008 at the iucn world conservation congress in barcelona and '' confirmed an extinction crisis , with almost one in four mammals at risk of disappearing forever '' . the study shows at least 1,141 of the 5,487 mammals on earth are known to be threatened with extinction , and 836 are listed as data deficient . . 2012 release . the red list of 2012 was released 19 july 2012 at rio+20 earth summit ; nearly 2,000 species were added , with 4 species to the extinct list , 2 to the rediscovered list . the iucn assessed a total of 63,837 species which revealed 19,817 are threatened with extinction . 3,947 were described as '' critically endangered '' and 5,766 as '' endangered '' , while more than 10,000 species are listed as '' vulnerable '' . the list is queryable at : at threat are 41 % of amphibian species , 33 % of reef-building corals , 30 % of conifers , 25 % of mammals , and 13 % of birds . the iucn red list has listed 132 species of plants and animals from india as '' critically endangered '' . . categories . species are classified by the iucn red list into nine groups , specified through criteria such as rate of decline , population size , area of geographic distribution , and degree of population and distribution fragmentation . there is an emphasis on the acceptability of applying any criteria in the absence of high quality data including suspicion and potential future threats , '' so long as these can reasonably be supported '' . extinct ( ex ) – beyond reasonable doubt that the species is no longer extant . extinct in the wild ( ew ) – survives only in captivity , cultivation and/or outside native range , as presumed after exhaustive surveys . critically endangered ( cr ) – in a particularly and extremely critical state . endangered ( en ) – very high risk of extinction in the wild , meets any of criteria a to e for endangered . vulnerable ( vu ) – meets one of the 5 red list criteria and thus considered to be at high risk of unnatural ( human-caused ) extinction without further human intervention . near threatened ( nt ) – close to being at high risk of extinction in the near future . least concern ( lc ) – unlikely to become extinct in the near future . data deficient ( dd ) not evaluated ( ne ) in the iucn red list , '' threatened '' embraces the categories of critically endangered , endangered , and vulnerable . 1994 categories and 2001 framework . the older 1994 list has only a single '' lower risk '' category which contained three subcategories : conservation dependent ( lr/cd ) near threatened ( lr/nt ) least concern ( lr/lc ) in the 2001 framework , near threatened and least concern became their own categories , while conservation dependent was removed and its contents merged into near threatened . possibly extinct . the tag of '' possibly extinct '' ( pe ) is used by birdlife international , the red list authority for birds for the iucn red list . birdlife international has recommended pe become an official tag for critically endangered species , and this has now been adopted , along with a '' possibly extinct in the wild '' tag for species with populations surviving in captivity but likely to be extinct in the wild ( e.g . spix 's macaw ) . versions . there have been a number of versions , dating from 1991 , including : version 1.0 ( 1991 ) version 2.0 ( 1992 ) version 2.1 ( 1993 ) version 2.2 ( 1994 ) version 2.3 ( 1994 ) version 3.0 ( 1999 ) version 3.1 ( 2001 ) version 4 ( 2015 ) . criticism . in 1997 , the iucn red list received criticism on the grounds of secrecy ( or at least poor documentation ) surrounding the sources of its data . these allegations have led to efforts by the iucn to improve its documentation and data quality , and to include peer reviews of taxa on the red list . the list is also open to petitions against its classifications , on the basis of documentation or criteria . it has been suggested that the iucn red list and similar works are prone to misuse by governments and other groups that draw possibly inappropriate conclusions on the state of the environment or to affect exploitation of natural resources . . see also . cites conservation status red list index regional red list species by iucn red list category wildlife conservation . references . bibliography . hilton-taylor , c . a history of the iucn data book and redlist 2012-5-11 . iucn red list of threatened species , 2009 . summary statistics . retrieved 2009-12-19 . iucn . 1994 iucn red list categories and criteria version 2.3 . retrieved 2009-12-19 . iucn . 2001 iucn red list categories and criteria version 3.1 . retrieved 2009-12-19 . rodrigues , a.s.l . , pilgrim , j.d . , lamoreux , j.f . , hoffmann , m . & brooks , t.m . 2006 . the value of the iucn red list for conservation trends in ecology & evolution 21 ( 2 ) : 71–76 . sharrock , s . and jones , m . 2009 . conserving europe 's threatened plants – report on the lack of a european red list and the creation of a consolidated list of the threatened plants of europe . retrieved 2011-03-23 . external links .
