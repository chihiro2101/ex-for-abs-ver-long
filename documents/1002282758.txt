'' boaz '' , jewish encyclopedia he notices ruth , the widowed moabite daughter-in-law of naomi , a relative of his ( see family tree ) , gleaning grain in his fields . he soon learns of the difficult circumstances her family is in and ruth 's loyalty to naomi . in response , boaz invites her to eat with him and his workers , as well as deliberately leaving grain for her to claim while keeping a protective eye on her . ruth approaches boaz and asks him to exercise his right of kinship and marry her . boaz accepts , provided that another with a superior claim declines . since the first son of ruth and a kinsman of her late husband would be deemed the legal offspring of the decedent and heir to elimelech , the other kinsman defers to boaz . in marrying ruth , boaz revives elimelech 's lineage , and the patrimony is secured to naomi 's family . their son was obed , father of jesse , and grandfather of david . according to josephus , '' ant .
