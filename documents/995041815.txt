Perfect game (baseball)

history . the first known use in print of the term perfect game occurred in 1908 . i . e . sanborn 's report for the chicago tribune about addie joss 's performance against the white sox calls it '' an absolutely perfect game , without run , without hit , and without letting an opponent reach first base by hook or crook , on hit , walk , or error , in nine innings '' . deutsch et al . ( 1975 ) , p . 68 . this source also includes an 1880 clipping from the new york herald describing lee richmond 's perfect game for worcester . a double error by cleveland resulted in the lone run scoring , and the writer described it as '' the only lapse from perfect play made by the clevelands during the game '' ; the use of the word '' perfect '' in this context refers only to defensive play , a different meaning than its modern baseball sense , as cleveland 's pitcher also surrendered three hits and a walk . see deutsch et al . ( 1975 ) , p . 14 . writeups for the ward perfect game of 1880 and the young game of 1904 describe the games as '' wonderful '' and other effusive terms , but do not use the term '' perfect game '' . several sources have claimed that the first recorded usage of the term perfect game was by ernest lanigan in his baseball cyclopedia , made in reference to charlie robertson 's 1922 perfect game . buckley ( 2002 ) , p . 16 , citing paul dickson , the dickson baseball dictionary ( 1989 ) ; coffey ( 2004 ) , p . 50 . the baseball cyclopedia reference came in a supplement to the 1922 edition of the book ( a publication of baseball magazine ) and was worded thus : '' charles robertson of chicago americans pitched an absolutely perfect no-hit game against detroit on april 30 , 1922 , no one reaching first . '' the publication listed all the perfect games to that point ( a total of five , including robertson 's ) and used the term '' perfect game '' matter-of-factly , possibly indicating the term was already familiar to the readership . lanigan 's work references a 1914 book called balldom as a source for his list of perfect games , although balldom itself does not use the term '' perfect game '' , merely characterizing the games as '' no batter reached first base . '' lanigan was also familiar with sanborn 's baseball articles , making various references to him elsewhere in the cyclopedia , although there is nothing indicating that sanborn necessarily inspired lanigan 's use of the term . the chicago tribune came close to the term in describing lee richmond 's game for worcester in 1880 : '' richmond was most effectively supported , every position on the home nine being played to perfection . '' buckley ( 2002 ) , p . 15 . similarly , in writing up john montgomery ward 's 1880 perfect game , the new york clipper described the '' perfect play '' of providence 's defense . buckley ( 2002 ) , p . 26 . as of 2014 , the current major league baseball definition of a perfect game is largely a side effect of the decision made by the major leagues ' committee for statistical accuracy on september 4 , 1991 , to redefine a no-hitter as a game in which the pitcher or pitchers on one team throw a complete game of nine innings or more without surrendering a hit . young ( 1997 ) , p . 29 . that decision removed a number of games that had long appeared in the record books : those lasting fewer than nine innings , and those in which a team went hitless in regulation but then got a hit in extra innings . the definition of perfect game was made to parallel this new definition of the no-hitter , in effect substituting '' baserunner '' for '' hit '' . as a result of the 1991 redefinition , for instance , harvey haddix receives credit for neither a perfect game nor a no-hitter for his performance on may 26 , 1959 , when he threw 12 perfect innings against the milwaukee braves before allowing a baserunner in the 13th . forker , obojski , and stewart ( 2004 ) , p . 116 . there has been one perfect game in the world series , thrown by don larsen for the new york yankees against the brooklyn dodgers on october 8 , 1956 . by coincidence , the second yankee pitcher to throw a perfect game , david wells in 1998 , graduated from the same high school as larsen - point loma high school in san diego , california . in a further coincidence , larsen was in attendance when the third yankee pitcher to throw a perfect game , david cone in 1999 , performed the feat on the same day that larsen and yogi berra ( the catcher in the 1956 perfect game ) were invited to do the ceremonial first pitch . ron hassey is the only catcher in mlb history to have caught more than one perfect game ( his first was with pitcher len barker in 1981 and his second was with pitcher dennis martínez in 1991 ) . the most recent perfect game pitched in major league baseball was thrown by félix hernández of the seattle mariners against the tampa bay rays on august 15 , 2012 . he struck out the side twice and struck out twelve total batters in the 1–0 victory over tampa bay . since the beginning of the 2009 mlb season , it was the third time that the tampa bay rays were on the losing end of a perfect game . the only perfect game thrown in a little league world series championship was by ángel macías of the monterrey , mexico , team in 1957 . . see also . armando galarraga 's near-perfect game eight-ender in curling for love of the game , a 1991 novel by pulitzer prize–winning author michael shaara golden set in tennis maximum break in snooker nine-dart finish in darts perfect game in bowling the perfect game , a 2009 movie . notes . sources . alvarez , mark , ed .
