Penny (United States coin)

history of composition . the composition of the penny has varied over time : . wheat cent ( 1909–1958 ) . a study of three potential reverses resulted in the approval of a very simple design bearing two wheatheads in memorial style . between these , in the center of the coin , are the denomination and united states of america , while curving around the upper border is the national motto , e pluribus unum , latin for '' out of many , one '' . the original model bore brenner 's name on the reverse , curving along the rim below united states of america . before the coins were issued , however , the initials '' vdb '' were substituted because officials at the united states mint felt the name was too prominent . after the coin was released , many protested that even the initials were conspicuous and detracted from the design . because the coin was in great demand , and because to make a change would have required halting production , the decision was made to eliminate the initials entirely . thus in 1909 the u.s . had six different cents : the 1909 and 1909-s indian head cents , and four lincoln coins : 1909 vdb , 1909-s vdb , 1909 and 1909-s . in all cases the philadelphia mintages far exceeded the san francisco issues . while the smallest mintage is the '09-s indian , the '09-s vdb is the key lincoln date , and hence is most valuable . its mintage of 484,000 is only 1.7 % of the plain v.d.b . lincoln memorial cent ( 1959–2008 ) . on february 12 , 1959 , a revised reverse design was introduced as part of the 150th anniversary of lincoln 's birth . no formal competition was held . frank gasparro , then assistant engraver at the philadelphia mint , prepared the winning entry , selected from a group of 23 models that the engraving staff at the mint had been asked to present for consideration . again , only the approval of the secretary of the treasury was necessary to make the change because the design had been in use for more than the required 25 years . the imposing marble lincoln memorial provides the central motif , with the legends e pluribus unum and united states of america completing the design , together with the denomination . the initials '' fg '' appear on the right , near the shrubbery . lincoln bicentennial cents ( 2009 ) . the presidential 1 coin act of 2005 required that the cent 's reverse be redesigned in 2009 . this resulted in the mintage of four different coins showing scenes from abraham lincoln 's life in honor of the bicentennial of his birth . these four designs , unveiled september 22 , 2008 at a ceremony held at the lincoln memorial on the national mall in washington , d.c . , are : birth and early childhood in kentucky : this design features a log cabin and lincoln 's birth year 1809 . it was designed by richard masters and sculpted by jim licaretz . this cent was released into circulation on lincoln 's 200th birthday , february 12 , 2009 , at a special ceremony at larue county high school in hodgenville , kentucky , lincoln 's birthplace . the mintage was extremely low compared to prior years ( see lincoln cent mintage figures ) . it has been nicknamed the '' log cabin penny '' . formative years in indiana : this design features a young lincoln reading while taking a break from rail splitting . it was designed and sculpted by charles vickers . nicknamed the '' indiana penny '' , it was released on may 14 , 2009 . professional life in illinois : this design features a young professional lincoln standing before the springfield illinois state capitol . it was designed by joel iskowitz and sculpted by don everhart . nicknamed the '' illinois penny '' , it was released on august 13 , 2009 . presidency in washington , d.c . : this design features the half-completed capitol dome . it was designed by susan gamble and sculpted by joseph menna . this fourth cent was released to the public on november 12 , 2009 . u.s . mint released collector 's sets containing this design in copper prior to the public launch of this design in zinc . special 2009 cents struck for sale in sets to collectors had the metallic copper content of cents minted in 1909 ( 95 % copper , 5 % tin and zinc ) . those struck for circulation retained the normal composition of a zinc core coated with copper . union shield cent ( 2010–present ) . the 2005 act that authorized the redesign for the bicentennial stated that another redesigned reverse for the lincoln cent will be minted which '' shall bear an image emblematic of president lincoln 's preservation of the united states of america as a single and united country '' . – presidential 1 coin act of 2005 , title vi , §303 . '' the design on the reverse of the 1-cent coins issued after december 31 , 2009 , shall bear an image emblematic of president lincoln 's preservation of united states of america as a single and united country . '' retrieved 2009-11-30 . eighteen designs were proposed for the reverse of the 2010 cent . on april 16 , 2009 the commission of fine arts ( cfa ) met and selected a design that showed 13 wheat sheaves bound together with a ring symbolizing american unity as one nation . later this design was withdrawn because it was similar to coinage issued in germany in the 1920s . the citizens coinage advisory committee later met and chose a design showing a union shield with superimposed in a scroll ; e pluribus unum was also depicted in the upper portion of the shield . in june 2009 the cfa met again and chose a design featuring a modern rendition of the american flag . as a part of the release ceremony for the last of the 2009 cents on november 12 , the design for the 2010 cent was announced . the design chosen was the one that was chosen earlier by the ccac . according to the mint , the 13 stripes on the shield '' represent the states joined in one compact union to support the federal government , represented by the horizontal bar above '' . the mint also noted that a shield was commonly used in paintings in the capitol hallways painted by constantino brumidi , an artist in the capitol active during the lincoln presidency . the obverse of the cent was also changed to a modern rendition of brenner 's design . the new union shield design replaces the lincoln memorial in use since 1959 . the coin was designed by artist lyndall bass and sculpted by u.s . mint sculptor-engraver joseph menna . in january 2010 , the coins were released early in puerto rico ; this was caused by a shortage of 2009-dated pennies on the island . the new design was released at a ceremony at the abraham lincoln presidential library in springfield , illinois on february 11 , 2010 . in 2017 , cents minted in philadelphia were struck with a '' p '' mintmark to celebrate the 225th anniversary of the u.s . mint . 2017 is the only year that philadelphia cents have had a mintmark . . '' capped cents '' . to commemorate the fire at the ss morro castle , local coin dealer louis werner made copper caps depicting the morro castle surrounded by the legend '' the morro castle fire '' these were then encased over one side of a lincoln cent . according to '' mrs . astor 's horse '' by stanley walker : concessionaires inside the hall carried on a lively business . a man at a stamping machine put copper caps on pennies with the head of lincoln on one side and the inscription ff morro castle fire , september , 1934 , asbury park '' on the other . postcard sellers in the hall disposed of 150,000 pictures of the burning ship during the first few days after the disaster . as soon as they came off the press , heart-rending poems and ballads about the fire were hawked about . later , to commemorate the trial of richard hauptmann , werner made another design depicting the hunterdon county courthouse , where the trial was held , and surrounded by the legend '' hauptmann trial , flemington , nj '' . jaeger , katherine , a guide book of united states tokens and medals , whitman publishing , 2008 . another part of the text in '' mrs . astor 's horse '' states : a man with a metal press did a fair sort of business . he set up for business on the porch of the hotel . he had constructed a die depicting the hunterdon county courthouse , surrounded by the legend , hauptmann trial , flemington , n.j . on the stand beside the press lay several hundred bright new pennies and several fine strips of copper . by running the copper strips through the press , together with the pennies , he turned out lincoln heads backed by the courthouse and the legend . the pieces sold for five cents each , three for a dime . also , from 1935 to 1938 , during the christmas season , werner made a design depicting santa claus . shoppers in manhattan received these by donating 10 cents ; if they donated an extra 5 cents , their cent came in a greeting card holder . other capped cents by werner include commemoratives for admiral richard e . byrd 's expedition to the south pole and joe louis . there was also a design featuring the lord 's prayer . composition . bronze , 1909–1942 . initially the alloy of the lincoln cent followed that established for this denomination with the indian head design in 1864 , 95 % copper and 2.5 % tin and 2.5 % zinc . wartime zinc-plated steel , 1943 . the composition of the lincoln cent was changed in 1943 . production of the war-time cent was provided for in an act of congress approved on december 18 , 1942 , which also set as the expiration date of the authority december 31 , 1946 . low-grade carbon steel formed the base of these coins , to which a zinc coating thick was deposited on each side electrolytically as a rust preventive . this coating was applied to the steel before the blanks were made , leaving the rims of these coins extremely susceptible to rust . the same size was maintained , but the weight was reduced from the standard to , by using a lighter alloy . production commenced on february 27 , 1943 , and by december 31 of that year , the three mint facilities had produced 1,093,838,670 of the one-cent coins . the copper released for the war effort was enough to meet the combined needs of two cruisers , two destroyers , 1,243 flying fortresses , 120 field guns and 120 howitzers , or enough for 1,250,000 shells for large field guns.there were tin cents copper cents and steel cents . wartime brass , 1944–1946 . numerous complaints about the gray color of the 1943 cents , especially that they could be mistaken for dimes , led to a change in composition of the wartime cent . on january 1 , 1944 , the mint was able to adopt a modified alloy , the supply being derived from expended shell casings which , when melted , furnished a composition similar to the original , but with a much smaller trace of tin . the original weight of was also restored . bronze , 1947–1962 . shell casings were no longer used after 1946 and the original copper-tin-zinc '' bronze '' composition was again used . brass , 1962–1982 . the composition of the coin was changed again slightly in 1962 . mint officials felt that deletion of the tin content would have no adverse effect on the wearing qualities of the coin , whereas the manufacturing advantages to be gained with the alloy stabilized at 95 % copper and 5 % zinc would be of much benefit . congressional authority for this modification is contained in an act of congress approved on september 5 , 1962 . experimental aluminum cents , 1974 . during the early 1970s , the price of copper rose to a point where the cent almost contained one cent 's worth of copper . this led the mint to test alternate metals , including aluminum and bronze-clad steel . 1974 aluminum cent , and in 1973 , a total of 1,579,324 such coins were struck ( dated 1974 ) and ready for public release . a few were distributed to members of the u.s . congress , but aluminum was ultimately rejected for a variety of reasons . about a dozen aluminum cents are believed to still be in the hands of collectors , although they are now considered illegal to own . alt url one aluminum cent was donated to the smithsonian institution . another is in the hands of the family of a deceased u.s . capitol police officer , known as the toven specimen , and was certified as authentic in 2005 . alt url copper-plated zinc , 1982–present . in mid-1982 , the coin 's composition was changed again , this time to copper-plated zinc . the last mostly-copper cents ( 95 % copper metal composition ) were produced by the denver mint on october 22 , 1982 . the copper-plated zinc cent coins are still being produced today . they are composed of an inner core alloy of 99.2 % zinc and 0.8 % copper with an outer plating of pure copper , for an overall composition of 97.5 % zinc and 2.5 % copper , and are minted on blanks produced for the mint by an outside manufacturer ( jarden zinc products ) . except for the new lighter total coin weight of 2.5 & nbsp ; grams each , these newer coins are identical in diameter and thickness , and nearly in appearance , to the mostly copper ( 95 % ) cents issued before mid-1982 , which weighed 3.11 & nbsp ; grams each . a few pennies were struck by error in brass dated 1983 and are extremely rare . . matte proof lincolns 1909 to 1916 . when the lincoln cent was introduced in 1909 , it was discovered that the coining dies and their curved fields were unable to be polished to proof coining condition by existing mint equipment . to produce proof coinage for collectors , the u.s . mint adopted the french technique of the matte proof , which was thought to highlight the design , while leaving the details of the coin as the designer intended . this was done by a sandblasting of the dies prior to use . when struck by the high pressure hydraulic press of the philadelphia mint medal room , the result was a semi-rough surface , a gentle luster and strongly defined wide square rims . these coins were produced in very small numbers , and the dies quickly developed small marks , known as diagnostics . these marks are used today by third party graders and collectors to authenticate the coin . sold for mere pennies over face during the years of production , they were not popular with collectors . when new , the coins were wrapped in a tarnish-proof tissue , which over time proved to be anything but . since many of these coins sat for decades unsold , vivid colors and toning developed . it is not unusual to see vivid blues , greens , lavender , coppery orange , deep reds and purple hues on these coins . eagerly collected by numismatists today , they are among the most valuable lincoln cents . unencapsulated coins are easily identified by wide , square outer rims , quite unlike the rounded edges of business strikes . mint errors specific to lincoln cents . through mint errors , a number of rare and valuable lincoln cents have been produced . some random errors , such as an off-center strike , slightly increase the value of the coin , and are sought after by niche collectors . however some errors were systemic , and produced a number of coins with exactly the same problem in the same year . these have become recognized varieties that are often extremely valuable and sought after by mainstream collectors . the first doubled die error occurred during the production of the 1909 vdb . not identified until the 1970s , it shows the rty in liberty and the 190 of the date slightly doubled . this coin is extremely rare in high grades . in 1922 , no one-cent coins were produced by the philadelphia mint . however , three of the four pairs of denver mint worn and overly polished dies then produced the weak d and no d varieties , making them appear as if they had been produced in philadelphia . these varieties are known as the 1922 plain cents or 1922 no '' d '' cents . collectors must be wary of removed mint marks . there are a few 1943 cents that were produced in bronze , as opposed to the steel/zinc composition used that year . there are 10 to 12 known to exist . likewise , a few 1944 cents were produced in steel/zinc . in 1955 , a hubbing error caused some cents to get struck with an obverse die which showed doubling in all of the obverse devices , producing a prominent doubling of the date , and to a less noticeable degree , the rest of the obverse . this is known as the 1955 doubled die cent . a similar die error occurred in 1969 on dies used at the san francisco mint . while the 1955 doubled die cent is well-known and widely collected , the 1969-s doubled die is far rarer , with an uncirculated specimen selling for as much as 126,500 in a 2008 heritage auction . the same mechanism produced 1972 , 1983 , 1984 , and 1995 doubled die cents . doubled dies are known for practically every date in the lincoln cent series , but most are minor , and less impressive compared to the 1955 and the other doubled die varieties mentioned here . in 1990 , 3,055 proof cents were struck at the san francisco mint without the '' s '' mint mark , making them appear as if they had been struck at the philadelphia mint . however , as no proof cents were struck in philadelphia that year , they are easily distinguishable as errors , and highly valuable . the reverse of some lincoln cents minted in 1992 at the philadelphia and denver mints and some of those minted in 1998 and 1999 at the san francisco mint feature a smaller-than-normal gap between the first two letters of america . these coins , known as the close am variety are valued at 20,000 and 5,000 for the 1992 specimens in gem uncirculated condition and 3,000 and 1,000 for the san francisco specimens in gem proof condition . the reverse of some lincoln cents minted in 1998 , 1999 , and 2000 in philadelphia feature a larger-than-normal gap between the first two letters of america . these coins , known as the wide am variety are valued at 10 , 500 , and 5 , respectively , in gem uncirculated condition . these reverse die errors are technically '' mule '' errors , as the reverse error dies were the same as normal proof coins of the same date . toxicity . zinc , a major component of u.s . cents minted after mid-1982 , is toxic in large quantities . swallowing such a coin , which is 97.5 % zinc , can cause damage to the stomach lining because of the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach . dawn n . bothwell , m.d . , and eric a . mair , m.d . , faap . chronic

numismatics and regulations . it has been suggested that the cent should be eliminated as a unit of currency for several reasons including that many americans do not actually spend them , but rather only receive them in change at stores and proceed to return them to a bank for higher denomination currencies , or cash them in at coin counter . most modern vending machines do not accept pennies , further diminishing their utility , and the production cost ( figured in u.s . dollars ) now exceeds the face value of the coin , caused by increasing inflation . in 2001 and 2006 , for example , united states representative jim kolbe ( r ) of arizona introduced bills which would have stopped production of pennies ( in 2001 , the legal tender modernization act , and in 2006 , the currency overhaul for an industrious nation coin act ) . in anticipation of the business of melting down u.s . pennies and u.s . nickels for profit , the u.s . mint , which is a part of the us department of the treasury , implemented new regulations on december 14 , 2006 , which criminalize the melting of pennies and nickels and place limits on export of the coins . violators can be punished with a fine of up to 10,000 usd and/or imprisoned for a maximum of five years . . metal content and manufacturing costs . the price of metal drives the cost to manufacture a cent . the secretary of the treasury has authority to alter the percentage of copper and zinc in the one-cent coin if needed due to cost fluctuations . for years , the mint 's production and shipping costs for cents have exceeded the face value of the coin . ( the mint 's fixed costs and overhead , however , are absorbed by other circulating coins . ) in fiscal year 2010 , each cent cost 1.79 cents to produce and ship . after reaching a peak cost of 2.41 cents in 2011 , the cost declined to 2.00 cents in 2012 , 1.83 cents in 2013 , 1.70 cents in 2014 , 1.67 cents in 2015 , it then rose again : 1.82 cents in 2017 , 2.06 cents in 2018 , and 1.99 cents in 2019 . as a result , the u.s . treasury loses millions of dollars every year producing cents . for example , the loss in 2013 was 55 million . when copper reached a record high in february 2011 , the melt value of a 95 % copper cent was more than three times its face value . as of january 21 , 2014 , a pre-1982 cent contained 2.20325 cents ' worth of copper and zinc , making it an attractive target for melting by people wanting to sell the metals for profit . in comparison , post-1982 copper-plated zinc cents have a metallurgical value of only 0.55152 cents . . see also . 1943 steel cent 1955 doubled-die cent 1974 aluminum cent large cent ( united states coin ) legal tender modernization act mill ( currency ) penny ( canadian coin ) penny debate in the united states ring cent take a penny , leave a penny united states mint coin production . references . external links .
