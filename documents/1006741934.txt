plot . on saturday , december 15 , 1973 , navy lifers signalman first class billy '' badass '' buddusky ( jack nicholson ) and gunner 's mate first class richard '' mule '' mulhall ( otis young ) are awaiting orders in norfolk , virginia . they are assigned a shore patrol detail escorting 18-year old seaman larry meadows ( randy quaid ) to portsmouth naval prison near kittery , maine . meadows has been court-martialed , dishonorably discharged , and sentenced to eight years in the brig for stealing 40 from a charity fund run by the wife of a senior officer . buddusky and mulhall are given one week to escort meadows to portsmouth , and if they fail to complete the task on time or let meadows go free , they will be kicked out of the navy and lose all benefits and pay . despite their initial resentment of the detail , and realizing that their prisoner is a kleptomaniac who steals compulsively , billy and mule begin to like meadows as they escort him on a train ride through the wintry northeastern states . they decide to show him a good time before delivering him to the authorities . with several days to spare before they are due in portsmouth , the trio make stops along their route to provide bon-voyage adventures for meadows . in washington , dc , they go to a diner and order burgers , fries , and milkshakes . next they go to a bar , but they are denied drinks , as meadows is underage and can not provide id . instead they get drunk in an alley , missing their train which forces them to stay overnight at a hotel , where they stay up all night watching tv and drinking . at the hotel , buddusky teaches meadows a few flag semaphore signals and tries to get the young prisoner to stick up for himself by provoking him into a fight . the following morning , the trio take a detour to camden , new jersey to seek out meadows ' mother , only to find her away for the day and the house a pigsty , cluttered with empty liquor bottles . when they arrive at grand central station in new york city , buddusky instigates a fight with a group of marines in a restroom , with mulhall and meadows eventually joining in . the older sailors later take meadows ice skating at rockefeller center and go bar hopping , where buddusky gambles with their per diem money by playing darts with a group of bar patrons . they also encounter a group of nichiren buddhists chanting away in an apartment building , and the buddhists teach meadows how to pray . the buddhists invite the trio to a house party , where one of the members offers to help meadows flee to canada , but he declines out of loyalty to buddusky and mulhall . buddusky also unsuccessfully attempts to seduce a woman at the party , while mulhall makes awkward conversation about serving in the navy with the liberal party guests . on the train to boston the next morning , buddusky and mulhall decide to take the virginal meadows to a whorehouse . while in boston , they flag down a cab driver , who takes them to a seedy brothel . meadows selects a young prostitute to lose his virginity to , while buddusky and mulhall wait in the hallway . after an aborted first attempt where he ejaculates too early , mulhall and buddusky pay for meadows to have a second chance with the prostitute . buddusky and mulhall make conversation while waiting for meadows , where buddusky reminisces about his former marriage and his life prior to joining the navy . the next morning , meadows tells the other sailors that despite her profession , he thinks the young prostitute might have had romantic feelings for him . just before they leave for portsmouth , meadows makes a final request for a picnic . the senior sailors buy some hot dogs and attempt a frigid barbecue in the snow at a local park , where buddusky confides in mulhall his concern for meadows and the abuse that he will face at the hands of the marines at the brig . meadows suddenly bolts in a last-ditch effort to run away but slips on the ice and falls . buddusky and mulhall arrive , and buddusky loses his temper and beats meadows up , forcing mulhall to restrain him . buddusky and mulhall take meadows into the prison where he is taken away and marched off to be processed without a word . although buddusky had worried about the brutality awaiting meadows at the hands of the marine guards , the young duty officer ( a first lieutenant wearing an annapolis ring ) , berates buddusky and mulhall for striking meadows . the duty officer asks if meadows had tried to resist or fight , which they deny . the marine also notices that their orders were never officially signed by the master-at-arms in norfolk , meaning effectively they had not left . the angry young marine officer relents when mulhall and buddusky ask to speak to the xo ( executive officer ) . with the detail complete , the pair stride away from the prison complaining about the duty officer 's incompetence because after the rebuke he forgot to keep his copy of the paperwork . both hope their orders will have come through when they get back to norfolk . cast . jack nicholson as signalman 1st class billy l .

were not shot at a canadian naval base , but rather at cfb borden , a major training base for the canadian air force & army . ashby was busted for possession of marijuana while scouting locations in

factor . biskind 1998 , p . 169 . just as the film was about to go into production , crosse was diagnosed with terminal cancer . ashby postponed principal photography for a week to allow crosse to

of the fastest editors in the business , who had been nominated for an academy award for guess who 's coming to dinner . jones put the film back into rushes and six weeks later had a first cut ready that ran four hours . ashby was very impressed with his abilities and trusted him completely . dawson 2009 , p . 145 . jones cut the film with ashby at the filmmaker 's home . the process took an unusually long time , as the director agonized over all the footage he had shot . biskind 1998 , p . 180 . ashby would ignore phone calls from columbia , and eventually executives higher and higher up the corporate ladder tried to contact him . ashby was in london , england , meeting with peter sellers about doing being there when he received a phone call from jones , who told him that columbia was

film . jones refused to give up the film , and ashby called the studio and managed to calm down the officials . towne occasionally visited ashby 's house to check in and did not like the pacing of the
