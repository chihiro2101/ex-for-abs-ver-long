Luck

etymology and definition . thumb the english noun luck appears comparatively late , during the 1480s , as a loan from low german , dutch or frisian luk , a short form of gelucke ( middle high german gelücke ) . compare to old slavic word lukyj ( лукый ) - appointed by destiny and old russian luchaj ( лучаи ) - destiny , fortune . it likely entered english as a gambling term , and the context of gambling remains detectable in the word 's connotations ; luck is a way of understanding a personal chance event . luck has three aspects : rescher , n . , luck : the brilliant randomness of everyday life p . 32 . '' luck accordingly involves three things : ( 1 ) a beneficiary or maleficiary , ( 2 ) a development that is benign ( positive ) or malign ( negative ) from the stand point of the interests of the affected individual , and that , moreover , ( 3 ) is fortuitous ( unexpected , chancy , unforeseeable . ) '' chance news 4.15 . the definition in the oxford english dictionary : '' the fortuitous happening of an event favorable or unfavorable to the interest of a person '' rescher , n . , luck : the brilliant randomness of everyday life p . 28 . '' luck is a matter of having something good or bad happen that lies outside the horizon of effective foreseeability . '' luck is good or bad . rescher , n . , luck : the brilliant randomness of everyday life p . 32 . '' luck thus always incorporates a normative element of good or bad : someone must be affected positively or negatively by an event before its realization can properly be called lucky . '' luck is the result of chance . rescher , n . , luck : the brilliant randomness of everyday life p . 32 . '' that as a far as the affected person is concerned , the outcome came about '' by accident . '' '' luck applies to a sentient being . before the adoption of luck at the end of the middle ages , old english and middle english expressed the notion of '' good fortune '' with the word speed ( middle english spede , old english spēd ) ; speed besides '' good fortune '' had the wider meaning of '' prosperity , profit , abundance '' ; it is not associated with the notion of probability or chance but rather with that of fate or divine help ; a bestower of success can also be called speed , as in '' christ be our speed '' ( william robertson , phraseologia generalis , 1693 ) . the notion of probability was expressed by the latin loanword chance , adopted in middle english from the late 13th century , literally describing an outcome as a '' falling '' ( as it were of dice ) , via old french cheance from late latin cadentia '' falling '' . fortuna , the roman goddess of fate or luck , was popular an allegory in medieval times , and even though it was not strictly reconcilable with christian theology , it became popular in learned circles of the high middle ages to portray her as a servant of god in distributing success or failure in a characteristically '' fickle '' or unpredictable way , thus introducing the notion of chance . interpretations . luck is interpreted and understood in many different ways . as lack of control . luck refers to that which happens to a person beyond that person 's control . this view incorporates phenomena that are chance happenings , a person 's place of birth for example , but where there is no uncertainty involved , or where the uncertainty is irrelevant . within this framework , one can differentiate between three different types of luck : constitutional luck , that is , luck with factors that can not be changed . place of birth and genetic constitution are typical examples . circumstantial luck—with factors that are haphazardly brought on . accidents and epidemics are typical examples . ignorance luck , that is , luck with factors one does not know about . examples can be identified only in hindsight . circumstantial luck with accidental happenstance of favorable discoveries and/or inventions is serendipity . as a fallacy . another view holds that '' luck is probability taken personally . '' a rationalist approach to luck includes the application of the rules of probability and an avoidance of unscientific beliefs . the rationalist thinks that the belief in luck is a result of poor reasoning or wishful thinking . to a rationalist , a believer in luck who asserts that something has influenced his or her luck commits the '' post hoc ergo propter hoc '' logical fallacy : that because two events are connected sequentially , they are connected causally as well . in general : a happens ( luck-attracting event or action ) and then b happens ; therefore , a influenced b . more contemporary authors writing on the subject believe that the definition of good destiny is : one who enjoys good health ; has the physical and mental capabilities of achieving his goals in life ; has good appearance , and ; has happiness in mind and is not prone to accidents . in the rationalist perspective , probability is only affected by confirmed causal connections . the gambler 's fallacy and inverse gambler 's fallacy both explain some reasoning problems in common beliefs in luck . they involve denying the unpredictability of random events : '' i have n't rolled a seven all week , so i 'll definitely roll one tonight '' . philosopher daniel dennett wrote that '' luck is mere luck '' rather than a property of a person or thing . elbow room by daniel clement dennett , p . 92 . '' we know it would be superstitious to believe that '' there actually is such a thing as luck '' - something a rabbits ' foot might bring - but we nevertheless think there is an unsuperstitious and unmisleading way of characterising events and properties as merely lucky . '' . as an essence . image : maneki neko with 7 lucky gods by oimax in asakusa , tokyo.jpg thumb 150px right maneki-neko with seven lucky gods . there is also a series of spiritual , or supernatural beliefs regarding fortune . these beliefs vary widely from one to another , but most agree that luck can be influenced through spiritual means by performing certain rituals or by avoiding certain circumstances . luck can also be a belief in an organization of fortunate and unfortunate events . luck is a form of superstition which is interpreted differently by different individuals . carl jung coined the term synchronicity , which he described as '' a meaningful coincidence '' . abrahamic religions believe god controls future events ; belief in luck or fate is criticised in book of isaiah chapter 65 , verses 11-12 : what will happen to you for offering food and wine to the gods you call good luck and fate ? your luck will end . belief in the extent of divine providence varies ; most acknowledge providence as at least a partial , if not complete influence on luck . christianity , in its early development , accommodated many traditional practices which at different times , accepted omens and practiced forms of ritual sacrifice in order to divine the will of their supreme being or to influence divine favoritism . the concepts of '' divine grace '' or '' blessing '' as they are described by believers closely resemble what is referred to as '' luck '' by others . mesoamerican religions , such as the aztecs , mayans and incas , had particularly strong beliefs regarding the relationship between rituals and the gods , which could in a similar sense to abrahamic religions be called luck or providence . in these cultures , human sacrifice ( both of willing volunteers and captured enemies ) , as well as self-sacrifice by means of bloodletting , could possibly be seen as a way to propitiate the gods and earn favor for the city offering the sacrifice . an alternative interpretation would be that the sacrificial blood was considered as a necessary element for the gods to maintain the proper working order of the universe , in the same way that oil would be applied to an automobile to keep it working as designed . many traditional african practices , such as voodoo and hoodoo , have a strong belief in superstition . some of these religions include a belief that third parties can influence an individual 's luck . shamans and witches are both respected and feared , based on their ability to cause good or bad fortune for those in villages near them . as a self-fulfilling prophecy . some evidence supports the idea that belief in luck acts like a placebo , producing optimism and improving people 's responses to events . in personality psychology , people reliably differ from each other depending on four key aspects : beliefs in luck , rejection of luck , being lucky , and being unlucky . maltby , j . , day , l . , gill , p . , colley , a . , wood , a.m .

'' leaving it to chance '' is a way of resolving issues . for example , flipping a coin at the start of a sporting event may determine who goes first . numerology . most cultures consider some numbers to be lucky or unlucky . this is found to be particularly strong in asian cultures , where the obtaining of '' lucky '' telephone numbers , automobile license plate numbers , and address ( geography ) are actively sought , sometimes at great money expense . numerology , as it relates to luck , is closer to an art than to a science , yet numerologists , astrologists or psychics may disagree . it is interrelated to astrology , and to some degree to parapsychology and spirituality and is based on converting virtually anything material into a pure number , using that number in an attempt to detect something meaningful about reality , and trying to predict or calculate the future based on lucky numbers . numerology is folkloric by nature and started when humans first learned to count . through human history it was , and still is , practiced by many cultures of the world from traditional fortune-telling to on-line psychic reading . science . different thinkers like thomas kuhn have discussed the role of chance in scientific discoveries . richard wiseman did a ten-year scientific study into the nature of luck that has revealed that , to a large extent , people make their own good and bad fortune . his research revealed that '' lucky people generate their own good fortune via four basic principles . they are skilled at creating and noticing chance opportunities , making lucky decisions by listening to their intuition , creating self-fulfilling prophecies via positive expectations , and adopting a resilient attitude that transforms bad luck into good .

( gita , 2 . 47 ) . there are five causes of all actions as given in the samkhya wisdom ; says gita— “ the physical body ( adhisthana ) , the lower ’ i am ’ ( karta ) , the means of perception ( karanam ) , the varied multiple efforts ( vividhasch pruthak cheshta ) and the cosmic wheel of action ( daivam ) , these five sources together are responsible for success or failure of any action “ . ( gita , 18 . 14–15 ) . here the word ‘ daivam ’ does not mean luck , fate . fortune , providence or destiny . none of these english words are the exact synonym for the sanskrit word ‘ daivam ’ here . ‘ daivam ‘ is the cosmic whee of action ( kshara-gati , apara-prakriti , maya ) that keeps the perfect account of our past and present actions . a man who says ; “ nothing is impossible for me ; i am the only hero of all these achievements ; who else is there like me ? “ , he is a man of clouded vision and he does not see the truth . islam . the definition which is much closer to the concept of luck in islam is '' a force that brings good fortune or adversity '' quran 17-13 ( isra ) : '' and ( for ) every man we have fastened to him his fate ( fortune ) in his neck , and we will bring forth for him ( on the ) day ( of ) the resurrection a record which he will find wide open '' . however , there is a very long discussion on how this prefixed destiny , fortune or luck defines attitudes and living behavior and so as to how much amends one can make in this predetermined fate by one 's own contribution through positive actions in accordance with the teachings of islam . there is no concept of luck in islam other than actions determined by allah based on the merit of the choice made by human beings . it is stated in the qur'an ( sura : adh-dhariyat ( the winds that scatter ) verse:22 ) that one 's sustenance is pre-determined in heaven when the lord says : '' and in the heaven is your provision and that which ye are promised . '' however , one should supplicate towards allah to better one 's life rather than hold faith in un-islamic acts such as using '' lucky charms '' . however , in the arabic language there is a word which directly means '' luck '' , which is , and a related word for '' lucky '' , . it is also forbidden to believe in luck or anything else related to luck , as it is classified as shirk ( associating partners to allah or giving any share of any attribution which belongs to allah and allah alone ) . the tunisians retain some native beliefs of berber origin such as the evil eye . a number of practices , such as shutters painted blue are also used to repel evil spirits . . measuring belief in luck . image : horseshoe lucky on door.jpg thumb upright a horseshoe on a door is regarded a protective talisman in some cultures . belief in good luck . darke and freedman ( 1997 ) darke p.r . & freedman j.l .
