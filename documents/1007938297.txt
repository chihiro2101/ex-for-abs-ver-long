The Passion of Saints Perpetua and Felicity

text and content . summary of the passion text . the traditional view has been that perpetua , felicity and the others were martyred owing to a decree of roman emperor septimius severus ( 193–211 ) . this is based on a reference to a decree severus is said to have issued forbidding conversions to judaism and christianity , but this decree is known only from one source , the augustan history , an unreliable mix of fact and fiction . early church historian eusebius describes severus as a persecutor , but the christian apologist tertullian states that severus was well disposed towards christians , employed a christian as his personal physician , and had personally intervened to save several high-born christians known to him from the mob . eusebius ' description of severus as a persecutor likely derives merely from the fact that numerous persecutions occurred during his reign , including those known in the roman martyrology as the martyrs of madaura as well as perpetua and felicity in the roman province of africa , but these were probably as the result of local persecutions rather than empire wide actions or decrees by severus . the details of the martyrdoms survive in both latin and greek texts ( see below ) . perpetua 's account of events leading to their deaths , apparently historical , is written in the first person . a brief introduction by the editor ( chapters i–ii ) is followed by the narrative and visions of perpetua ( iii–ix ) , and the vision of saturus ( xi–xiii ) . the account of their deaths , written by the editor who claims to be an eyewitness , is included at the end ( xiv–xxi ) . perpetua 's account opens with conflict between her and her father , who wishes her to recant her belief . foley o.f.m . , leonard . saint of the day , ( revised by pat mccloskey o.f.m . ) , franciscan media perpetua refuses , and is soon baptized before being moved to prison ( iii ) . after the guards are bribed , she is allowed to move to a better portion of the prison , where she nurses her child and gives its charge to her mother and brother ( iii ) , and the child is able to stay in prison with her for the time being ( iii ) . at the encouragement of her brother , perpetua asks for and receives a vision , in which she climbs a dangerous ladder to which various weapons are attached ( iv ) . at the foot of a ladder is a serpent , which is faced first by saturus and later by perpetua ( iv ) . the serpent does not harm her , and she ascends to a garden ( iv ) . at the conclusion of her dream , perpetua realizes that the martyrs will suffer ( iv ) . perpetua 's father visits her in prison and pleads with her , but perpetua remains steadfast in her faith ( v ) . she is brought to a hearing before the governor hilarianus and the martyrs confess their christian faith ( vi ) . in a second vision , perpetua sees her brother dinocrates , who had died unbaptized from cancer at the early age of seven ( vii ) . she prayed for him and later had a vision of him happy and healthy , his facial disfigurement reduced to a scar ( viii ) . perpetua 's father again visits the prison , and pudens ( the warden ) shows the martyrs ' honor ( ix ) . the day before her martyrdom , perpetua envisions herself defeating a savage egyptian and interprets this to mean that she would have to do battle not merely with wild beasts but with the devil himself ( x ) . saturus , who is also said to have recorded his own vision , sees himself and perpetua transported eastward by four angels to a beautiful garden , where they meet jocundus , saturninus , artaxius , and quintus , four other christians who are burnt alive during the same persecution ( xi–xii ) . he also sees bishop optatus of carthage and the priest aspasius , who beseech the martyrs to reconcile the conflicts between them ( xiii ) . as the editor resumes the story , secundulus is said to have died in prison ( xiv ) . the slave felicitas gives birth to a daughter despite her initial concern that she would not be permitted to suffer martyrdom with the others , since the law forbade the execution of pregnant women ( xv ) . on the day of the games , the martyrs are led into the amphitheatre ( xviii ) . at the demand of the crowd they were first scourged before a line of gladiators ; then a boar , a bear , and a leopard were set on the men , and a wild cow on the women ( xix ) . wounded by the wild animals , they gave each other the kiss of peace and were then put to the sword ( xix ) . the text describes perpetua 's death as follows ; '' but perpetua , that she might have some taste of pain , was pierced between the bones and shrieked out ; and when the swordsman 's hand wandered still ( for he was a novice ) , herself set it upon her own neck . perchance so great a woman could not else have been slain ( being feared of the unclean spirit ) had she not herself so willed it '' ( xix ) . the text ends as the editor extols the acts of the martyrs . debate over editor . scholars generally believe that the passio ss perpetuae et felicitatis narrative was in fact , written by perpetua . if this is true , the text is important because perpetua is one of the first christian female writers before the fourth century whose works have survived . the personal account of a female martyr is also rare , as the stories of other female martyrs were recorded collectively . perpetua 's style is described as '' emotional '' , '' personal '' , '' fragmented '' and '' colloquial '' , which is fitting with the circumstances under which she would have been writing . it should still be acknowledged that the style could have been crafted to give the impression of a female martyr 's diary . although some have suggested that the editor of the text is tertullian , the editor 's identity remains uncertain . the writing style and content of the edited material do seem to suggest that the editor is male . many scholars have examined the male modification and transmission of a female martyrdom story that challenged power dynamics and gender hierarchies within the organized church . this issue of gender may have influenced the redaction tendencies of the editor . brent shaw argues that the editor of the story rewrites perpetua 's experience in such a way that affirms the technical value of her martyrdom while simultaneously presenting her actions as unnatural . furthermore , the dream vision of saturus is considered to be the result of editorial activity , unlikely to have been written by saturus himself because of its distinctive construction and impersonal bent . if the editor is male , he may have been seeking to show that men and women , rather than women alone , are responsible for the dreams and visions received in the narrative . others argue that felicity may have been the initial source for the dream , an attribution changed by the editor in order to circumvent the problematic implications of a female slave who can receive visions . dating issues . the date of their martyrdom is traditionally given as 203 ad . the association of the martyrdom with a birthday festival of the emperor geta , however , might seem to place it after 209 , when geta was made '' augustus '' ( having held the junior title caesar since 198 when his elder brother had been made '' augustus '' ) , though before 211 , when he was assassinated . the acta notes that the martyrdom occurred in the year when minucius timinianus was proconsul in the africa ( province ) , but timinianus is not otherwise attested in history . werner eck notes that the greek version of the acta calls the proconsul μινούκιος ὀππιανός , or minicius opimianus , who is recorded as proconsul for 202/203 . eck , '' ergänzungen zu den fasti consulares des 1 . und 2 . jh.n.chr .

'' every single one of the purported '' montanist '' features of the '' passion '' were ( and remain today ) utterly compatible with orthodox catholicism . controversy over dinocrates . the account of saint perpetua comforting her dead brother has been a point of controversy . the text may imply that the pagan child had not been baptized . augustine addresses his treatise on the soul and its origin to a certain monk renatus who used this account to bolster his claim that unbaptized infants could attain paradise , if not the kingdom of heaven . augustine in turn proposed an explanation for how dinocrates could have been baptized but later estranged from christ by his pagan father . . in popular culture . the once-flowering rambling rose '' félicité et perpétue '' ( r . sempervirens x 'old blush ' its french equivalent name is r .
