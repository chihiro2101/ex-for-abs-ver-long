Average White Band

career . formation . awb was formed in early 1972 in london by alan gorrie , and molly duncan , with owen '' onnie '' mcintyre , michael rosen ( trumpet ) , roger ball , and robbie mcintosh joining them in the original line-up . hamish stuart quickly replaced rosen . duncan and ball , affectionately known as the dundee horns , studied at duncan of jordanstone college of art ( now part of the university of dundee , but which at the time was part of the dundee institute of art and technology , now known as abertay university ) , and were previously members of mogul thrash . gorrie and mcintyre had been members of forever more . mcintyre and mcintosh were used as session musicians on chuck berry 's recording of '' my ding-a-ling '' . according to duncan , members of the band had played together before in scotland , but had moved to london separately and met up by chance at a traffic concert . they decided to jam together ; a friend heard them and remarked : '' this is too much for the average white man , '' which became adapted as the name of the band . . breakthrough . the band 's breakthrough was a support slot at eric clapton 's comeback concert in 1973 . mca records released their debut album , show your hand ( 1973 ) , which sold poorly . bruce mccaskill , who was clapton 's tour manager , liked the band 's music and agreed to manage them . he borrowed money to take them to the us and to promote them . mccaskill had many contacts from his days with clapton and managed to get atlantic records to sign them . the band relocated to los angeles and released the follow-up , awb , better known as the white album . it reached no . 1 and was the first of many with renowned producer arif mardin . mcintosh died of a heroin overdose at a los angeles party on 23 september 1974 . gorrie also overdosed , but cher kept him conscious until medical help arrived . the nme reported in january 1975 that awb played a benefit show for mcintosh 's widow at the marquee club in london . mcintosh was replaced by steve ferrone , previously of bloodstone , who had replaced mcintosh before in brian auger 's oblivion express . in 1975 , the single '' pick up the pieces '' , taken from the no . 1 awb album , reached no . 1 on the us billboard hot 100 chart . the song knocked linda ronstadt 's '' you 're no good '' out of no . 1 and sold over one million copies . it was awarded a gold disc by the r.i.a.a . in march 1975 . it also prompted the j.b . 's , the backup band of the '' godfather of soul '' , james brown , to record and release a song in reply , '' pick up the pieces , one by one '' , under the name aabb ( above average black band ) . it was both a tribute to awb 's knowledge of funk and a tongue-in-cheek play on the scottish band 's name . awb followed up with the lps cut the cake ( 1975 ) and soul searching ( 1976 ) , both big sellers and yielding further top 40 singles . cut the cake was dedicated by the surviving band members to mcintosh 's memory . a double live album '' person to person '' was issued in late 1976 . their next lp , benny & us , was a collaboration with ben e . king . . later career . after several more albums , '' warmer communications '' ( 1978 ) , '' feel no fret '' ( 1979 ) and after a switch to the u.s . arista label , '' shine '' ( 1980 ) and '' cupid 's in fashion '' ( 1982 ) , awb 's audience and sales dwindled . the group initially disbanded by 1983 . their 1980 disco hit '' let 's go round again '' ( uk no . 12 ) , was covered in the late 1990s by louise . ferrone went on to work with duran duran and later with tom petty and the heartbreakers from 1994 until petty 's death in 2017 . hamish stuart joined paul mccartney 's touring group . in 1985 gorrie released a solo album , sleepless nights . the classic lineup of gorrie , mcintyre , ball , stuart , duncan and ferrone reunited for one last time at the atlantic records 40th anniversary in 1988 . gorrie , mcintyre , and ball then continued in 1989 to record aftershock . alex ligertwood ( ex-santana , jeff beck group and another veteran of brian auger 's oblivion express ) also appeared on this album , replacing lead singer hamish stuart , along with eliot lewis who co-wrote with gorrie and joined the band . ligertwood left after the album 's recording and drummer tiger mcneil joined for the reunited band 's live shows . mcneil was with the group until 1994 . he was then succeeded by peter abbott ( ex-blood , sweat & tears ) , who in turn was replaced by fred '' catfish '' alias in september 1998 . drummer adam deitch did a two-year stint with awb from 1999 to 2001 . average white band has continued recording ( 1997 's soul tattoo , 1999 's face to face ) and touring since . ball worked on soul tattoo with the group but was replaced by fred vigdor ( aka freddy v . ) in 1996 . brian dunne took over the drum chair in 2001 and when eliot lewis left the band in september 2002 to pursue other musical opportunities ( including a stint with hall and oates ) , he was replaced by klyde jones . their line-up as of 2002 became alan gorrie ( bass guitar , guitar , lead and backing vocals ) , klyde jones ( keyboards , bass guitar , guitar , lead and backing vocals ) , onnie mcintyre ( guitar , vocals ) , freddy v ( sax , keyboards , vocals ) , and brian dunne ( drums ) . dunne was replaced by rocky bryant as drummer as of the 2006 tour . after jones left in 2011 to join hall and oates , monte croft ( keyboards , bass , guitar ) and former earth , wind & fire member morris pleasure ( keyboards , bass , guitar ) came in to do brief stints before rob aries arrived in 2013 . brent carter ( ex-tower of power ) has been singing with awb since 2011 . in july 2015 , malcolm ‘ molly ’ duncan , steve ferrone and hamish stuart reunited to form the 360 band . this is in essence one half of the original awb . they released an album titled '' three sixty '' in 2017 and have been performing live together along with supporting musicians . as of 2019 , alan gorrie and onnie mcintyre are the only two original members left in the average white band . on 25 june 2019 , the new york times magazine listed average white band among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 universal fire . original tenor sax player molly duncan died on 8 october 2019 , shortly after it had been announced that he had been diagnosed with terminal cancer .
