Thomas Chippendale

life . chippendale was born the only child of john chippendale ( 1690–1768 ) , joiner , and his first wife mary ( née drake ) ( 1693–1729 ) . he received an elementary education at prince henry 's grammar school . '' thomas son of john chippindale of otley joyner bap ye 5th '' ( otley , yorkshire parish register , june 1718 ) the chippendale family had long been involved with the wood working trades and so he probably received his basic training from his father , though it is believed that he was also trained by richard wood in york , before he relocated to london . wood later ordered eight copies of the director . on 19 may 1748 he married catherine redshaw at st george 's chapel , mayfair and they had five sons and four daughters . during 1749 chippendale rented a modest house in conduit court , near covent garden . in 1752 he relocated to somerset court , off the strand . in 1754 chippendale relocated to 60–62 st martin 's lane in london , where for the next 60 years the family business operated , until 1813 when his son , thomas chippendale ( junior ) , was evicted for bankruptcy . during 1754 he also began a partnership with james rannie , a wealthy scottish merchant , who put money into the business at the same time as chippendale produced the first edition of the director . rannie and his bookkeeper , thomas haig , probably cared for the finances of the business . his wife , catherine , died during 1772 . after james rannie died in 1766 , thomas haig seems to have borrowed £2,000 from rannie 's widow , which he used to become chippendale 's partner . one of rannie 's executors , henry ferguson , became a third partner and so the business became chippendale , haig and co . thomas chippendale ( junior ) assumed management of the business in 1776 allowing his father to retire . he relocated to what was then called lob 's fields ( now known as derry street ) in kensington . chippendale married elizabeth davis at fulham parish church on 5 & nbsp ; august 1777 . he fathered three more children . in 1779 chippendale relocated to hoxton where he died of tuberculosis and was buried at st martin-in-the-fields on 16 & nbsp ; november 1779 . there is a statue and memorial plaque dedicated to chippendale outside the old grammar school gallery in manor square , in his home town of otley , near leeds , yorkshire . there is a full-size sculpted figure of thomas chippendale on the façade of the victoria and albert museum , london . work . after working as a journeyman cabinet maker in london , during 1754 , he became the first cabinet-maker to publish a book of his designs , titled the gentleman and cabinet maker 's director . three editions were published , the first in 1754 , followed by a virtual reprint in 1755 , and finally a revised and enlarged edition in 1762 , by which time chippendale 's illustrated designs began to show signs of neoclassicism . chippendale had considerable competition during his active years , most notably by ince and mayhew . notable works . chippendale was much more than just a cabinet maker , he was an interior designer who advised on other aspects of decor such as soft furnishings and even the colour a room should be painted . during the company 's period of greatest success it could act like a modern interior designer working with other specialists and contract for the supply of fully decorated and furnished rooms or whole houses , once the principal construction was done . chippendale often received large-scale commissions from aristocratic clients . twenty-six of these commissions have been identified . here furniture by chippendale can still be seen . the locations include : nostell priory , yorkshire , for sir roland winn , bt ( 1766–85 ) ;
