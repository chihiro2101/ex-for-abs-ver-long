Caroline Islands

description . the group consists of about 500 small coral islands , east of the philippines , in the pacific ocean . the distance from yap ( one of the larger caroline islands ) to manila is . most of the islands are made up of low , flat atoll , but there are some that rise high above sea level . people and culture . the indigenous inhabitants speak a variety of languages , including : the micronesian languages of pohnpeian , chuukese , carolinian , and kosraean ; the western malayo-polynesian languages of palauan and chamorro ; and the unclassified language yapese ( possibly one of the admiralty islands languages ) . there are also a significant number of inhabitants who belong to non-indigenous ethnic groups and speak other languages , including filipinos and japanese . the lingua franca used for trade and commerce among islanders who do not speak each other ’ s languages is english . the indigenous people of these islands live mainly on horticultural products , fish , many different varieties of bananas , and taro ( either the '' swamp '' or the '' purple '' kind ) . on some islands , housing is still built using local materials such as coconut-palm thatch . as a result of missionary work over the centuries , christianity is the religion most commonly practiced in this region of micronesia . nevertheless , many of the indigenous people adhere to the traditional belief in a supreme being called “ yalafar ” and an evil spirit called “ can . ” for the most part , however , they do not engage in traditional religious rites . the micronesian navigator mau piailug ( 1932-2010 ) was originally from the carolinian island of satawal . he learned the traditional navigation techniques of the weriyeng school , which had been preserved after other traditional techniques had been forgotten ( due partly to the remoteness of the carolinian islands ) . in the 1970s , mau shared his knowledge with members of the polynesian voyaging society . this led to a revival of the practices of traditional polynesian navigation techniques , and provided anthropologists with a greater understanding of the history of the polynesian and micronesian peoples . in 1985 , a study was published that examined the origin of the sidereal compass used in the caroline islands . halpern , m . d . ( 1985 ) '' the origins of the carolinian sidereal compass '' , master 's thesis , texas a & m university . history . different islands in the carolines have passed down different legends about the origins and early histories of their peoples . for example , on pohnpei , the islanders describe their history before colonial times as divided into three eras : the mwehin kawa or mwehin aramas ( era of building or peopling , before 1100 ) ; the mwehin sau deleur ( era of the reigns of the saudeleur , from 1100 to around 1628 ) ; and the mwehin nahnmwarki ( era of the tribal chiefs , from around 1628 to 1885 , when spain colonized the islands ) . according to pohnpeian legend : the saudeleur rulers originally came from beyond the islands ; they were the first to bring government to pohnpei ; they imposed absolute , centralized rule on the islanders , which became increasingly oppressive over the centuries ; and their arbitrary and onerous demands , along with their offenses against pohnpeian deities , sowed resentment among pohnpeians . legend has it that the saudeleur dynasty ended when another another foreigner , called isokelekel , invaded the islands , overthrew the saudeleurs , and instituted the more decentralized nahnmwarki ( tribal chief ) system ( which was maintained even during the later colonial period , and still exists today ) . . spanish overseas province . the first contact that spanish explorers had with the caroline islands was in 1525 , when a summer storm carried the portuguese navigators diogo da rocha and gomes de sequeira eastward from the moluccas ( by way of celebes ) . they ended up reaching several of the caroline islands and staying there for several months , until january 20 , 1526 . soon after , on august 22 , 1526 , the spain explorers alonso de salazar and diego de saavedra arrived in the area and recorded sighting the island of san bartolomé ( taongui ) . about 8 months later , on 1 january 1528 , the explorer álvaro de saavedra cerón claimed possession of the ulithi islands on behalf of the king of spain . spanish explorers visited the archipelago again in 1542 ( matelotes islands ) , 1543 , and 1545 . in 1565 , the islands were briefly visited by the first governor-general of the philippines , miguel lopez de legazpi ( in office from 1565 to 1572 ) . europeans did not visit the island again until 1686 , when francisco de lezcano arrived in yap . he called the islands las carolinas , in honor of charles ii of spain . this name was later extended to include the palau islands and the archipelagos that british explorers , visiting them a century later ( between 1788 and 1799 ) would come to call the gilbert islands and the marshall islands . ( spaniards today call the caroline islands islas de las hermanas , hombres pintados , and los jardines . ) a spanish royal decree , issued on october 19 , 1707 , authorized spanish missionaries to make several expeditions to the caroline islands . however , in 1731 , one such missionary , juan antonio cantova , was killed . as a result , spain ceased relations with the caroline islands . when they resumed relations in 1787 , their emphasis was on trade and commerce . josé saínz ramírez . colonial empires . nacional , 1942 , madrid in 1852 , a spanish colonel named coello suggested to the spanish government that effective spanish occupation of the caroline islands would help the spanish engage in trade and commerce with the philippines , australia , new guinea , and the americas . his suggestion was ignored at first , but , in 1885 , a spanish government representative called butron signed an agreement with the tribal chiefs of koror and artingal establishing spanish sovereignty over the caroline islands . at that point , spain attempted to impose customs duties on commercial exchanges in the region . however , spain 's previous abandonment of the islands had allowed the establishment of german and british missions on the islands , and germany and the united kingdom carolines question . the european powers called on pope leo xiii to arbitrate this dispute . he decided that spain would have these rights on the islands west of the 164th meridian east , and germany would have these rights on the marshall islands . ( he also assigned germany the right to maintain a naval station in one of the caroline islands , but germany never exercised that right . ) josé saínz ramírez : colonial empires . nacional , 1942 , madrid . after the spanish–american war of 1898 , spain sold the carolines and the northern marianas to germany in the german–spanish treaty ( 1899 ) for 25 million pesetas ( the equivalent of 17 million goldmarks or nearly one million pounds sterling ) , while reserving to itself the right to establish a coal mine in the area . germany governed the archipelago as the karolinen , and administratively associated it with german new guinea . a resort for whalers . the islands were a popular resort for whaling ships in the 19th century . the first such vessel known to have visited was the london whaler britannia , which called at ngatik in december 1793 . robert langdon ( ed . ) where the whalers went : an index to the pacific ports and islands visited by american whalers ( and some other ships ) in the 19th century , canberra , pacific manuscripts bureau , p.10 . such vessels —from britain , the united states , australia and elsewhere - came for water , wood , and food and , sometimes , for men willing to serve as crewmen on the vessels . these ships stimulated commerce and were significant vectors for change ( both good and ill ) . the islands most commonly visited were kosrae , mokil , ngatik , pingelap and pohnpei . japanese colony . japan invaded and occupied the islands in 1914 , during world war i , installing two naval squadrons . the western carolines were under the squadron commanded by rear admiral matsumura tatsuo ( 1868–1932 ) ; the eastern carolines were under vice-admiral yamaya tanin ( 1866–1940 ) . in 1920 , after world war i , japan received a south pacific mandate to control the caroline and marshall islands . during world war ii , japan operated a large base at truk lagoon which it used for expansion into the southeastern pacific . in the latter years of that war , during the japanese withdrawal to the japanese home islands , the allies effectively neutralized truk in operation hailstone . after the war , the islands ( together with the marshall islands ) became trust territory of the pacific islands . the federated states of micronesia gained independence in 1986 , followed by palau in 1994 . colonial governors or officers . district officers ( from 1889 , styled bezirksamtmann ) : in the western caroline islands ( yap and palau and from 1907 saipan ) 29 june 1886 & nbsp ; – 18 ?
