Traffic (band)

history . traffic 's singer , keyboardist , and guitarist steve winwood was the lead singer for the spencer davis group at age 14 . the spencer davis group released four top ten singles and three top ten albums in the united kingdom , as well as two top ten singles in the united states . drummer/vocalist/lyricist jim capaldi and guitarist dave mason had both been in the hellions and deep feeling , while woodwinds player chris wood came out of locomotive . winwood , capaldi , mason , and wood met when they jammed together at the elbow room , a club in aston , birmingham . after winwood left the spencer davis group in april 1967 , the quartet formed traffic . capaldi came up with the name of the group while the four of them were waiting to cross the street in dorchester . soon thereafter , they rented a cottage near the rural village of aston tirrold , berkshire to write and rehearse new music . traffic signed to chris blackwell 's island records label ( where winwood 's elder brother muff , also a member of the spencer davis group , later became a record producer and executive ) , and their debut single '' paper sun '' became a uk hit in mid-1967 ( 4 canada ) . their second single , mason 's psych-pop '' hole in my shoe '' , was an even bigger hit ( 4 canada ) , and it became one of their best-known tracks . the band 's third single , '' here we go round the mulberry bush '' , was made for the soundtrack of the 1967 british feature film of the same name . their debut album was mr . fantasy , produced by jimmy miller , and like the singles , was a hit in the uk but not as big elsewhere , although it did reach number 88 in the us . traffic – billboard , allmusic . retrieved 11 august 2011 . mason left the group due to artistic differences steve winwood : english soul . ( 2011 ) tv . bbc4 . 2 march 2013 just after mr . fantasy was released , but rejoined for a few months of 1968 , black , johnny ( may 1997 ) . feature : steve winwood , mojo . long enough to contribute to a slim majority of the songs on their second album , traffic . released in 1968 , it included the original version of mason 's '' feelin ' alright '' , which was later recorded with great success by joe cocker and three dog night . winwood , wood , and capaldi wanted to take the group in a different direction , opting for a folk/blues style rather than their earlier psychedelic/eclectic rock sound , while mason was oriented towards psychedelic pop . mason also cited discomfort with the traffic lifestyle . the band toured the us as a trio in late 1968 , which led to the following year 's release of traffic 's next album , last exit , one side of which was recorded live . during 1968 winwood and wood often played with jimi hendrix , and they both appear on the jimi hendrix experience 's 1968 double album electric ladyland , as did an uncredited mason . the band was dissolved by winwood 's leaving in early 1969 . his departure went unexplained at the time , even to capaldi and wood , but he later said '' because of the way i ended the spencer davis group , i saw no reason why i should n't leave traffic and move on . it seemed to me a normal thing to do . '' winwood 's comments clash with the fact that the davis group continued after he left . winwood then formed the supergroup blind faith , which lasted less than a year , recording one album and undertaking one us tour . the remaining members of traffic began a project with mick weaver ( a.k.a . wynder k . frog ) , the short-lived mason , capaldi , wood and frog ( later shortened to wooden frog ) , which played a few live dates and recorded some bbc sessions , but broke up before releasing any formal recordings . after the break-up of blind faith in 1969 , winwood began working on a solo recording , bringing in wood and capaldi to contribute , and the project eventually turned into a new traffic album , john barleycorn must die , their most successful album yet . traffic went on to expand its lineup late in 1970 , adding winwood 's former blind faith bandmate ric grech on bass . the group further expanded in 1971 with drummer jim gordon of derek and the dominos and ghanaian percussionist rebop kwaku baah . the live album welcome to the canteen was released in september and marked the band 's break with united artists records . it did not bear the '' traffic '' name on the cover , and instead was credited to the band 's individual members including mason , who returned for his third and final spell with the band . the album ended with a version of the spencer davis group song '' gim me some loving '' , which became a minor hit . following the departure of mason , traffic released the low spark of high heeled boys ( 1971 ) , which was a top 10 american album but did not chart in the uk . it sold over half a million copies in 1972 when it received a gold disc , and was awarded a r.i.a.a . platinum disc in march 1976 for over a million total sales . once again , however , personnel problems wracked the band as grech and gordon left the band in december 1971 , joynson , vernon ( 1995 ) . the tapestry of delights . london : borderline books . and the month after , winwood 's struggles with peritonitis brought traffic to a standstill . jim capaldi used this hiatus to record a solo album , oh how we danced , capaldi , jim ( 1983 ) . '' the ends of traffic , soloing & brazil '' , fierce heart press kit . which would prove to be the beginning of a long and successful solo career . the album included a surplus recording from the low spark of high-heeled boys , '' open your heart '' , and the new tracks featured drummer roger hawkins and bassist david hood , from the muscle shoals sound studio house band . capaldi soon brought them on board to replace grech and gordon . the new lineup ( winwood , capaldi , wood , kwaku baah , hawkins , hood ) toured america in early 1972 to promote the lp , and their concert at the santa monica civic auditorium on 21 february was recorded in multitrack audio and captured on colour videotape with multiple cameras . the 64-minute performance is thought to be the only extended live footage of the group . it was evidently not broadcast on television at the time , but was later released on home video and dvd . following winwood 's recovery from peritonitis , traffic 's sixth studio album , shoot out at the fantasy factory , released in 1973 , met with a cold critical reception , but in sales it was another major hit . it was shortly followed by a major world tour , from which the double live album , on the road , was drawn . it broke the band 's string of british flops by reaching number 40 in the uk albums chart . traffic , official charts company . retrieved 11 august 2011 . however , these successes were soured by the departure of hawkins , hood , and kwaku baah at the end of the world tour , and by chris wood 's increasing problems with drug use and depression . bassist rosko gee replaced david hood , while capaldi switched back to drums . when the eagle flies , released in 1974 , was yet another top ten album in the us , and moderately successful in the uk . however , a subsequent tour of the us , while successful in terms of ticket sales , was emotionally exhausting for the band . capaldi later recalled '' rosko gee and i were the only ones in anything like normal shape . steve was having recurrent problems with the peritonitis , and chris 's body was suffering from chemical warfare . '' winwood ultimately passed his boiling point , walking off the stage in the middle of what would prove the band 's final show , in chicago . the following day he left the tour without a word to anyone , leaving the rest of the band waiting for him at the venue for that night 's scheduled performance . feeling winwood had been integral to traffic 's music , the remaining members opted not to continue the band without him . traffic 's break-up was followed by two compilations from united artists ( heavy traffic and more heavy traffic ) , both of which only drew from the first half of their output . steve winwood embarked on a solo career , while rosko gee and rebop kwaku baah joined german band can . kwaku baah died on stage from a cerebral hemorrhage in stockholm , sweden in 1983 , and capaldi dedicated his solo album fierce heart to his memory . chris wood also died that year from pneumonia . all the still living members of traffic 's most recent lineup reunited in 1994 for a one-off tour , after a fan left a voice mail message at bob weir 's ( of the grateful dead ) hotel in chicago during the 1992 '' scaring the children '' tour , and suggested it would be cool if traffic toured with the ( then grateful ) dead . traffic opened for the grateful dead during their summer tour . the flute/sax role on the tour was played by randall bramblett , who had worked extensively with steve winwood . mike mcevoy joined the line up playing keyboards , guitar and viola , and walfredo reyes , jr . played drums and percussion . winwood and capaldi recorded and released a new traffic album , far from home , with no involvement from the other four members . it broke the top 40 in both the uk and usa . the last great traffic jam , a double live album and dvd released in 2005 , documents the band 's 1994 reunion tour . the four original members of traffic were inducted for their contributions in the rock and roll hall of fame on 15 march 2004 . winwood , capaldi , mason , and stephanie wood ( standing in for her late brother chris ) all attended the ceremony . winwood and capaldi took part in the induction performance , but were joined by dave mason performing his song 'feelin ' alright ' for the grand finale which also featured keith richards , tom petty , and the temptations . the induction lineup was completed by bramblett on organ and bass pedals , even though he was not one of the members inducted .
