producer of chemicals in the world ( henry , 1974 ) . during world wari the government built an 80 million complex in nitro to manufacture explosives and chemicals for the war effort . the site was located on an cow pasture on the kanawha river on the flat river valley floodplain . the facility had just been placed in operation when the war ended in november 1918 . the first shipment of powder was also the last . local authorities then sought various chemical companies to occupy the facility which had excellent infrastructure in utilities , transportation and new housing for workers . it was hoped that the former gunpowder complex would become a major chemical manufacturing center , especially for the emerging dye industry in the u.s . that relied on coal and coke by-products as feedstock . the kanawha river and water in the adjacent alluvium have been adversely affected by industrial activities ( messinger , 1997 ) . the chemical manufacturing history of nitro resulted in
