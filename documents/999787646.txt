Thujone

sources . thujone is found in a number of plants , such as thuja ( genus thuja , hence the derivation of the name ) , nootka cypress , some junipers , mugwort , oregano , common sage , tansy , and wormwood , most notably grand wormwood ( artemisia absinthium ) , usually as a mix of isomers in a 1:2 ratio . it is also found in various species of mentha ( mint ) . biosynthesis . the biosynthesis of thujone is similar to the synthesis of other monoterpenes and begins with the formation of geranyl diphosphate ( gpp ) from dimethylallyl pyrophosphate ( dmapp ) and isopentenyl diphosphate ( ipp ) , catalyzed by the enzyme geranyl diphosphate synthase . quantitative 13 cnmr spectroscopic analysis has demonstrated that the isoprene rule used to form thujone in plants are derived from the mep pathway ( mep ) . the reactions that generate the thujane skeleton in sabinene from gpp are mediated by the enzyme sabinene synthase which has gpp as its substrate . gpp ( 1 ) first isomerizes to linalyl diphosphate ( lpp ) ( 2 ) and neryl diphosphate ( npp ) ( 3 ) . lpp preferentially forms a delocalized allylic cation-diphosphate ( 4 ) . the ion-pair intermediate then cyclizes in an electrophilic addition to yield the α-terpinyl tertiary cation ( 5 ) . the α-terpinyl cation ( 5 ) then undergoes a 1,2 hydride shift via a wagner-meerwein rearrangement , leading to the formation of the terpinen-4-yl cation ( 6 ) . this cation undergoes a second cyclization to form the thujyl cation intermediate ( 7 ) before loss of a proton to form the thujone precursor , sabinene ( 8 ) . from sabinene ( 8 ) , the proposed biosynthetic route to generate thujone follows a three-step pathway : sabinene is first oxidized to an isomer of ( + ) -sabinol ( 9-1,2 ) by a cytochrome p450 , followed by conversion to ( + ) -sabinone ( 10 ) via a dehydrogenase . finally , a reductase mediates the conversion to α-thujone ( 11-1 ) and β-thujone ( 11-2 ) . the isomerism of the ( + ) -sabinol intermediate varies among thujone-producing plants ; for instance , in the western redcedar ( thuja plicata ) , thujone is derived exclusively from the ( + ) -trans-sabinol intermediate ( 9-1 ) whereas in the garden sage ( salvia officinalis ) , thujone is formed from the ( + ) -cis-sabinol intermediate ( 9-2 ) . . pharmacology . based on studies that looked only at molecular shape , for many years thujone was thought to act similarly to thc on the cannabinoid receptors ; barnaby conrad iii ; ( 1988 ) . absinthe : history in a bottle . chronicle books . p . 152 however , this has since been proven false . thujone is a gaba a receptor antagonist and more specifically , a gabaa receptor . by inhibiting gaba receptor activation , neurons may fire more easily , which can cause muscle spasms and convulsions . this interaction with the gabaa receptor is specific to alpha-thujone . thujone is also a 5-ht3 antagonist . modulation of ionotropic gaba receptors by natural products of plant origin the median lethal dose , or ld 50 , of alpha-thujone , the more active of the two isomers , in mice , is around 45 & nbsp ; mg/kg , with 0 % mortality rate at 30 & nbsp ; mg/kg and 100 % at 60 & nbsp ; mg/kg . mice exposed to the higher dose have convulsions that lead to death within 1 minute . from 30 to 45 & nbsp ; mg/kg , the mice experience muscle spasms in the legs , which progress to general convulsions until death or recovery . these effects are in line with other gaba antagonists . also , alpha-thujone is metabolized quickly in the liver in mice . pretreatment with gaba positive allosteric modulators like diazepam , phenobarbital , or 1 g/kg of ethanol protects against a lethal dose of 100 & nbsp ; mg/kg . attention performance has been tested with low and high doses of thujone in alcohol . the high dose had a short-term negative effect on attention performance . the lower dose showed no noticeable effect . thujone is reported to be toxic to brain , kidney , and liver cells and could cause convulsions if used in too high a dose . other thujone-containing plants such as the tree thuja ( thuja occidentalis ) are used in herbal medicine , mainly for their immune-system stimulating effects . side effects from the essential oil of this plant include anxiety , sleeplessness , and convulsions , which confirms the central nervous system effects of thujone . . in absinthe . thujone is most famous for being a compound in the spirit absinthe . in the past , absinthe was thought to contain up to 260–350 & nbsp ; mg/l thujone , absinthism : a fictitious 19th-century syndrome with present impact , padosch et al . retrieved oct . 28 , 2006 . but modern tests have shown this estimate to be far too high . a 2008 study of 13 pre-ban ( 1895–1910 ) bottles using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( gc-ms ) found that the bottles had between 0.5 and 48.3 & nbsp ; mg/l and averaged 25.4 & nbsp ; mg/l absinthe myths finally laid to rest chemical composition of vintage preban absinthe with special reference to thujone , fenchone , pinocamphone , methanol , copper , and antimony concentrations a 2005 study recreated three 1899 high-wormwood recipes and tested with gc-ms , and found that the highest contained 4.3 & nbsp ; mg/l thujone . thujone—cause of absinthism ? lachenmeier , emmert et al . retrieved oct . 28 , 2006 . gc-ms testing is important in this capacity , because gas chromatography alone may record an inaccurately high reading of thujone as other compounds may interfere with and add to the apparent measured amount . determination of a-/b-thujone and related terpenes in absinthe using solid phase extraction and gas chromatography , emmert et al . retrieved oct . 28 , 2006 . . history . the compound was discovered after absinthe became popular in the mid-19th century . valentin_magnan , who studied alcoholism , tested pure wormwood oil on animals and discovered it caused seizures independent from the effects of alcohol . based on this , absinthe , which contains a small amount of wormwood oil , was assumed to be more dangerous than ordinary alcohol . eventually , thujone was isolated as the cause of these reactions . magnan went on to study 250 abusers of alcohol and noted that those who drank absinthe had seizures and hallucinations . the seizures are caused by the ( + ) -α-thujone interacting with the gaba receptors , causing epileptic activity . in light of modern evidence , these conclusions are questionable , as they are based on a poor understanding of other compounds and diseases , and clouded by magnan 's belief that alcohol and absinthe were degenerating the french race . barnaby conrad iii ;
