biography . early life . ernst jünger was born in heidelberg as the eldest of six children of the chemical engineer ernst georg jünger ( 1868–1943 ) and of karoline lampl ( 1873–1950 ) . two of his siblings died as infants . his father acquired some wealth in potash mining . he went to school in hannover from 1901 to 1905 , and during 1905 to 1907 to boarding schools in hanover and brunswick . he rejoined his family in 1907 , in rehburg , and went to school in wunstorf with his siblings from 1907 to 1912 . during this time , he developed his passion for adventure novels and for entomology . he spent some time as an exchange student in buironfosse , saint-quentin , france , in september 1909 . with his younger brother friedrich georg jünger ( 1898–1977 ) he joined the wandervogel movement in 1911 . his first poem was published with the gaublatt für hannoverland in november 1911 . heimo schwilk , klett-cotta , ernst jünger – ein jahrhundertleben , 2014 , chapter 3 . heimo schwilk ( ed . ) , ernst jünger : leben und werk in bildern und texten , klett-cotta , 2010 , p . 24 . by this time , jünger had a reputation as a budding bohemian poet . heimo schwilk ( ed . ) , ernst jünger : leben und werk in bildern und texten , klett-cotta , 2010 , p . 27 . in 1913 , jünger was a student at the hamelin gymnasium . in november , he travelled to verdun and enlisted in the french foreign legion for five years . stationed in a training camp at sidi bel abbès , algeria , he deserted and travelled to morocco , but was captured and returned to camp . six weeks later , he was dismissed from the legion due to the intervention of the german foreign office , at the request of his father , on the grounds of being a minor . jünger was now sent to a boarding school in hanover , where he was seated next to the future communist leader werner scholem ( 1895–1940 ) . world war i . on 1 august 1914 , shortly after the start of world war i , jünger volunteered with the 73rd infantry regiment albrecht von preussen of the hannoverian 19th division and after training was transported to the champagne front in december . he was wounded for the first time in april 1915 . during convalescence , he decided to enlist as an officer aspirant ( fahnenjunker ) , and he was promoted to lieutenant on 27 november 1915 . as platoon leader , he gained a reputation for his combat exploits and initiative in offensive patrolling and reconnaissance . during the battle of the somme near the obliterated remains of the village of guillemont his platoon took up a front line position in a defile that had been shelled until it consisted of little more than a dip strewn with the rotting corpses of predecessors . he wrote : the platoon was relieved but jünger was wounded by shrapnel in the rest area of combles and hospitalized ; his platoon reoccupied the position on the eve of the battle of guillemont and was obliterated in a british offensive . original casualty report , published 4 october 1916 , p . 15,280 . he was wounded for the third time in november 1916 , and awarded the iron cross in january 1917 . in the spring of 1917 , he was promoted to command of 7th company and stationed at cambrai . transferred to langemarck in july , jünger 's actions against the advancing british included forcing retreating soldiers to join his resistance line at gunpoint . he arranged the evacuation of his brother friedrich georg , who had been wounded . in the battle of cambrai ( 1917 ) jünger sustained two wounds , by a bullet passing through his helmet at the back of the head , and another by a shell fragment on the forehead . he was awarded the house order of hohenzollern . while advancing to take up positions just before ludendorff 's operation michael on 19 march 1918 , jünger was forced to call a halt after the guides lost their way , and while bunched together half of his company were lost to a direct hit from artillery . jünger himself survived , and led the survivors as part of a successful advance but was wounded twice towards the end of the action , being shot in the chest and less seriously across the head . after convalescing , he returned to his regiment in june , sharing a widespread feeling that the tide had now turned against germany and victory was impossible . on 25 august , he was wounded for the seventh and final time near favreuil , being shot through the chest while leading his company in an advance that was quickly overwhelmed by a british counter-attack . becoming aware the position he was lying was falling , jünger rose , and as his lung drained of the blood spurting through the wound , recovered enough to escape in the confused situation . he made his way to a machine-gun post that was holding out , where a doctor told him to lie down immediately . carried to the rear in a tarpaulin , he and the bearers came under fire , and the doctor was killed . a soldier who tried to carry jünger on his shoulders was killed after a few yards , but another took his place . jünger received the wound badge . while he was treated in a hannover hospital , on 22 september he received notice of being awarded the pour le mérite on the recommendation of division commander johannes von busse . pour le mérite , the highest military decoration of the german empire , was awarded some 700 times during the war , but almost exclusively to high-ranking officers ( and seventy times to combat pilots ) ; jünger was one of only eleven infantry company leaders receiving the order . helmuth kiesel , ernst jünger : die biographie , siedler verlag , 2009 . throughout the war , jünger kept a diary , which became the basis of his 1920 storm of steel . he spent his free time reading the works of nietzsche , schopenhauer , ariosto and kubin , besides entomological journals he was sent from home . during 1917 , he was collecting beetles in the trenches and while on patrol , 149 specimens between 2 january and 27 july , which he listed under the title of fauna coleopterologica douchyensis ( '' coleopterology fauna of the douchy region '' ) . . interwar period . jünger served as a lieutenant in the army of the weimar republic until his demobilisation in 1923 . he studied marine biology , zoology , botany , and philosophy , and became a well-known entomologist . in germany , an important entomological prize is named after him : the ernst-jünger-preis für entomologie . : de : ernst-jünger-preis für entomologie his war experiences described in storm of steel ( german title : in stahlgewittern ) , which jünger self-published in 1920 , gradually made him famous . he married gretha von jeinsen ( 1906–60 ) in 1925 . they had two children , ernst jr . ( 1926–44 ) and alexander ( 1934–93 ) . he criticized the fragile and unstable democracy of the weimar republic , stating that he '' hated democracy like the plague . '' more explicitly than in storm of steel , he portrayed war as a mystical experience that revealed the nature of existence . according to jünger , the essence of the modern was found in total mobilisation for military effectiveness , which tested the capacity of the human senses . in 1932 , he published the worker ( german title : der arbeiter ) , which called for the creation of an activist society run by warrior-worker-scholars . in the essay on pain , written and published in 1934 , jünger rejects the liberal values of liberty , security , ease , and comfort , and seeks instead the measure of man in the capacity to withstand pain and sacrifice . around this time his writing included the aphorism '' what does n't kill me makes me stronger ; and what kills me makes me incredibly strong . '' michael hoffman 's introduction to storm of steel . third reich . as a famous war hero and prominent nationalist critic of the weimar republic , the ascendant nazi party ( nsdap ) courted jünger as a natural ally , but jünger rejected such advances . when jünger moved to berlin in 1927 , he rejected an offer of a seat in the reichstag for the nsdap . in 1930 , he openly denounced hitler 's suppression of the rural people 's movement . peter longerich : jünger , ernst , schriftsteller . in : wolfgang benz , hermann graml ( hrsg . ) : biographisches lexikon zur weimarer republik . c . h . beck , münchen 1988 , 164f . in the 22 october 1932 edition of völkischer beobachter , the article '' das endlose dialektische gespräch '' ( '' the never-ending dialectical debate '' ) attacked jünger for his rejection of the '' blood and soil '' doctrine , accusing him of being an '' intellectualist '' and a liberal . jünger again refused a seat offered to him in the reichstag following the nazi party 's machtergreifung in january 1933 , and he refused the invitation to head the german academy of literature ( die deutsche akademie der dichtung ) . on 14 june 1934 , jünger wrote a '' letter of rejection '' to the völkischer beobachter , the official nazi newspaper , in which he requested that none of his writings be published in it . jünger also refused to speak on joseph goebbels 's radio . he was one of the few '' nationalist '' authors whose names were never found on the frequent declarations of loyalty to hitler . he and his brother friedrich georg quit the '' traditionsverein der 73er '' ( veteran 's organization of the hanoverian regiment they had served during world war i ) when its jewish members were expelled . when jünger left berlin in 1933 , his house was searched several times by the gestapo . on the marble cliffs ( 1939 , german title : auf den marmorklippen ) , a short novel in the form of a parable , uses metaphor to describe jünger 's negative perceptions of the situation in hitler 's germany . he served in world war ii as an army captain . assigned to an administrative position as intelligence officer and mail censor in paris , he socialized ( often at the georges v hotel or at maxim 's ) with prominent artists of the day such as picasso and jean cocteau . he also went to the salons of marie-louise bousquet and florence gould . he passed on information e.g . about upcoming transports '' at an acceptable level of risk '' which saved jewish lives . his office was in the hotel majestic and he was billeted at the hotel raphael . his early time in france is described in his diary gärten und strassen ( 1942 , gardens and streets ) . he was also given the task of executing a german deserter who had beaten the women sheltering him and been turned in . jünger considered avoiding the assignment but eventually attended to oversee the execution in , as he claimed in his journal , 'the spirit of higher curiosity' . citing gerhard heller , un allemand à paris . jünger appears on the fringes of the july 20 plot . he was clearly an inspiration to anti-nazi conservatives in the german army , and while in paris he was close to the old , mostly prussian , officers who carried out the assassination attempt against hitler . on 6 june 1944 jünger went to rommel 's headquarters at la roche-guyon , arriving late at about 9pm as the bridge at mantes was down . present were rommel 's chief-of-staff hans speidel , general wagener , colonel list , consul pfieffer , reporter major wilhelm von schramm and speidel 's brother-in-law dr max horst ( rommel was in germany ) . at 9.30 pm they went to spieidel 's quarters to discuss '' der friede '' ( the peace ) , jünger 's 30-page peace proposal ( written in 1943 ) , to be given to the allies after hitler 's demise or removal from power ; also proposed is a united europe . he returned about midnight . the next day at paris hq jünger was stunned by the news of the invasion . jünger was only peripherally involved in the events , however , and in the aftermath suffered only dismissal from the army in august 1944 rather than execution . he was saved by the chaos of the last months of the war , and by always being '' inordinately careful '' , burning writing on sensitive matters from 1933 . one source ( friedrich hielscher ) claimed that hitler said '' nothing happens to jünger '' . his elder son ernst jr . , then an eighteen-year-old naval ( kriegsmarine ) cadet , was imprisoned that year for engaging in '' subversive discussions '' in his wilhelmshaven naval academy ( a capital offence ) . transferred to penal unit 999 as frontbewahrung after his parents had spoken to the presiding judge admiral scheurlen , he was killed near carrara in occupied italy on 29 november 1944 ( though jünger was never sure whether he had been shot by the enemy or by the ss ) . . post-war period . after the war , jünger was initially under some suspicion for his nationalist past , and he was banned from publishing in germany for four years by the british occupying forces because he refused to submit to the denazification procedures . his work the peace ( german title : der friede ) , written in 1943 and published abroad in 1947 , marked the end of his involvement in politics . when german communists threatened his safety in 1945 , bertolt brecht instructed them to '' leave jünger alone . '' his public image rehabilitated by the 1950s , he went on to be regarded as a towering figure of german literature . west german publisher klett put out a ten-volume collected works ( werke ) in 1965 , extended to 18 volumes 1978–1983 . this made jünger one of just four german authors to see two subsequent editions of their collected works published during their lifetime , alongside goethe , klopstock and wieland . his diaries from 1939 to 1949 were published under the title strahlungen ( 1948 , reflections ) . in the 1950s and 1960s , jünger travelled extensively . his first wife , gretha , died in 1960 , and in 1962 he married liselotte lohrer . he continued writing prodigiously for his entire life , publishing more than 50 books . martin heidegger was heavily influenced by jünger 's the worker although he did not regard jünger as a philosopher . heidegger 's interpretation of jünger 's work is compiled in volume 90 of his complete edition , titled '' zu ernst jünger '' . jünger was among the forerunners of magical realism . his vision in the glass bees ( 1957 , german title : gläserne bienen ) , of a future in which an automated machine-driven world threatens individualism , could be seen as a story within the science fiction genre . a sensitive poet with training in botany and zoology , as well as a soldier , his works in general are infused with tremendous details of the natural world . throughout his life he had experimented with drugs such as ether , cocaine , and hashish ; and later in life he used mescaline and lsd . these experiments were recorded comprehensively in annäherungen ( 1970 , approaches ) . the novel visit to godenholm ( 1952 , visit to godenholm ) is clearly influenced by his early experiments with mescaline and lsd . he met with lsd inventor albert hofmann and they took lsd together several times . hofmann 's memoir lsd , my problem child describes some of these meetings . . later life . one of the most important contributions of jünger 's later literary production is the metahistoric figure of the anarch , an ideal figure of a self-ownership , conceived in his novel eumeswil ( 1977 ) , which evolved from his earlier conception of the waldgänger , or '' forest fleer '' by influence of max stirner 's conception of the unique ( der einzige ) . warrior , waldgänger , anarch : an essay on ernst jünger 's concept of the sovereign individual by abdalbarr braun , accessed 22 december 2007 . ernst jünger – anarch an exposition of the figure of the anarch through citations from juenger 's eumeswil . ] in 1981 , jünger was awarded the prix mondial cino del duca . jünger was immensely popular in france , where at one time 48 of his translated books were in print . in 1984 , he spoke at the verdun memorial , alongside his admirers , french president françois mitterrand and the german chancellor , where he called the '' ideology of war '' in germany before and after world war i '' a calamitous mistake '' . although he had been cleared of the accusation of any fascist or nazi sympathies since the 1950s , and he never showed any sympathy to the political style of '' blood and soil '' popular in the third reich , jünger 's national conservatism and his ongoing role as conservative philosopher and icon made him a controversial figure in the eyes of the german marxist left , and huyssen ( 1993 ) argued that nevertheless '' his conservative literature made nazism highly attractive '' , and that '' the ontology of war depicted in storm of steel could be interpreted as a model for a new , hierarchically ordered society beyond democracy , beyond the security of bourgeois society and ennui '' . marxist writer and critic walter benjamin wrote '' theories of german fascism '' ( 1930 ) as a review of war and warrior , a collection of essays edited by jünger . english translation : despite the ongoing political criticism of his work , jünger said he never regretted anything he wrote , nor would he ever take it back . his younger son alexander , a physician , committed suicide in 1993 . jünger 's 100th birthday on 29 march 1995 was met with praise from many quarters , including the socialist french president françois mitterrand . death . jünger came from an agnostic family and did not hold to any particular belief in god , yet shortly before he died he converted to roman catholicism . standing against tyranny , first things . a year before the end of his long life ( 1895–1998 ) , the german author ernst jünger converted to catholicism , a late change on a tumultuous path of searching and adventures that were far from exclusively spiritual . born into a protestant family , he attended conventional boarding schools , but at the age of eighteen ran away to france to join the foreign legion . a year before his death , jünger was received into the catholic church and began to receive the sacraments . laska , bernd a .
