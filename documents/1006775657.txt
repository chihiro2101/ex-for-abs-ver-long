Biophilia hypothesis

natural affinity for living systems . '' biophilia '' is an innate affinity of life or living systems . the term was first used by erich fromm to describe a erich fromm of being attracted to all that is alive and vital . wilson uses the term in a related sense when he suggests that biophilia describes '' the connections that human beings subconsciously seek with the rest of life . '' he proposed the possibility that the deep affiliations humans have with other life forms and nature as a whole are rooted in our biology . both positive and negative ( including phobic ) affiliations toward natural objects ( species , phenomenon ) as compared to artificial objects are evidence for biophilia . although named by fromm , the concept of biophilia has been proposed and defined many times over . aristotle was one of many to put forward a concept that could be summarized as '' love of life '' . diving into the term philia , or friendship , aristotle evokes the idea of reciprocity and how friendships are beneficial to both parties in more than just one way , but especially in the way of happiness . santas , aristotelis .

'' sanzaro applies wilson 's theories to trends in artificial intelligence and psychoanalysis and argues that technology is not an antithesis to nature , but simply another form of seeking intimacy with nature .
