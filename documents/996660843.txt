Mark Pattison (academic)

life . he was the son of the rector of hauxwell , yorkshire , and was privately educated by his father , mark james pattison . his sister was dorothy wyndlow pattison ( '' sister dora '' ) . miss w . r . probert , walsall 's own 'lady with the lamp ' , the blackcountryman , spring 2007 , vol . 40 , no . 2 , p . 51 . in 1832 , he matriculated at oriel college , oxford , where he took his b.a . degree in 1836 with second-class honours . after other attempts to obtain a fellowship , he was elected in 1839 to a yorkshire fellowship at lincoln college , oxford , an anti-puseyite college . pattison was at this time a puseyite , and greatly under the influence of john henry newman , for whom he worked , helping in the translation of thomas aquinas 's catena aurea , and writing in the british critic and christian remembrancer . he was ordained priest in 1843 , and in the same year became tutor of lincoln college , where he rapidly made a reputation as a clear and stimulating teacher and as a sympathetic friend of youth . the management of the college was practically in his hands , and his reputation as a scholar became high in the university . in 1851 the rectorship of lincoln became vacant , and it seemed certain that pattison would be elected , but he was edged out . the disappointment was acute and his health suffered . in 1855 , he resigned the tutorship , travelled to germany to investigate continental systems of education , and began his researches into the lives of isaac casaubon and joseph justus scaliger , which occupied the remainder of his life . in 1861 , he was at last elected rector of lincoln college in oxford , marrying in the same year lady dilke ( afterwards lady dilke ) . as rector , he contributed largely to various reviews on literary subjects , and took a considerable interest in social science , even presiding over a section at a congress in 1876 . however , he avoided the routine of university business , and refused the vice-chancellorship . but while living the life of a student , he was fond of society , and especially of the society of women . he died at harrogate , yorkshire . his biography of isaac casaubon appeared in 1875 ; he also wrote about john milton in macmillan 's '' english men of letters '' series in 1879 . the late nineteenth century english author george gissing wrote in his diary in 1891 that he 'was astonished to find the biography of casaubon on the shelves ' of a circulating library in the small north somerset seaside resort of clevedon . coustillas , { pierre ed . london and the life of literature in late victorian england : the diary of george gissing , novelist . brighton : harvester press , 1978 , p.250 . the 18th century , alike in its literature and its theology , was a favourite study , as is illustrated by his contribution ( tendencies of religious thought in england , 1688–1750 ) to the once famous essays and reviews ( 1860 ) , and by his edition of pope 's essay on man ( 1869 ) , etc . his sermons and collected essays , edited by henry nettleship , were published posthumously ( 1889 ) , as well as the memoirs ( 1885 ) , an autobiography deeply tinged with melancholy and bitterness . his projected life of scaliger was never finished . publications .
