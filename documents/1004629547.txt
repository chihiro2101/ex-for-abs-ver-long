Alexander Korda

personal background . alexander korda was born sándor lászló kellner into a jewish family in túrkeve , austria-hungary . his parents were henrik kellner and ernesztina weisz . he had two younger brothers , zoltan and vincent , who also had careers in the film industry , often working with alexander . early career in european silent film . films in hungary . after the death of his father korda began writing film reviews to support his family . he also changed the family name , deriving the new name korda from the latin phrase '' sursum corda '' ( '' lift up your hearts '' ) . having been excused from military service in the austro-hungarian army in the first world war , because he was myopia , korda became an important figure in the hungarian film industry , initially through his magazines pesti mozi , mozihét and világ . this led to invitations to write screenplays . his first script was for watchhouse in the carpathians ( 1914 ) , which he also helped to direct . kulik , p . 13 he also made a film with gyula zilahy , the duped journalist ( 1914 ) , and directed tutyu and totyo ( 1915 ) , the officer 's swordknot ( 1915 ) and lyon lea ( 1915 ) . kulik , p . 14 in 1916 korda established his own production company , corvin film . its first film was white nights ( 1916 ) , which was a big success . korda went on to build corvin into one of the largest film companies in hungary with such productions as the grandmother ( 1916 ) , tales of the typewriter ( 1916 ) , the man with two hearts ( 1916 ) , the one million pound note ( 1916 ) , cyclamen ( 1916 ) , struggling hearts ( 1916 ) , the laughing saskia ( 1916 ) , miska the magnate ( 1916 ) , st . peter 's umbrella ( 1917 ) , the stork caliph ( 1917 ) ( from the novel by mihály babits ) , and magic ( 1917 ) . korda later regarded harrison and barrison ( 1917 ) as his best film . he also made faun ( 1918 ) , man of gold ( 1918 ) , and mary ann ( 1918 ) . under the shortlived hungarian soviet republic korda made ave caesar ! ( 1919 ) , white rose ( 1919 ) , yamata ( 1919 ) and neither at home or abroad ( 1919 ) . his final hungarian film was number 111 ( 1919 ) . in october 1919 korda was arrested during the white terror that followed the overthrow of the communist government , but was soon released . he then left hungary for austria . he never returned to his country of birth . kulik , pp . 26–27 . films in vienna . after leaving hungary , korda accepted an invitation from count alexander kolowrat to work for his company sascha-film in the austrian capital vienna . kulik , pp . 27–29 korda worked alongside kolowrat , who had attracted several leading hungarian and german directors into his employment , on the historical epic the prince and the pauper ( 1920 ) . the film was a major international success and inspired korda with the idea of making '' international films '' with global box office appeal . kulik , pp . 30–31 korda 's next two films , masters of the sea ( 1922 ) and a vanished world ( 1922 ) , were both nautical-set adventures based on hungarian novels . by that stage , korda had grown irritated with kolowrat 's interference with his work and left sascha to make an independent film , samson and delilah ( 1922 ) , set in the world of opera . the film was made on a lavish scale , with large crowd scenes . the lengthy shooting schedule lasted 160 working days . the film was unsuccessful . kulik , pp . 32–34 . films in berlin . korda left vienna and travelled to germany . he had frequent problems with money , and often had to receive support from friends and business associates , but in berlin he raised funding for the melodrama the unknown tomorrow ( 1923 ) . with backing from germany 's biggest film company , ufa , korda returned to vienna to make everybody 's woman ( 1924 ) . while he was there he began work on his next film , the historical tragedy in the house of habsburg ( 1924 ) , which portrayed the mayerling incident . it earned back around half of its production costs . kulik , p . 39 he followed this with dancing mad ( 1925 ) , another melodrama . korda cast his wife maria corda sic as the female lead in all his german-language films . to a large degree the success of his productions depended on her star power . korda cast her again in a modern dubarry ( 1927 ) , an update of the life of madame du barry based on an original screenplay by lajos bíró . the film may have been intended to showcase maria corda 's star potential to producers in hollywood . kulik , p . 40 korda made his final german film , madame wants no children ( 1926 ) , for the berlin-based subsidiary of the american studio fox . although made later , it was released before a modern dubarry . in hollywood and france . in december 1926 korda and his wife sailed for the united states on board the steamer olympic , with a view to korda taking up a contract with the american studio first national . kulik , pp . 41–42 in hollywood both struggled to adapt to the studio system . korda had to wait some time before gaining his first directorial assignment , the stolen bride ( 1927 ) , a hungarian-themed romance about a peasant 's love for a countess . kulik , p . 45 the film starred the american actress billie dove rather than korda 's wife . following the moderate success of the stolen bride korda worked on the comedy the private life of helen of troy ( 1927 ) , replacing the previous director , george fitzmaurice . the film retells the story of helen of troy , parodying the historical epics of the era by transforming the classical characters into everyday people with modern problems . the film was a significant success for korda , with his wife playing the role of helen . the film was his most satisfying work in the united states and provided the template for his later success in britain . after this film , however , korda became pigeonholed as a director of female stars and exotic foreign locations . he was generally given similar assignments for the remainder of his first period in hollywood . kulik , p . 48 his next few films were disappointments as his career lost its momentum : yellow lily ( 1928 ) , night watch ( 1928 ) both with dove , and love and the devil ( 1929 ) with maria korda ( who now spelled her name with a k ) . the latter two , though still silent films , had sound effects and music added to their soundtracks during hollywood 's transition to fully synchronized sound films . korda 's next film the squall ( 1929 ) , with a young myrna loy , was his first talkie and featured a hungarian setting . although , like many other directors , korda had misgivings about the new technology , he quickly adapted to making sound films . korda 's marriage was strained in hollywood . the arrival of sound films wrecked his wife 's career , as her heavy accent made her unemployable for most american films . love and the devil was the last of korda 's films she appeared in , and she made only two more films . she became increasingly resentful of the switch in their relationship , as her career was now over while korda , who had once relied on her for the success of his films , was relatively flourishing . their marriage collapsed , and they divorced in 1930 . kulik , pp . 49–50 korda made two more sound films at first national : her private life ( 1929 ) and lilies of the field ( 1930 ) , both of which were remakes of earlier silent films . korda grew more frustrated in hollywood as he came to strongly dislike the studio system . he hoped to save up enough money to return to europe and begin producing on a large scale there , but his lavish personal spending and the large amounts he lost in the wall street crash prevented this . when his producer , ned marin , moved from first national to the fox film corporation korda followed him . korda 's new contract gave him 100,000 a year . kulik , p . 52 . fox . his first film for fox , women everywhere ( 1930 ) , cost slightly more than some of the b movie he had previously directed in the united states . he collaborated with several figures who would contribute to his future success in britain . korda was offered a series of scripts , all of which he disliked , before he finally agreed to make the princess and the plumber ( 1930 ) . kulik , pp . 54–55 korda 's reluctance to make the film led to his conflict with studio bosses , which brought to an end his first period in hollywood . films in france . korda went to france where he made the men around lucy ( 1931 ) for paramount . he also made rive gauche ( 1931 ) . korda had a success with marius ( 1931 ) starring raimu from the play by marcel pagnol . he followed it with längtan till havet ( 1932 ) , and the golden anchor ( 1932 ) . in britain . korda relocated to london where he made service for ladies ( 1932 ) for paramount . he produced women who play ( 1932 ) for them . london films . korda then decided to form his own company . in 1932 he founded london films . its first production was wedding rehearsal ( 1932 ) . he then produced men of tomorrow ( 1932 ) , co-directed by his brother zoltan korda , that night in london ( 1932 ) starring robert donat , strange evidence ( 1933 ) , counsel 's opinion ( 1933 ) , and cash ( 1933 ) . the private life of henry viii . korda had a huge hit with the private life of henry viii ( 1933 ) , which he directed . it was nominated for the academy award for best picture , established korda internationally and made a star of charles laughton . after the private life of henry viii . korda followed it with the girl from maxim 's ( 1933 ) , which he shot in english and french . he tried to repeat the success of henry with the private life of don juan ( 1934 ) starring douglas fairbanks , which he directed , and the rise of catherine the great ( 1934 ) which he did not . neither did as well as henry . korda produced a well-respected short , the private life of the gannets ( 1934 ) , and enjoyed a big success as producer of the scarlet pimpernel ( 1934 ) . also popular was sanders of the river ( 1935 ) starring paul robeson and directed by his brother , and the ghost goes west ( 1936 ) starring donat . his other credits as producer include moscow nights ( 1936 ) with laurence olivier , men are not gods ( 1936 ) , and forget me not ( 1936 ) . korda directed rembrandt ( 1936 ) with laughton , which was a critical rather than a commercial success . things to come ( 1936 ) , directed by william cameron menzies , has come to be regarded as a classic . it was written by h.g . wells and korda 's the man who could work miracles ( 1936 ) is based on a wells short story . korda also commissioned and financed the documentary conquest of the air ( 1936 ) . denham . korda bought property in denham , buckinghamshire , including hills house , and built film studios on the property . london film 's denham film studios was financed by the prudential and opened in 1936 . on 21 june 1936 , thurston macauley , london correspondent to the new york times , filed a story headlined '' the korda workshop at denham '' describing the facility , located on 165 acres of woodland , field and river scenery suitable for filming , with 28 acres of buildings and a planned total of fifteen 250-foot by 130-foot sound stages ( state of the art at the time ) . it was '' not only the most up-to-date of all the world 's studios '' but a '' complete community in itself '' from foundry and blacksmith 's shops to projection theatres , with '' unusually good dressing and bathroom accommodations '' and able to easily manage crowds of 500 . macauley pointed to the special construction designed to ensure that even dense fog would not penetrate the buildings and interfere with filming , a serious problem in britain in the winter months . he concluded : '' hollywood , as well as the rest of the world , will be watching with interest what korda does at denham '' . korda was naturalised as a british subject on 28 october 1936 . that same year korda was an important contributor to the moyne commission , formed to protect british film production from competition , mainly from the united states . korda said : '' if american interests obtained control of british production companies , they may make british pictures here , but the pictures made would be just as american as those made in hollywood . we are now on the verge of forming a british school of film-making in this country . '' quoted from terramedia website 2009 korda produced fire over england ( 1937 ) with olivier and vivien leigh . he also attempted a version of i , claudius with laughton and merle oberon , but it was abandoned with only a few scenes shot . korda made dark journey ( 1937 ) with conrad veidt and leigh , and had a big hit with elephant boy ( 1937 ) directed by his brother from a rudyard kipling story ; it made a star of sabu . korda also made some cheaper films : farewell again ( 1938 ) , storm in a teacup ( 1938 ) with leigh and rex harrison , the squeaker ( 1937 ) , action for slander ( 1937 ) , return of the scarlet pimpernel ( 1937 ) and paradise for two ( 1937 ) . knight without armour ( 1937 ) with donat and marlene dietrich was an expensive epic that failed to recoup its money . the divorce of lady x ( 1938 ) was a comedy with olivier and merle oberon . korda had a big success with the drum ( 1938 ) , directed by zoltan and starring sabu . he produced south riding ( 1938 ) , the challenge ( 1938 ) , the rebel son ( 1939 ) and prison without bars ( 1938 ) . during the second world war korda made more propaganda films , including q planes ( 1939 ) , with olivier , and the lion has wings ( 1939 ) . korda had a massive hit with another adventure film directed by zoltan , the four feathers ( 1939 ) . by 1939 michael powell had been hired as a contract director by korda on the strength of the edge of the world ( 1937 ) . korda set him to work on some projects such as burmese silver that were subsequently cancelled . powell , michael . a life in movies : an autobiography . london : heinemann , 1986 . nonetheless , powell was brought in to save a film that was being made as a vehicle for two of korda 's star players , conrad veidt and valerie hobson . the film was the spy in black ( 1939 ) , where powell first met emeric pressburger . korda also produced the comedy over the moon ( 1939 ) and the drama 21 days ( 1939 ) . korda soon ran into financial difficulties , and management of the denham complex was merged with pinewood in 1939 , '' denham studios '' , bfi screenonline . becoming part of the rank organisation . sojourn in hollywood . the outbreak of the second world war in europe meant that the thief of bagdad had to be completed in hollywood , where korda was based again for a few years . while he was in the united states he produced and directed that hamilton woman ( 1941 ) with laurence olivier and vivien leigh , and produced lydia ( 1941 ) with oberon . he also supervised jungle book ( 1942 ) , a live-action version of kipling 's stories , directed by zoltán korda . he also had minor involvement in to be or not to be ( 1942 ) . return to britain . korda was appointed a knight bachelor , for his contribution to the war effort , in the 1942 birthday honours . on 22 september 1942 he was knighted at an investiture ceremony at buckingham palace by george vi . he was the first film director to receive the honour . he returned to britain in 1943 as production chief of mgm-london films , with a £35 million ten-year programme . the scheme ended after one year , one film and a £1 million loss to mgm . the only film to come out of the deal was perfect strangers ( 1945 ) , directed by korda , and starring robert donat and deborah kerr . british lion films . via london films korda bought a controlling interest in british lion films . he produced a man about the house ( 1947 ) . in 1948 london films received an advance payment of £375,000 , the largest single payment received by a british film company , for three films , an ideal husband ( 1947 ) ( which korda directed ) , anna karenina ( 1948 ) and mine own executioner ( 1948 ) . the company released three other films , bonnie prince charlie ( 1948 ) , the winslow boy ( 1948 ) and the fallen idol ( 1948 ) . the winslow boy and fallen idol were hits . an ideal husband and anna karenina had some acclaim , but lost money at the box office . bonnie prince charlie was a fiasco . korda was also badly hurt by the trade war between the british and american film industries in the late 1940s . korda did recover , in part due to a £3 million loan british lion received from the national film finance corporation . in 1948 korda signed a co-production deal with david o . selznick . this resulted in the third man ( 1949 ) which was a success both critically and financially . london films made several films with smaller budgets : the cure for love ( 1949 ) , the happiest days of your life ( 1950 ) , the angel with the trumpet ( 1950 ) , my daughter joy ( 1950 ) , state secret ( 1950 ) , the wooden horse ( 1950 ) , seven days to noon ( 1951 ) , lady godiva rides again ( 1951 ) , the wonder kid ( 1951 ) , and mr . denning drives north ( 1951 ) . korda also helped to finance outcast of the islands ( 1952 ) , home at seven ( 1952 ) , who goes there !
