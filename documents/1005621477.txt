'' the novel offended members of chicago 's large polish-american community , some of whose members denounced it as pro-axis propaganda . not knowing that algren was of partly jewish descent , some incensed polish-american chicagoans said he was pro-nazi nordic . his polish-american critics persuaded mayor edward joseph kelly to ban the novel from the chicago public library . his first short-story collection , the neon wilderness ( 1947 ) , collected 24 stories from 1933 to 1947 . the same year , algren received an award from the american academy of arts and letters and a grant from chicago 's newberry library . google books , the neon wilderness : '' algren received a 1947 award from the american academy of arts and letters and a grant from chicago 's newberry library .

'' i have a message for the planet earth . we are beginning to enter the period of aquarius . many corrections have to be made by earth people . all your weapons of evil must be destroyed . you have only a short time to learn to live together in peace . you must live in peace '' & nbsp ; – here he paused to gain everybody 's attention & nbsp ; – '' you must live in peace or leave the galaxy !
