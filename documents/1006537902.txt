Night fighter

history . early examples . at the start of the first world war , most combatants had little capability of flying at night , and little need to do so . the only targets that could be attacked with any possibility of being hit in limited visibility would be cities , an unthinkable target at the time . the general assumption of a quick war meant no need existed for strategic attacks . cooper , ralph , jean-claude cailliez and gian picco .

( santa barbara : abc-clio , 2005 ) , pp . 45–46 . although defences had been set up , all of them proved woefully inadequate . as early as 1915 , a number of b.e.2c aircraft ( the infamous '' fokker fodder '' ) were modified into the first night fighters . after lack of success while using darts and small incendiary bombs to attack zeppelins from above , ultimately a lewis gun loaded with novel incendiary ammunition , was mounted at an angle of 45° to fire upwards , to attack the enemy from below . this technique proved to be very effective . gunston 1976 , p . 27 . after over a year of night zeppelin raids , on the night of 2–3 september 1916 , a be2c flown by captain leefe robinson downed the sl 11 , the first german airship to be shot down over britain . knell 2003 , pp . 109–111 . this action won the pilot a victoria cross and cash prizes totaling £3,500 put up by a number of individuals . this downing was not an isolated victory ; five more german airships were similarly destroyed between october and december 1916 , and caused the airship campaign to gradually be diminished over the next year with fewer raids mounted . unikoski , ari .

'' nightfighter navigator . retrieved : 1 august 2011 . by early 1941 , the first examples of a production-quality radar , ai mk . iv , were beginning to arrive . this coincided with the arrival of the beaufighter , which offered significantly higher performance than the pre-war blenheims ; it was the highest performance aircraft capable of carrying the bulky early airborne interception radars used for night fighter operations , and quickly became invaluable as a night fighter . moyes 1966 , p . 5 . hastings 1979 , p . 240 . over the next few months , more and more beaufighters arrived and the success of the night fighters roughly doubled every month until may , when the luftwaffe ended their bombing efforts . although night bombing never ended , its intensity was greatly decreased , giving the raf time to introduce the ai mk . viii radar working in the microwave band , and the de havilland mosquito to mount it . thirsk 2006 , pp . 124–127 . hastings 1979 , p . 240 . this combination remained the premier night fighter until the end of the war . as the german effort wound down , the raf 's own bombing campaign was growing . the mosquitos had little to do over the uk , so a number of squadrons were formed within no . 100 group raf and fit with special systems , such as perfectos and serrate , for homing-in on german night fighters . rawnsley and wright 1998 , p . 151 . the british also experimented with mounting pilot-operated ai mark 6 radar sets in single-seat fighters , and the hurricane ii c ( nf ) , a dozen of which were produced in 1942 , became the first radar-equipped , single-seat night fighter in the world . it served with 245 and 247 squadrons briefly and unsuccessfully before being sent to india to 176 squadron , with which it served until the end of 1943 . marchant 1996 thomas 1996 a similarly radar-equipped hawker typhoon was also developed , but no production followed . sortehaug 1998 , pp . 23 , 30 . german airborne interception radar efforts at this point were about two years behind the british . unlike in britain , where the major targets lay only a few minutes ' flight time from the coast , germany was defence of the reich that gave them long times to deal with intruding bombers . instead of airborne radar , they relied on ground-based systems ; the targets would first be picked up by radar assigned to a '' cell '' , the radar would then direct a searchlight to '' paint '' the target , allowing the fighters to attack them without on-board aids . the searchlights were later supplanted with short-range radars that tracked both the fighters and bombers , allowing ground operators to direct the fighters to their targets . by july 1940 , this system was well developed as the kammhuber line , and proved able to deal with the small raids by isolated bombers the raf was carrying out at the time . robinson 1988 , p . 68 . at the urging of r.v . jones , the raf changed their raid tactics to gather all of their bombers into a single '' stream '' . this meant that the ground-based portion of the system was overwhelmed ; with only one or two searchlights or radars available per '' cell '' , the system was able to handle perhaps six interceptions per hour . by flying all of the bombers over a cell in a short period , the vast majority of the bombers flew right over them without ever having been plotted , let alone attacked . german success against the raf plummeted , reaching a nadir on 30/31 may 1942 , when the first 1,000-bomber raid attacked cologne , losing only four aircraft to german night fighters . jones 1978 , pp . preface , p . 500 . in 1942 , the germans first started deploying the initial b/c low uhf-band version of the lichtenstein radar , and in extremely limited numbers , using a 32-dipole element matratze ( mattress ) antenna array . this late date , and slow introduction , combined with the capture of a ju 88r-1 night fighter equipped with it in april 1943 when flown to raf dyce , scotland , by a defecting luftwaffe crew , allowed british radio engineers to develop jamming equipment to counter it . a race developed with the germans attempting to introduce new sets and the british attempting to jam them . the early lichtenstein b/c was replaced by the similar uhf-band lichtenstein c-1 , but when the german night fighter defected and landed in scotland in april 1943 , that radar was quickly jammed . the low vhf-band sn-2 unit that replaced the c-1 remained relatively secure until july 1944 , but only at the cost of using huge , eight-dipole element hirschgeweih ( stag 's antlers ) antennae that slowed their fighters as much as 25 & nbsp ; mph , making them easy prey for british night fighters that had turned to the offensive role . the capture in july 1944 of a ju 88g-1 night fighter of njg 2 equipped with an sn-2 lichtenstein set , flown by mistake into raf woodbridge , revealed the secrets of the later , longer-wavelength replacement for the earlier b/c and c-1 sets . price 2006 , p . 67 . the luftwaffe also used single-engined aircraft in the night-fighter role , starting in 1939 with the arado ar 68 and early messerschmitt bf 109 models , which they later referred to as wilde sau ( wild boar ) . in this case , the fighters , typically focke-wulf fw 190s , were equipped only with a direction finder and landing lights to allow them to return to base at night . for the fighter to find their targets , other aircraft , which were guided from the ground , would drop strings of flares in front of the bombers . in other cases , the burning cities below provided enough light to see their targets . scutts and weal 1998 , pp . 46–47 . messerschmitt bf 109 had g6n and similar models fitted with fug 350 naxos '' z '' radar receivers for homing in on the 3-gigahertz band h2s emissions of raf bombers – the april 1944 combat debut of the american-designed h2x bomb-aiming radar , operating at a higher 10 & nbsp ; ghz frequency for both raf pathfinder mosquitos and usaaf b-24 liberators that premiered their use over europe , deployed a bombing radar that could not be detected by the german naxos equipment . the bf 109g series aircraft fitted with the naxos radar detectors also were fitted with the low- to mid-vhf band fug 217/218 neptun active search radars , as were focke-wulf fw 190 a-6/r11 aircraft : these served as radar-equipped night-fighters with njgr 10 and njg 11 . a sole fw 190 a-6 wk.nr.550214 fitted with fug 217 is a rare survivor . ledwoch and skupiewski 1994 the effective schräge musik offensive armament fitment was the german name given to installations of upward-firing autocannon mounted in heavy fighter by the luftwaffe and both the imperial japanese navy air service and imperial japanese army air service during world war ii , with the first victories for the luftwaffe and ijnas each occurring in may 1943 . this innovation allowed the night fighters to approach and attack bombers from below , where they were outside the bomber crew 's field of view . few bombers of that era carried defensive guns in the ventral position . an attack by a schräge musik-equipped fighter was typically a complete surprise to the bomber crew , who would only realise that a fighter was close by when they came under fire . particularly in the initial stage of operational use until early 1944 , the sudden fire from below was often attributed to ground fire rather than a fighter . wilson 2008 , p . 3 . rather than nighttime raids , the us army air forces were dedicated to daytime bombing over germany and axis allies , that statistically were much more effective . currie 1999 , p . 11 . the british night-bombing raids showed a success rate of only one out of 100 targets successfully hit . heaton and lewis 2008 at the urging of the british , who were looking to purchase us-made aircraft , us day fighters were initially adapted to a night role , including the douglas p-70 and later lockheed p-38 lightning . the only purpose-built night fighter design deployed during the war , the american northrop p-61 black widow was introduced first in europe and then saw action in the pacific , but it was given such a low priority that the british had ample supplies of their own designs by the time it was ready for production . the first usaaf unit using the p-61 did not move to britain until february 1944 ; operational use did not start until the summer , and was limited throughout the war . colonel winston kratz , director of night-fighter training in the usaaf , considered the p-61 as adequate in its role , '' it was a good night fighter . it did not have enough speed '' . pape 1992 , p . 208 . the u.s . navy was forced into the night-fighting role when japanese aircraft successfully harassed their units on night raids . the japanese navy had long screened new recruits for exceptional night vision , using the best on their ships and aircraft instead of developing new equipment for this role . to counter these raids , the navy fitted microwave-band , compact radar sets to the wings of its single-engined grumman f6f hellcat and vought f4u corsair fighters by the close of the war , operating them successfully in the pacific . in several cases these aircraft were used on raids of their own . gunston 1976 , pp . 112 , 183–184 . . postwar . even while the war raged , the jet engine so seriously upset aircraft design that the need for dedicated jet-powered night fighters became clear . both the british and germans spent some effort on the topic , but as the germans were on the defensive , their work was given a much higher priority . the messerschmitt me 262 , the first operational jet fighter in the world , was adapted to the role , such as the installation of on-board neptun radar high-vhf band radar and hirschgeweih ( '' stag 's antlers '' ) antennae ; intercepts were generally or entirely made using wilde sau methods , rather than ai radar-controlled interception . several me 262 pilots were able to attain a high number of kills in the type such as oberleutnant kurt welter , who claimed a total of 25 mosquitos downed during nighttime missions . other forces did not have the pressing need to move to the jet engine ; britain and the us were facing enemies with aircraft of even lower performance than their existing night fighters . however , the need for new designs was evident , and some low-level work started in the closing stages of the war , including the us contract for the northrop f-89 scorpion . blazer and dorio 1993 , pp . 1–3 . when the soviet plans to build an atomic bomb became known in the west in 1948 , this project was still long from being ready to produce even a prototype , and in march 1949 , they started development of both the north american f-86d sabre and lockheed f-94 starfire as stop-gap measures . coniglio , serigio . '' f-94 starfire ( monopama special file ) . '' aviation and marine international , issue 34 , june 1976 . all of these fighters entered service during the early 1950s . in the korean war , after the starfire proved to be ineffective against the latest soviet-supplied aircraft , marine corps douglas f3d skyknights shot down six aircraft , including five mikoyan-gurevich mig-15s without loss , as the mig-15s lacked radar to shoot down individual fighters , though they were effective against bomber formations at night . gordon , yefim . mikoyan-gurevich mig-15 . leicester , uk : midland publishing , 2001 . during the immediate postwar era , the raf launched studies into new fighter designs , but gave these projects relatively low priority . buttler 2004 , p . 193 . by the time of the soviet bomb test , the night-fighter design was still strictly a paper project , and the existing mosquito fleet was generally unable to successfully intercept the tupolev tu-4 bomber it was expected to face . this led to rushed programs to introduce new , interim night-fighter designs ; these efforts led to several night-fighter versions of ubiquitous gloster meteor to replace the mosquitos during the early 1950s . williams aeroplane monthly april 1995 , p . 6–7 . a similar conversion of the de havilland vampire was also introduced ; this was originally developed by the company as a private venture and initially ordered by egypt , instead the raf took over the order to serve an interim measure between the retirement of the mosquito night fighter and the meteor night fighter 's introduction . these types were also widely exported ; meteor night fighters were acquired by france , syria , egypt and israel amongst others . williams aeroplane monthly june 1995 , p . 12 . both the meteor and vampire conversions were rapidly followed by a more capable night fighter in the form of the de havilland venom , the first model of which having been introduced during 1953 . birtles 1999 , p . 72 . more advanced night fighter models of the venom would follow , birtles 1999 , pp . 75–76 . as well as of the navalised de havilland sea venom , which served with the royal navy along with other operators . gunston 1981 , p . 56 . an advanced night-fighter design was eventually introduced to raf service in 1956 in the form of the gloster javelin , a delta wing aircraft capable of performing rapid ascents and attaining an altitude of 45,000 feet . allward 1983 , p . 6 . however , due to rapid advances in aircraft capabilities , the javelin quickly became considered to be outdated and the type was retired during 1968 . wixley aircraft illustrated september 1984 , p . 422 . in canada , avro canada developed its own night fighter , the cf-100 canuck , which entered service with the royal canadian air force ( rcaf ) during 1952 . dow 1997 , p . 72 . into the 1960s , night fighters still existed as a separate class of aircraft . however , as they continued to grow in capability , radar-equipped interceptors could take on the role of night fighters , thus the class went into decline . examples of these latter-day interceptor/night-fighters include the avro arrow , campagna 1998 , pp . & nbsp ;

at the time , the vought f-8 crusader had already been accepted as a '' day '' dogfighter , while the subsonic mcdonnell f3h demon was the navy 's all-weather fighter . the phantom was developed as the navy 's first supersonic , all-weather , radar-equipped fighter armed with radar-guided missiles . swanborough and bowers 1976 , p . 301 . . however , compared to early air-superiority designs such as the f-100 or f-8 , the massive phantom , nevertheless , had enough raw power from its twin j79 engines to prove adaptable as the preferred platform for tangling with agile mig-17 and mig-21 fighters over the skies of vietnam , dorr and bishop 1996 , pp . 48–49 . knaack 1974 , p . 274 . as well as replacing the us air force convair f-102 delta dagger and convair f-106 delta dart for continental interception duties and the republic f-105 thunderchief as a medium fighter-bomber . the need for close-in dogfighting spelled the end for the specialised grumman f-111b , which was armed only with long-range aim-54 phoenix missiles for fleet defense against bombers . gunston 1978 , pp . 8 , 10–15 . the navy instead developed the grumman f-14 tomcat , which on top of the heavy phoenix , retained the phantom 's versatility and improved agility for dogfighting . spick 2000 , pp . 72–74 , 112 . gunston and spick 1983 , p . 112 . the mcdonnell douglas f-15 eagle was also an interceptor with enhanced agility , but did not carry the phoenix in preference to the role of an air-superiority fighter . the reduced size and costs of avionics have allowed even smaller modern fighters to have night-interception capability . in the us air force 's lightweight fighter program , the f-16 was originally envisaged as inexpensive day fighter , but quickly converted to an all-weather role . the similar mcdonnell douglas f/a-18 hornet in its cf-18 variant for the rcaf , was ordered with a 0.6 mcd night-identification light to enhance its night-interception capabilities . first world war . royal aircraft factory b.e.2 night fighter sopwith camel '' comic '' night fighter sopwith 1½ strutter supermarine nighthawk . second world war . germany . arado ar 68 dornier do 217 focke-wulf ta 154 heinkel he 219 junkers ju 88 messerschmitt bf 110 messerschmitt me 262 a-1a/u2 , b-1a/u1 focke-wulf fw 189 a-1 focke-wulf fw 190 a-5/r11 . italy . fiat cr.42cn cant z.1018/cn '' leone '' caproni-vizzola f-5/cn reggiane re.2001cn serie i , ii , iii '' falco '' . japan . aichi s1a denko kawasaki ki-45 mitsubishi ki-46 mitsubishi ki-67 nakajima c6n nakajima j1n yokosuka d4y yokosuka p1y . hungary/romania . fiat cr.42 '' falco '' mávag héja messerschmitt bf 109f messerschmitt bf 110g-4d messerschmitt me 210ca-1/n . soviet union . petlyakov pe-3bis yakovlev yak-9 . united kingdom . douglas havoc ( us-built ) turbinlite ( us-built ) boulton paul defiant bristol beaufighter bristol blenheim de havilland mosquito fairey firefly . united states . douglas p-70 bristol beaufighter ( british supplied ) grumman f6f hellcat lockheed p-38m '' night lightning '' northrop p-61 black widow vought f4u corsair . france . mureaux 114/cn2 morane-saulnier m.s . 408/cn potez 631 c3/n . post-war . canada . avro canada cf-100 . united kingdom . de havilland mosquito de havilland hornet de havilland vampire de havilland venom gloster meteor gloster javelin . united states . douglas f3d skyknight grumman f7f tigercat lockheed f-94 starfire mcdonnell f2h banshee mcdonnell f-101 voodoo north american f-86d sabre northrop f-89 scorpion vought f4u corsair
