cold war ) ( nato reporting name ss-x-10 scrag ) gorodomlya g-1 - developed by a german team at gorodomlya island ( 57°12 ' 0.06 '' n , 33° 4 ' 0.02 '' e ) in 1948 , based on the v-2 with detachable warhead and integral propellant tanks . ( a.k.a . r-10 ) . gorodomlya g-1m - the g-1 with a more powerful engine proposed in 1949 . gorodomlya g-2 - ( a.k.a . r-12 ) developed as far as preliminary design the g-2 first stage was to have been powered by a cluster of three engines from the g-1 with a thrust of approx 100tons , the second stage being capable of delivering the warhead 2,000 to 2,500 kilometres . insurmountable problems with control of the second stage forced abandonment . gorodomlya g-3 - the g-3 project was to have been a two-stage , g-1 derived rocket , with a winged upper stage similar to the a9 developed by wernher von braun 's team at peenemünde , for a projected range of 8,000 to 10,000 kilometres gorodomlya g-4 - in april 1949 the gorodomlya group were given the same requirements as the team at nii-88 ( which produced the r-3 ) . the german group designed a 24m ( 78 & nbsp ; ft 9in ) tall cone shaped rocket with an empty weight ( including a three-ton warhead ) of seven tons and a launch weight of 70.85 tons , ( a.k.a . r-14 ) . gorodomlya g-5 - designed in parallel with the g-4 , ( a.k.a . r-15 ) , another group at gorodomlya proposed a ramjet powered unmanned bomber boosted by a g-1 or a4 rocket , cruising at altitude for a range of 3,000 kilometres . green cheese ( missile ) green flash ( missile ) agm-176 griffin grom . h . hadès harpoon hatf-i hatf-ia hatf-ib hatf-va hatf-viii
