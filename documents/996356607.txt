Swedish riksdaler

history . penning accounting system . the daler was introduced in 1534 . it was initially intended for international use and was divided into 4 marks and then a mark is further subdivided into 8 öres and then a öre is further subdivided into 24 pennings . in 1604 , the name was changed to riksdaler ( '' daler of the rike '' , c.f . reichsthaler ) . in 1609 , the riksdaler rose to a value of 6 mark when the other swedish coins were debased but the riksdaler remained constant . from 1624 , daler were issued in copper as well as silver . because of the low value of copper , large plate money ( plåtmynt ) was issued . swedish coin museum from myntkabinettet.se these were rectangular pieces of copper weighing , in some cases , several kilograms . ( the largest one is worth 10 daler and weighs almost . they circulated until 1776 . as silver became scarce , the silver daler rose in value relative to the copper daler , with the exchange rate between the two eventually being set at a ratio of 3 to 1 . denominations in copper money were marked k.m . or kmt , with s.m . or smt denoting silver money . the cumbersome size and weight of plate money eventually prompted sweden to become the first country in europe to issue banknotes . these were issued by stockholms banco in 1661 . the notes lost much of their value due to over production but succeeded in alleviating the immediate problem . they were issued until 1667 . in 1681 , the silver daler was debased , such that 1 riksdaler 2 silver daler , with a further debasement in 1712 resulting in 1 riksdaler 3 silver daler . riksdaler accounting system . in 1776 , a new currency system was announced , which came into use at the beginning of 1777 . the new currency was based on the riksdaler subdivided into 48 skilling ( worth two old öre , sometimes spelled schilling with the plural schillingar ) , with each skilling further subdivided into 12 rundstycken . pre-existing copper coins were halved in value and only the most recent silver coins retained their face values . the new currency was issued in banknotes ( fiat money ) and silver and copper coins . at first , only the riksens ständers wexel-banco ( the bank of the riksdag of the estates ) could issue banknotes but , in 1789 , the riksgälds kontor ( swedish national debt office ) was established and given the right to issue its own banknotes . the riksdaler specie was minted in silver , the riksdaler banco was issued by the bank and the riksdaler riksgälds was issued by the debt office . both the bank and debt office issued copper coins . the riksdaler specie was protected against inflation through its connection to silver but the banknotes suffered heavily from a seigniorage induced inflation . in 1803 , the values of the two paper moneys were tied , with 1 riksdaler banco riksdaler riksgälds . in 1830 , the exchange rate to the silver coinage was also fixed , with 1 riksdaler specie riksdaler banco 4 riksdaler riksgälds . the value of the copper coins of the riksens ständers wexel-banco fell ( relative to silver ) in line with the bank 's paper money . thus , from 1830 , there were 128 bank skilling to the riksdaler specie and these became the new standard subdivision of the riksdaler specie in 1834 , carrying the name skilling banco . decimal system . in 1855 two reforms took place , the introduction of the riksdaler riksmynt and the change to a decimal system . one riksdaler specie was equal to 4 riksdaler riksmynt , each of which was divided into 100 öre . the scandinavian monetary union replaced the riksdaler riksmynt in 1873 with a new currency , the krona . an equal valued krone/krona of the monetary union replaced the three scandinavian currencies at the rate of 1 krone/krona danish rigsdaler norwegian speciedaler 1 swedish riksdaler riksmynt . the now obsolete 25 öre coin was also often referred to as tolvskilling ( 12 skilling ) during most of the 20th century . although it is correct that 25 öre krona ( after 1873 ) riksdaler riksmynt ( 1855–1873 ) riksdaler riksgälds ( to 1855 ) 12 skilling riksgälds , no such coins ever existed . however , since 1 riksdaler riksgälds riksdaler specie ( silver ) , 12 skilling riksgälds riksdaler specie 3 skilling specie ( silver ) . coins in the denomination riksdaler specie were actually issued up to 1855 . it is not clear if the name tolvskilling was used as a common name for this coin or if it simply was used to help people to get accustomed to the new decimal system . coins . in the 1770s , before the introduction of the new currency , coins were being issued in denominations of 1 öre k.m . , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 öre s.m . , 1 and 2 daler s.m . and 1 riksdaler . after the reform of 1777 , silver
