Edward Carson

cabinet member . on 25 may 1915 , asquith appointed carson attorney-general when the coalition government was formed after the liberal government was brought down by the shell crisis and the resignation of admiral fisher . he resigned on 19 october , however , citing his opposition to government policy on war in the balkans . during asquith 's coalition government of 1915–1916 , there was no formal opposition in either the commons or the lords . the only party not in asquith 's liberal , conservative , labour coalition was the irish nationalist party led by john redmond . however , this party supported the government and did not function as an opposition . after carson , the leading figure among the irish unionist allies of the conservative party , resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 october 1915 , he then became the de facto leader of those unionists who were not members of the government , effectively leader of the opposition in the commons . he played a major role in forcing the resignation of asquith as prime minister , returning to office on 10 december 1916 as first lord of the admiralty , and elevated to the powerful british war cabinet as a minister without portfolio on 17 july 1917 . war memoirs of david lloyd george , vol . iii , london : ivor nicholson & watson , 1934 , pp . 1175–77 carson was hostile to the foundation of the league of nations as he believed that this institution would be ineffectual against war . in a speech on 7 december 1917 he said : talk to me of treaties ! talk to me of the league of nations ! every great power in europe was pledged by treaty to preserve belgium . that was a league of nations , but it failed . henry r . winkler , '' the development of the league of nations idea in great britain , 1914–1919 '' , the journal of modern history , vol . 20 , no . 2 . ( june 1948 ) , p . 105 . early in 1918 , the government decided to extend conscription to ireland , and that ireland would have to be given home rule in order to make it acceptable . carson disagreed in principle and again resigned on 21 january . he gave up his seat at the university of dublin in the 1918 general election and was instead elected for belfast duncairn . he continued to lead the unionists , but when the government of ireland act 1920 was introduced , advised his party to work for the exemption of six ulster counties from home rule as the best compromise ( a compromise he had previously rejected ) . this proposal passed and as a result the parliament of northern ireland was established . frank costello , '' king george v 's speech at stormont ( 1921 ) : prelude to the anglo-irish truce '' , eire-ireland , ( 1987 ) , pp . 43–57 . in january 1921 he met in london over three days with father o'flanagan and lord justice sir james o'connor to try to find a mutual agreement that would end the anglo-irish war , but without result . '' memorandum by james o'connor of an interview with edward carson '' ; ria , dublin , 1993 . national archives of ireland file ucda p150/1902 after the partition of ireland , carson repeatedly warned ulster unionist leaders not to alienate northern catholics , as he foresaw this would make northern ireland unstable . in 1921 he stated : '' we used to say that we could not trust an irish parliament in dublin to do justice to the protestant minority . let us take care that that reproach can no longer be made against your parliament , and from the outset let them see that the catholic minority have nothing to fear from a protestant majority . '' in old age , while at london 's carlton club , he confided to the anglo-irish ( and catholic ) historian sir charles petrie his disillusionment with belfast politics : '' i fought to keep ulster part of the united kingdom , but stormont is turning her into a second-class dominion . '' sir charles petrie , a historian looks at his world ( london : sedgwick & jackson , 1972 ) , p . 27 . he did n't see himself as an ulsterman and , unlike many northern unionists it is thought he had an emotional connection with ireland as a single entity . . judge . carson was asked to lead the unionists during the election to become the first prime minister of northern ireland . he declined due to his lack of connections with any northern ireland constituency ( an opponent once taunted him saying : '' he has no country , he has no caste '' ) , marjoribanks , volume one : the life of lord carson , london , 1932 , p . 8 and resigned the leadership of the party in february 1921 . carson was appointed one of seven lord of appeal in ordinary on 24 may 1921 and was created a life peer under the appellate jurisdiction act 1876 on 1 june 1921 as baron carson , of duncairn in the county antrim . . private life . carson married twice . his first wife was annette kirwan from county galway , daughter of henry persse kirwan , a retired county inspector of the royal irish constabulary . they were married on 19 december 1879 . he had two sons and two daughters by his first wife ( he described them as a '' rum lot '' ) , namely : the hon . william henry lambert carson , born 2 october 1880 ( d . 1930 ) the hon . aileen seymour carson , born 13 november 1881 the hon . gladys isobel carson , born 1885 the hon . walter seymour carson , born 1890 the first lady carson died in 1913 . his second wife was ruby frewen ( 1881–1966 ) , a yorkshirewoman , the daughter of lt.-col . stephen frewen , later frewen-laton mp ( 1857–1933 ) and emily augusta ( peacocke ) frewen . they were married on 17 september 1914 ; she was 29 and he was 60 . they had one son : the hon . edward carson mp , born 17 february 1920 . later years . carson retired in october 1929 . in july 1932 , he had witnessed the unveiling of a large statue ( sculpted by l . s . merrifield ) of himself in front of parliament buildings at stormont . the statue was unveiled by lord craigavon in the presence of more than 40,000 people . the statue was cast in bronze and placed upon a plinth . the inscription on the base read '' by the ulster loyalism as an expression of their love and admiration for its subject '' . this was the last time he visited ulster . . state funeral . lord carson lived at cleve court , a queen anne house near minster in the isle of thanet , kent , bought in 1921 . it was here that carson died peacefully on 22 october 1935 . britain gave him a state funeral , which took place in belfast at st anne 's cathedral ; he is still the only person to have been buried there . from a silver bowl , soil from each of the six counties of northern ireland was scattered on to his coffin , which had earlier been covered by the union flag , which however was removed during the service . at his funeral service the choir sang his own favourite hymn , '' i vow to thee , my country '' . a warship had brought his body to belfast and the funeral took place on saturday 26 october 1935 . thousands of shipworkers stopped work and bowed their heads as hms broke steamed slowly up belfast lough , with carson 's flag-draped coffin sat on the quarterdeck . . memories . even before his death , there was an organized effort to portray carson as the heroic embodiment of the militant unionist spirit . in november 1932 the new stormont parliament became the greatest carson monument , giving his admirers the symbolic endorsement of their state . his statue was unveiled as the speakers excited the audience with triumphalist images of protestant deliverance from catholic tyranny . carson 's funeral in 1935 was attended with pomp and unionist symbolism , as happened again with the dedication of a plaque in his memory in 1938 . calling for unity with britain , numerous ceremonial rituals , memorials , and anniversaries affirmed the legitimacy of the state , and the protestant ascendancy . the media enthusiastically participated , paying much less attention to such mundane issues as massive unemployment , poor housing , and rising religious tensions . gillian mcintosh , '' symbolic mirrors : commemorations of edward carson in the 1930s .
