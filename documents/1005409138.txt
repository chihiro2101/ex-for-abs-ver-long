United States Army Forces in the Far East

history . in january 1941 , the intelligence officer ( g-2 ) of the philippine department had recommended , to his superior in washington d.c . , that an american high command in the far east be created , with the commander of the philippine department as the designated commander of said command . it does not appear this idea was seriously considered until douglas macarthur suggested , to the army chief of staff , that such a command be created with macarthur as the far eastern commander . on 6 june , acting chief of the war plans division brigadier general leonard t . gerow noted that he saw no need for such a command , as us forces in the far east were concentrated in the philippines . as such , gerow argued that should a '' crisis '' occur , then macarthur should become the commander of , not some new command , but rather , of the philippine department itself . on 20 june , george c . marshall informed macarthur , '' both the secretary of war ( stimson ) and i are much concerned about the situation in the far east . your qualifications and experience make you the logical selection for the army commander in the far east should the situation approach a crisis . the secretary has delayed recommending your appointment as he does not feel the time has arrived for such action . at the proper time , he will recommend to the president that you be so appointed . '' on 17 july , gerow made the following recommendations : the president should call into the service of the united states all organized military forces of the commonwealth of the philippines ; general macarthur should be called to active duty as a general and assigned as commander of army forces in the far east ; 10,000,000 , from the president 's emergency fund should be allotted to cover the costs of mobilization and training of the philippine army ; training of the philippine army be financed from the sugar excise fund , or from other funds ; and 425 u.s . army reserve officers be sent to the philippines to assist in mobilization and training . on 25 july , secretary of war henry l . stimson requested that president roosevelt issue orders calling the military forces of the commonwealth into active service for the united states . stimson explains , '' all practical steps should be taken to increase the defensive strength of the philippine islands '' . the following day , roosevelt froze all japanese assets within the united states and issued the orders to absorb the forces of the philippine army . that same day , the war department created the usaffe command , with jurisdiction over the philippine department and the military forces of commonwealth of the philippines ( seemingly principally the philippine army , with two regular and ten reserve divisions ) . at the same time , macarthur was recalled to active duty , with the rank of lieutenant general , as the usaffe commander , from his positions as military advisor to the philippine government and field marshal of the philippine army . following the japanese invasion of the philippines in december 1941 , the short-lived american-british-dutch-australian command ( abdacom ) was formed on 1 january 1942 , to control all allied forces in south east asia and the south west pacific . abdacom nominally controlled usaffe forces , although the latter was effectively an independent force . in march , due to the worsening allied position in asia and the pacific , roosevelt ordered macarthur to relocate his command to australia . macarthur 's famous speech regarding the philippines , in which he said , '' i came out of bataan and i shall return '' was made at terowie , south australia on 20 march . general jonathan wainwright officially assumed control of the remaining forces in the philippines , now known as united states forces in the philippines ( usfip ) on 23 march . on 18 april 1942 , abdacom was replaced by south west pacific area ( command ) ( swpa ) in melbourne , including usfip . macarthur was appointed supreme commander , swpa . usfip , with the exception of some ad hoc guerilla and resistance outfits , had surrendered to japanese by 8 may . macarthur formally reconstituted usaffe in australia in february 1943 , to assume responsibility for all administrative staff duties pertaining to u.s . army units in the swpa , as well as control of guerrilla forces in the philippines . on 20 october 1944 , the recapture of the philippines commenced when allied forces battle of leyte . the campaign was declared completed on 4 july 1945 . usaffe was formally dissolved in the lead-up to philippine independence on 4 july 1946 . order of battle . 31 july 1941 . total strength—22,532 ( 1,434 officers—21,098 enlisted , including 11,937 philippine scouts ) usaffe headquarters ( 5 ) philippine department headquarters ( 289 ) philippine division ( 10,473 ) harbor defenses of manila and subic bays ( 5,360 ) philippine army air corps ( 2,407 ) 26th cavalry regiment ( 838 ) 43rd infantry regiment ( 329 ) 86th field artillery battalion ( ps ) ( 388 ) 88th field artillery regiment ( ps ) ( 518 ) 808th military police company ( 69 ) service detachments ( 1,836 ) other ( 20 ) . 30 november 1941 . total strength : 31,095 ( 2,504 officers and 28,591 enlisted , including 11,957 philippine scouts ) usaffe headquarters ( 61 ) philippine department ( 553 ) north luzon force ( 38 ) south luzon force ( 10 ) visayan-mindanao force ( 9 ) philippine division ( 10,233 ) harbor defenses of manila and subic bays ( 5,225 ) far east air force ( 5,609 ) 26th cavalry regiment ( ps ) ( 842 ) 43d infantry regiment ( ps ) ( 328 ) 86th field artillery battalion ( ps ) ( 395 ) 88th field artillery regiment ( ps ) ( 538 ) 200th coast artillery ( aa ) regiment ( 1,809 ) 192nd tank battalion ( 588 ) 194th tank battalion ( 410 ) 808th military police company ( 160 ) service detachments ( 4,268 ) other ( 19 ) . awards . usaffe received four distinguished unit citations ( later converted to presidential unit citations ) for the following time periods - 7 december 1941 to 10 may 1942 ( wd go 22-42 amended by da go 46-48 ) 8 to 31 december 1941 ( wd go 14-42 ) 12 january to 14 february 1942 ( wd go 32-42 ) 21 january 1942 ( wd go 14-42 ) da pam 672-1 , unit citation and campaign participation credit register , headquarters united states army , july 1961 , pg . 529 . usaffe also received the philippine presidential unit citation . see also . asiatic fleet military history of the philippines military history of the united states . references . . external links . national archives , timeline philippine archives collection . hyperwar , u.s . army forces , far east orbat.com , usaffe december 1941 united states army , final swpa operations and organization of afpac , extracted from macarthur reports , center for military history
