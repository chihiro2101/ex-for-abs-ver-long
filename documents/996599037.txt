Civilization (1980 board game)

overview . the civilization board depicts areas around the mediterranean sea . the board is divided into many regions . each player plays a historic civilization and starts in the area where appropriate for that civilization , and attempts to grow and expand their empire over successive turns , trying to build the greatest civilization while minimizing the effects of calamities and war . the goal of civilization is to be first to advance to the final space on a table called the archaeological succession table ( ast ) . the ast starts at 8,000 b.c . and ends at 250 b.c . the ast contains fifteen spaces , and players are advanced on the ast each turn . at several points , however , certain conditions must be met ( such as , the civilization must have a certain number of cities ) in order to advance . since any given civilization is unlikely to meet the advancement criteria at every stage of the ast , games usually last more than fifteen turns . civilization is unusual in that it does not focus on war and combat , as many games of its genre do . instead , players are encouraged to trade and cooperate in order to advance . however , war and combat are entirely permissible , and are sometimes inevitable . in fact , the game is designed to limit players ' geographical expansion possibilities , forcing them to deal with other civilizations militarily , diplomatically , or otherwise if they wish their own civilization to reach its full potential . gameplay . a game starts with each player having a single population token in the area based on the specific civilization represented ( e.g . on the island of crete for the cretans or in africa for the egyptians ) . as the first few turns progress , the population expands exponentially . since any given area only supports so many population tokens , players need to spread out , eventually meeting the civilizations of other players . as each civilization grows , adding more and more population to the board , players can convert excess population into cities by gathering six population tokens in an area favoring settlement ( or twelve in other areas ) . each city grants a trade card to the owner , one of eleven commodity , such as iron , salt and grain . having more cities gives access to more valuable commodities , such as bronze , spice and gold . collecting more cards in a set gives an exponentially larger payout . for example , one salt is worth 3 points , two are worth 12 points , and three are worth 27 points . thus , players are encouraged to trade with each other to collect sets of the same commodity . along with trade come eight disaster such as volcanoes , famine and civil war , which destroy population and cities . gains from trade are in turn used to purchase civilization cards , such as agriculture , coinage , philosophy and medicine , which grant special abilities and give bonuses toward future civilization card purchases . trade is the most important activity in civilization . trade cards give a player 's civilization wealth , which ultimately helps their civilization advance on the ast . many '' trade sessions '' can become quite vocal and exuberant as players try to out-trade one another . since players are only required to tell the truth about one of the cards and the total points value they are trading , calamity cards can be slipped into a trade , thereby avoiding receiving the effects of the calamity . the goal of the game is to advance ( on the ast ) through the late iron age and become the most advanced civilization on the map board . this is accomplished through clever game play and purchase of several high-value civilization cards . editions . civilization by hartland trefoil ( 1980 ) . civilization by avalon hill ( 1982 ) : 1st edition with a cover depicting an antique greek temple , an egyptian fresco and some baskets ;

'' after a length assessment of the game , he concluded , '' civilization is a game that defies comparison with others . it 's a fine value and is highly recommended . '' in the january 1990 edition of games international ( issue 12 ) , steve jones examined the game at length and concluded , '' civilization is an excellent multi-player game for those who like long games which require considerable thought , concentration and decision making . '' civilization was chosen for inclusion in the 2007 book hobby games : the 100 best . steven savile commented that designer francis tresham '' created a thinking gamer 's game , one that deserves to be played around a table with friends â€” especially the cheerfully scheming sort '' . . reviews . casus belli 44 ( april 1988 ) . awards . at the 1983 origins awards , civilization was awarded the charles s . roberts award for '' best pre-20th century boardgame of 1982 '' . . legacy . the game shares the name and the basic broad themes of expansion , development and conflict with the computer game civilization by sid meier . the computer game is otherwise unrelated to civilization . although the success of the civilization computer games series has led to multiple board games , starting with sid meier 's civilization : the boardgame in 2002 , none of these games has any direct relation to the civilization board game discussed here . references . external links . product page at gibsons games
