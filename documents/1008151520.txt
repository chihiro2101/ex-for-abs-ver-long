'' in article for the washington post in march 1992 , conservative columnist charles krauthammer suggested : '' the real problem with buchanan . is not that his instincts are antisemitic but that they are , in various and distinct ways , fascistic . '' '' there 's no doubt , '' said krauthammer in 1999 when contacted for a salon article , '' he makes subliminal appeals to prejudice . '' he added : '' the interesting thing is how he can say these things and still be considered a national figure .

'' ryan accused buchanan of being '' the spokesman for nazi war criminals in america '' . neal sher , osi head in 1990 said buchanan had never contacted them , even when he was a government official . '' he essentially took what was fed him by our opponents , sometimes holocaust-deniers , and just regurgitated it , '' sher told the washington post . in 2009 , menachem z . rosensaft in the times of israel and jeffrey goldberg in the atlantic , objected to buchanan in his syndicated column comparing demjanjuk to jesus christ and buchanan calling him an '' american dreyfuss '' . it was viewed by goldberg as an example of the libel that the jewish deicide killed christ . describing buchanan 's comparison as '' strikingly offensive '' and an attempt to '' revive the charge of blood libel '' against jews , peter wehner wrote in commentary magazine : '' rarely do you find such an obscene mix of blasphemy and bigotry , and all in less than 900 words '' . the former guard had been deported to germany , where he was convicted of being an accessory to the murder of 28,000 jews at the sobibor extermination camp . . bitburg visit by president reagan . buchanan supported president reagan 's plan to visit a german military cemetery at bitburg in 1985 , where among buried wehrmacht soldiers were the graves of 48 waffen ss members . at the insistence of german chancellor helmut kohl and over the vocal objections of jewish groups , the trip went ahead . in a 1992 interview , elie wiesel described attending a white house meeting of jewish leaders about the trip : '' the only one really defending the trip was pat buchanan , saying , 'we can not give the perception of the president being subjected to jewish pressure . ' '' buchanan accused wiesel of fabricating the story in an abc interview in 1992 : '' i did n't say it and elie wiesel was n't even in the meeting . that meeting was held three weeks before the bitburg summit was held . if i had said that , it would have been out of there within hours and on the news '' . quoted by crossfire , cnn , february 24 , 1992 , transcript 514 . . comments on the holocaust . in a 1990 column for the new york post , buchanan wrote that it was impossible for 850,000 jews to be killed by diesel exhaust fed into the gas chamber at treblinka in a return to his interest in the demjanjuk case . '' diesel engines do not emit enough carbon monoxide to kill anybody , '' he wrote . the washington post cited the belief of experts who said there is more than sufficient carbon monoxide present in the fumes to speedily asphyxiate victims causing their death . patrick j . buchanan .

'' buchanan on the mclaughlin group on june 15 1990 , asserted : '' capitol hill is israeli occupied territory '' . he also said in the august 1990 program : '' the israelis want this war desperately because they want the united states to destroy the iraqi war machine . they want us to finish them off . they do n't care about our relations with the arab world . '' a.m . rosenthal , in an article for the new york times explicitly accused buchanan of antisemitism on the grounds that he had used the word '' israelis '' as a cover for jews . abraham foxman , the director of the adl , compared buchanan 's comments to insinuations made during the world war ii '' that jews were the only ones who sought american entry in the war against nazi germany '' . holocaust survivor elie wiesel in september 1990 said buchanan '' leaves the memory of jewish victims in such disdain ; a man who always takes the side of those accused of being killers ; a man who is constantly criticizing israel ; a man who always has something nasty to say about the jewish people '' . . statements on race and immigration . central park jogger case . in a 1989 column , buchanan called for the lynching of a 16-year old black teenager and the horsewhipping of four other younger african-american and hispanic teenagers for having allegedly raped a white jogger in the central park jogger case . he also called for the civilization of '' barbarians '' by putting the '' fear of death '' in them . robert c . smith , professor of political science at san francisco state university , characterized the column as racist . the five teenagers were convicted but later exonerated , and their convictions overturned , when in 2002 the real perpetrator of the crime confessed and dna testing affirmed his guilt . . personal life . buchanan married white house staffer shelley ann scarney in 1971 . they had a tabby cat named gipper , who reportedly sat on buchanan 's lap during staff meetings . buchanan identifies as a traditionalist catholic who attends mass in the extraordinary form of the roman rite , and strongly defended summorum pontificum . . electoral history . publications . books . . . . . . . . buchanan , patrick j . , state of emergency ( book ) . new york : thomas dunne books , 2006 . full text available . . . . . . major speeches . 1992 republican national convention keynote , august 17 , 1992 the cultural war for the soul of america , september 14 , 1992 1996 campaign announcement , march 20 , 1995 1996 campaign speech , georgia primary stump speech february 29 , 1996 free trade , chicago council on global affairs speech november 18 , 1998 2000 campaign announcement , march 2 , 1999 a time for truth about china , commonwealth club speech april 5 , 1999 to reunite a nation , richard nixon library speech on immigration january 18 , 2000 2000 reform party nomination acceptance , august 12 , 2000 death of the west , commonwealth club speech january 14 , 2002 . selected articles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . interviews . . . . . . slen , peter . in depth with pat buchanan . c-span , may 2 , 2010 . . . see also . christian right constitution party ( united states ) culture war non-interventionism old right ( united states ) paleoconservatism right-wing populism protectionism . references . external links . patrick j . buchanan at openlibrary patrick j . buchanan at worldcat . archives . patrick j . buchanan papers ( white house special files ) ( 1969-1972 ) works by patrick j . buchanan at internet archive works by patrick j . buchanan at lewrockwell.com works by patrick j . buchanan at theamericancause.org -
