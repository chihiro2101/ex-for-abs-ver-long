Chaperone (protein)

location and functions . some chaperone systems work as foldase : they support the folding of proteins in an atp-dependent manner ( for example , the groel/groes or the dnak/dnaj/grpe system ) . although most newly synthesized proteins can fold in absence of chaperones , a minority strictly requires them for the same . other chaperones work as holdase : they bind folding intermediates to prevent their aggregation , for example dnaj or hsp33 . chaperones can also work as disaggregases , i.e . they can interact with aberrant protein assemblies and revent them to monomers . some chaperones can assist in protein degradation , leading proteins to protease systems , such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system in eukaryotes . many chaperones are heat shock proteins , that is , proteins expressed in response to elevated temperatures or other cellular stresses . the reason for this behaviour is that protein folding is severely affected by heat and , therefore , some chaperones act to prevent or correct damage caused by misfolding . macromolecular crowding may be important in chaperone function . the crowded environment of the cytosol can accelerate the folding process , since a compact folded protein will occupy less volume than an unfolded protein chain . however , crowding can reduce the yield of correctly folded protein by increasing protein aggregation . crowding may also increase the effectiveness of the chaperone proteins such as groel , which could counteract this reduction in folding efficiency . more information on the various types and mechanisms of a subset of chaperones that encapsulate their folding substrates ( e.g . groes ) can be found in the article for chaperonins . chaperonins are characterized by a stacked double-ring structure and are found in prokaryotes , in the cytosol of eukaryotes , and in mitochondria . other types of chaperones are involved in transport across membranes , for example membranes of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) in eukaryotes . a bacterial translocation—specific chaperone maintains newly synthesized precursor polypeptide chains in a translocation-competent ( generally unfolded ) state and guides them to the translocon . new functions for chaperones continue to be discovered , such as bacterial adhesin activity , induction of aggregation towards non-amyloid aggregates , suppression of toxic protein oligomers via their clustering , and in responding to diseases linked to protein aggregation ( e.g . see prion ) and cancer maintenance . . human chaperone proteins . chaperones are found in , for example , the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) , since protein synthesis often occurs in this area . endoplasmic reticulum . in the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) there are general , lectin- and non-classical molecular chaperones helping to fold proteins . general chaperones : grp78/bip , grp94 , grp170 . lectin chaperones : calnexin and calreticulin non-classical molecular chaperones : hsp47 and erp29 folding chaperones : protein disulfide isomerase ( pdi ) , peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase ( ppi ) , prolyl isomerase soluble complexes of target proteins and peptidyl prolyl isomerase . erp57 . nomenclature and examples of bacterial and archaeal chaperones . there are many different families of chaperones ; each family acts to aid protein folding in a different way . in bacteria like e . coli , many of these proteins are highly expressed under conditions of high stress , for example , when the bacterium is placed in high temperatures . for this reason , the term '' heat shock protein '' has historically been used to name these chaperones . the prefix '' hsp '' designates that the protein is a heat shock protein . hsp60 . hsp60 ( groel/groes complex in e . coli ) is the best characterized large ( ~ 1 mda ) chaperone complex . groel is a double-ring 14mer with a hydrophobic patch at its opening ; it is so large it can accommodate native folding of 54-kda gfp in its lumen . groes is a single-ring heptamer that binds to groel in the presence of atp or adp . groel/groes may not be able to undo previous aggregation , but it does compete in the pathway of misfolding and aggregation . also acts in matrix ( biology ) as molecular chaperone . hsp70 . hsp70 ( dnak in e . coli ) is perhaps the best characterized small ( ~ 70 kda ) chaperone . the hsp70 proteins are aided by hsp40 proteins ( dnaj in e . coli ) , which increase the atp consumption rate and activity of the hsp70s . it has been noted that increased expression of hsp70 proteins in the cell results in a decreased tendency toward apoptosis . although a precise mechanistic understanding has yet to be determined , it is known that hsp70s have a high-affinity bound state to unfolded proteins when bound to adp , and a low-affinity state when bound to atp . it is thought that many hsp70s crowd around an unfolded substrate , stabilizing it and preventing aggregation until the unfolded molecule folds properly , at which time the hsp70s lose affinity for the molecule and diffuse away . hsp70 also acts as a mitochondrial and chloroplastic molecular chaperone in eukaryotes . hsp90 . hsp90 ( htpg in e . coli ) may be the least understood chaperone . its molecular weight is about 90 kda , and it is necessary for viability in eukaryotes ( possibly for prokaryotes as well ) . heat shock protein 90 ( hsp90 ) is a molecular chaperone essential for activating many signaling proteins in the eukaryotic cell . each hsp90 has an atp-binding domain , a middle domain , and a dimerization domain . originally thought to clamp onto their substrate protein ( also known as a client protein ) upon binding atp , the recently published structures by vaughan et al . and ali et al . indicate that client proteins may bind externally to both the n-terminal and middle domains of hsp90 . hsp90 may also require co-chaperones-like immunophilins , sti1 , p50 ( cdc37 ) , and aha1 , and also cooperates with the hsp70 chaperone system . . hsp100 . hsp100 ( clp family in e . coli ) proteins have been studied in vivo and in vitro for their ability to target and unfold tagged and misfolded proteins . proteins in the hsp100/clp family form large hexameric structures with unfoldase activity in the presence of atp . these proteins are thought to function as chaperones by processively threading client proteins through a small 20 å ( 2 nm ) pore , thereby giving each client protein a second chance to fold . some of these hsp100 chaperones , like clpa and clpx , associate with the double-ringed tetradecameric serine protease clpp ; instead of catalyzing the refolding of client proteins , these complexes are responsible for the targeted destruction of tagged and misfolded proteins . hsp104 , the hsp100 of saccharomyces cerevisiae , is essential for the propagation of many yeast prions . deletion of the hsp104 gene results in cells that are unable to propagate certain prions . bacteriophage . the genes of escherichia virus t4 that encode proteins with a role in determining phage t4 structure were identified using conditional lethal mutants . edgar rs , epstein rh . the genetics of a bacterial virus . sci am . 1965 ;
