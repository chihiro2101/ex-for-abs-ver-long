The Durutti Column

history . early line-ups . in 1978 tony wilson and alan erasmus , later partners in factory records , assembled a band around the remnants of local punk rock band fast breeder , drummer chris joyce and guitarist dave rowbotham . the name was derived from a misspelling of the durruti column , an anarchist military unit in the spanish civil war , named after buenaventura durruti . the name was also taken from a four-page comic strip entitled '' le retour de la colonne durruti '' ( '' the return of the durruti column '' ) shadowplayers , p49 by andré bertrand , which was handed out amidst student protests in october 1966 at strasbourg university . shadowplayers , p29 on 25 january , vini reilly , former guitarist for local punk rock band the nosebleeds , joined , followed some weeks later by co-member vocalist phil rainford and , by the end of february , bassist tony bowers arrived from alberto y lost trios paranoias . the line-up was short-lived as rainford was sacked in july , and replaced by actor colin sharp , who also became one of the songwriters . rainford went on to produce for nico and suns of arqa . the durutti column played at the factory club ( organised by their managers ) , and cut two numbers for the first factory records release a factory sample , a double 7 '' compilation also featuring joy division , john dowie and cabaret voltaire . on the eve of recording a debut album , the band broke up after a dispute about wilson and erasmus 's choice of producer , martin hannett . rowbotham , bowers and joyce went on to form the mothmen ( the latter two becoming members of simply red some years later ) , sharp went on to form the roaring 80s , sf jive , and glow , and also dedicated himself to acting ; only reilly remained . with everyone 's departure , the durutti column defaulted to reilly 's solo project . other musicians contributed to recordings and live performances as occasioned . former alberto y lost trios paranoias drummer bruce mitchell doubled as co-manager with wilson throughout their career on factory and for many years afterwards . 1979–1990 : factory records . the first album , 1980 's the return of the durutti column ( title inspired by a 1967 situationist international poster that includes that phrase ) , was produced by martin hannett . reilly : '' . he more or less got sounds for me that no one else could understand that i wanted . and he understood that i wanted to play the electric guitar but i did n't want this horrible distorted , usual electric guitar sound and he managed to get that . '' the record featured a sandpaper sleeve ( like the title of the record , inspired by a situationist joke , a book – guy debord 's mémoires – with a sandpaper cover to destroy other books on the shelf ) . '' i did n't even know it was going to be an album . it was just the case of jumping at the chance of being in the studio . i actually did n't get up in time , martin had to physically get me out of bed to get me to the studio – that 's how little i believed it would happen . i was still doing late night petrol station shifts . i was even more amazed when tony presented me with a white label . i was completely baffled . 'what , this is really going to be an album ? you must be insane ! no-one 's going to buy this ! ' and then tony got the idea from the situationists about the sandpaper book , and decided to do some with a sandpaper sleeve . it was joy division that stuck the sandpaper onto the card . i was mortified . '' vini reilly : always the bridesmaid , never the bride . the quietus . the music was unlike anything else performed by post-punk acts at the time . reilly rooting himself in '' new wave '' with '' . an attempt at experimental things '' ; the record contained nine gentle guitar instrumentals ( later releases occasionally feature reilly 's soft and hesitant vocals ) including elements from jazz , folk , classical music and rock . reilly : '' . i had a lot of classical training when i was young , guitar and formal training , the scales i write with and the techniques i use are classical techniques and scales – a lot of minor melodic and minor harmonic scales , which generally are n't used in pop music . usually it 's pentatonic '' . hannett 's production included adding electronic rhythm and other effects , including birdsong on '' sketch for summer '' . the album was accompanied by a flexidisc with two tracks by hannett alone . lc ( '' lotta continua '' , italian for '' continuous struggle '' ) , released in 1981 , was recorded without hannett , and introduced percussionist bruce mitchell , reilly 's most frequent musical partner and occasional manager . it was recorded on a four-track cassette deck at home ( while it was slightly padded in the studio , the tape hiss is intact ) ; among the first crisp , professionally released recordings made cheaply at home . the durutti column : someone else 's party . pitchfork . the ep deux triangles , released in 1982 , contained three instrumentals , with piano emphasised over guitar . another setting ( 1983 ) was again reilly and mitchell ; in 1984 the band was expanded to include richard henry ( trombone ) , maunagh fleming ( cor anglais and oboe ) , blaine reininger ( of tuxedomoon ; violin and viola ) , mervyn fletcher ( saxophone ) , caroline lavelle ( cello ) , and tim kellett ( trumpet ) . the album without mercy , arranged by john metcalfe , was intended as an instrumental evocation of the poem la belle dame sans merci by john keats . say what you mean was a departure from roots with the addition of deep electronic percussion . durutti column . trouser press . kellett and metcalfe remained ( metcalfe playing viola ) ; they also appear alongside reilly and mitchell on circuses and bread ( factory benelux in 1985 ) and domo arigato . the latter is a live album recorded in tokyo and the first pop album released in the uk solely on the relatively new compact disc format ( and also available on vhs and laserdisc . ) kellett left to join simply red , but guested on the guitar and other machines ( 1987 ) , the first new uk album to be released on digital audio tape ( as well as the usual media of lp , audio cassette and cd ) . '' jes'like dat '' , underground , december 1987 ( issue 9 ) , p . 3 the guitar and other machines has a far more direct sound than earlier records , with guest vocals from stanton miranda and reilly 's then partner , pol , and the use of a sequencer and drum machine in addition to mitchell 's drumming . the album was produced by stephen street , who also produced morrissey 's solo album viva hate ( 1988 ) , on which reilly played guitar . reilly has said he was neither properly credited nor compensated for composing most of the music on viva hate . vini reilly ( 1989 ) , also produced by reilly and street , features extensive use of sampling , with looped samples of vocalists ( including otis redding , tracy chapman , annie lennox and joan sutherland ) used as the basis for several tracks . initial copies came with a 7 '' or cd single , '' i know very well how i got my note wrong '' , credited to '' vincent gerard and steven patrick '' , in which a take of the morrissey b-side '' i know very well how i got my name '' dissolves into laughter after reilly hits a wrong note . on obey the time ( 1990 ) mitchell played on only one track , the album being otherwise a solo recording by reilly , heavily influenced by techno music . the album 's title is a phrase uttered by the titular character of william shakespeare 's othello toward his fiance , desdemona in act one , scene two : '' i have but an hour of love , of worldly matters and direction , to spend with thee : we must obey the time . '' an accompanying single , '' the together mix '' , featured two reworkings of album tracks by together , jonathon donaghy and suddi raval ( donaghy was killed in a car crash in ibiza before the single was released ) . this was to be the last durutti column record released by factory , in early 1991 . 1990 onwards : after factory . for the first few years after the demise of factory , the only durutti column album releases were lips that would kiss ( a 1991 collection of early singles , compilation contributions and unreleased material on the separate label factory benelux ) , and dry ( 1991 ) and red shoes ( 1992 ) , italian collections of alternate versions and unreleased outtakes . former member dave rowbotham was killed by an unknown assailant in 1991 . he was later memorialised by the happy mondays in the song '' cowboy dave . '' in 1993 tony wilson attempted to revive factory records , and sex and death was the first release on factory too ( a subdivision of london records ) . the album was once again produced by stephen street , with mitchell and metcalfe , and it included , on the track '' the next time '' , peter hook of new order . time was gigantic . when we were kids , which followed in 1998 , was produced by keir stewart , who also played on the album and has frequently worked with reilly since . fidelity was released between these albums in 1996 by les disques du crépuscule and was produced by laurie laptop . the eight albums recorded for factory ( the return of the durutti column , lc , another setting , without mercy , domo arigato , the guitar and other machines , vini reilly and obey the time ) were re-released with additional material by factory too/london , under the banner factory once , between 1996 and 1998 . in 1998 , durutti column contributed '' it 's your life baby '' to the aids benefit compilation album onda sonora : red hot + lisbon produced by the red hot organization . factory too effectively ended in 1998 , and subsequent durutti column albums have been on independent labels artful records ( rebellion 2001 , someone else 's party 2003 , keep breathing 2006 , idiot savants 2007 ) or kookydisc ( tempus fugit 2004 , sunlight to blue . blue to blackness 2008 ) . kookydisc has also released two further volumes of the sporadic recordings ( along with a slightly edited re-release of the first volume from 1989 ) , remastered versions of two very scarce lps from the early 1980s ( live at the venue 2004 and amigos em portugal 2005 ) , and two subscription-club discs of rare and unreleased material . a download-only release , heaven sent ( it was called digital , it was heaven sent ) , first appeared in 2005 via wilson 's project f4 , which was marketed as the fourth version of factory records . on 7 september 2009 , colin sharp died from a brain haemorrhage . news from new writing north . 11 september 2009 . reilly suffered a stroke in 2011 , following which he was left unable to play the guitar the way he did before . durutti column guitarist vini reilly 'embarrassed ' by appeal . discography . chart placings shown are from the uk indie chart . . primary recordings . the return of the durutti column ( factory fact 14 , 1980 ) – original lp sleeve made of sandpaper – 1996 cd issue has same track listing and running order as the original sandpaper sleeve 'b1 ' and later black sleeve 'b3 ' vinyl pressings ( and is missing the extra track from the black sleeve 'b2 ' lp release ) ( no . & nbsp ;
