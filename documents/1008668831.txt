which were first made in 1740 by william eggleston . eggleston , a baker by trade , was a producer of a biscuit called grantham whetstones . whetstones were a rusk-like dry biscuit enjoyed locally and also by coach drivers who would stop in grantham to change horses while travelling along the great north road . according to folk belief , egglestone was baking whetstones in his dimly lit kitchen one morning when he mistook one ingredient for another , resulting in a ginger-like biscuit to emerge from the oven . the mistake was a huge success and the biscuit became established as grantham gingerbread , known as a white gingerbread because it is not made with molasses or black treacle . this provides a delicate ginger flavour , rich in butter , with a domed top that has a crackled surface . the centre is hollow and resembles a honeycomb . foods of england project . retrieved 31 december 2018 . . grantham journal . grantham 's local newspaper , the grantham journal , own site
