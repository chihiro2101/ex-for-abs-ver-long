Ludwig Tieck

early life . tieck was born in berlin , the son of a rope-maker . his siblings were the sculptor christian friedrich tieck and the poet sophie tieck . he was educated at the , where he learned greek and latin , as required in most preparatory schools . he also began learning italian at a very young age , from a grenadier with whom he became acquainted . through this friendship , tieck was given a first-hand look at the poor , which could be linked to his work as a romanticist . he later attended the universities of halle , göttingen , and erlangen . at göttingen , he studied shakespeare and elizabethan drama . on returning to berlin in 1794 , tieck attempted to make a living by writing . he contributed a number of short stories ( 1795 & ndash ; 98 ) to the series straussfedern , published by the bookseller c . f . nicolai and originally edited by j . k . a . musäus . he also wrote abdallah ( 1796 ) and a novel in letters , william lovell ( 3 vols , 1795 & ndash ; 96 ) . . adoption of romanticism . tieck 's transition to romanticism is seen in the series of plays and stories published under the title volksmärchen von peter lebrecht ( 3 vols . , 1797 ) , a collection containing the fairy tale der blonde eckbert , which blends exploration of the paranoiac mind with the realm of the supernatural , and a witty dramatic satire on berlin literary taste , der gestiefelte kater . with his school and college friend wilhelm heinrich wackenroder ( 1773–1798 ) , he planned the novel franz sternbalds wanderungen ( vols . i–ii . 1798 ) , which with wackenroder 's herzensergiessungen ( 1796 ) , was the first expression of the romantic enthusiasm for old german art . in 1798 tieck married and in the following year settled in jena , where he , the two brothers august and friedrich schlegel , and novalis were the leaders of the early romantic school ( also known as jena romanticism ) . his writings between 1798 and 1804 include the satirical drama , prinz zerbino ( 1799 ) , and romantische dichtungen ( 2 vols . , 1799–1800 ) . the latter contains tieck 's most ambitious dramatic poems , leben und tod der heiligen genoveva , leben und tod des kleinen rotkäppchens , which were followed in 1804 by the '' comedy '' in two parts , kaiser oktavianus . these dramas are typical plays of the first romantic school . although formless and destitute of dramatic qualities , they show the influence of both calderón and shakespeare . kaiser oktavianus is a poetic glorification of the middle ages . in 1801 tieck went to dresden , then lived for a time at cybinka near frankfurt , and spent many months in italy . in 1803 he published a translation of minnelieder aus der schwäbischen vorzeit , then between 1799 and 1804 an excellent version of don quixote , and in 1811 two volumes of elizabethan dramas , altenglisches theater . from 1812 to 1817 he collected in three volumes a number of his earlier stories and dramas , under the title phantasus . in this collection appeared the stories '' der runenberg '' , '' die elfen '' , '' der pokal '' , and the dramatic fairy tale '' fortunat '' . in 1817 tieck visited england in order to collect materials for a work on shakespeare , which was never finished . in 1819 he settled permanently in dresden , and from 1825 he was literary adviser to the court theatre . his semi-public readings from the dramatic poets gave him a reputation which extended far beyond the capital of the kingdom of saxony . the new series of short stories which he began to publish in 1822 also won him a wide popularity . notable among these are '' die gemälde '' , '' die reisenden '' , '' die verlobung '' , and '' des lebens überfluss '' . more ambitious and on a wider canvas are the historical or semi-historical novels dichterleben ( 1826 ) , der aufruhr in den cevennen ( 1826 , unfinished ) , and der tod des dichters ( 1834 ) . der junge tischlermeister ( 1836 ; but begun in 1811 ) is a work written under the influence of goethe 's wilhelm meister . his story of vittoria accorombona ( 1840 ) was written in the style of the french romanticists and shows a falling-off . . later years . in later years tieck carried on a varied literary activity as a critic ( dramaturgische blätter , 2 vols . , 1825–1826 ; kritische schriften , 2 vols . , 1848 ) . he also edited the translation of shakespeare by august wilhelm schlegel , who was assisted by tieck 's daughter dorothea ( 1790–1841 ) and by wolf heinrich , graf von baudissin ( 1789–1878 ) ; shakespeares vorschule ( 2 vols . , 1823–1829 ) ; and the works of heinrich von kleist ( 1826 ) and of jakob michael reinhold lenz ( 1828 ) . in 1841 friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia invited tieck to berlin , where he received a pension for his remaining years . he died in berlin on 28 april 1853 . . literary significance . tieck 's importance lay in the readiness with which he adapted himself to the emerging new ideas which arose at the close of the 18th century , as well as his romantic works , such as der blonde eckbert . his importance in german poetry , however , is restricted to his early period . in later years it was as the helpful friend and adviser of others , or as the well-read critic of wide sympathies , that tieck distinguished himself . tieck also influenced richard wagner 's tannhäuser . it was from phantasus that wagner based the idea of tannhäuser going to see the pope and of elisabeth dying in the song battle . works . tieck 's schriften appeared in twenty volumes ( 1828–1846 ) , and his gesammelte novellen in twelve ( 1852–1854 ) . nachgelassene schriften were published in two volumes in 1855 . there are several editions of ausgewählte werke by h . welti ( 8 vols . , 1886–1888 ) ; by j . minor ( in kirschner 's deutsche nationalliteratur , 144 , 2 vols . , 1885 ) ; by g . klee ( with an excellent biography , 3 vols . , 1892 ) , and g . witkowski ( 4 vols . , 1903 ) and marianne thalmann ( 4 vols . , 1963–66 ) . translations . '' the elves '' and '' the goblet '' were translated by thomas carlyle in german romance ( 1827 ) , '' the pictures '' and '' the betrothal '' by bishop thirlwall ( 1825 ) . a translation of vittoria accorombona was published in 1845 . a translation of '' des lebens überfluss '' ( '' life 's luxuries '' , by e . n . bennett ) appeared in german short stories in the oxford university press world 's classics series in 1934 , but the wit of the original comes over more strongly in the superfluities of life . a tale abridged from tieck , which appeared anonymously in blackwood 's edinburgh magazine in february 1845 . the journey into the blue distance ( das alte buch : oder reise ins blaue hinein , 1834 ) . '' the romance of little red riding hood '' ( 1801 ) was translated by jack zipes and included in his book '' the trials and tribulations of little red riding hood .
