De La Soul

history . early period . de la soul 's debut album , 3 feet high and rising , released in 1989 , was a critical smash hit in the hip hop genre . they quickly became prominent members of the native tongues posse along with a tribe called quest , black sheep , queen latifah , the jungle brothers and others . the single '' me myself and i '' became a huge hit , further cementing the group 's popularity . however , the sixties pop group the turtles sued de la soul for using a sample from their 1969 hit '' you showed me '' for the interlude track '' transmitting live from mars '' , despite the fact that the turtles did not actually write the original song . lyrically , much of 3 feet high and rising focused on striving for peace and harmony . 3 feet high and rising also introduced de la soul 's concept of the '' d.a.i.s.y . age '' ( an acronym standing for '' da inner sound , y'all '' ) . as a result , audiences were quick to peg the members of de la soul as hippies . this stereotype greatly agitated the group 's members , as they always envisioned their career as a constantly changing style ; this frustration would influence their next recording sessions . in the press kit for 3 feet high and rising , the members explained their pseudonym : trugoy when reversed spells yogurt , because he likes yogurt , and posdnuos spelled backwards is '' sound sop '' . the album artwork was designed by radical british artist collective the grey organisation de la soul 's second album , de la soul is dead ( 1991 ) was a much more mature album . it featured a wealth of material that criticized the violent , careless direction that hip hop was heading in at the time , though it still managed to maintain a light , absurd sense of humor . the cover of the album features a broken daisy flower pot , symbolizing the death of the '' d.a.i.s.y . age '' and the imagery that went along with it . the album spawned several singles , including the dark '' millie pulled a pistol on santa '' , a tale of a young girl who could no longer take the sexual abuse from her father , and the lead single '' ring ring ring ( ha ha hey ) '' , a story about the people rated with the black sheep on '' fanatic of the b word , '' q-tip from a tribe called quest on '' a roller skating jam named '' saturdays '' '' , and prince paul makes an appearance on the mic in '' pass the plugs '' with a verse of his own . the album also more prominently featured vincent mason as a rapper , providing verses of his own on '' bitties in the bk lounge , '' '' afro connections at a hi-5 , '' and '' ring ring ring ( ha ha hey ) '' . though it received mixed reviews and did not sell as well as 3 feet high and rising it eventually became a cult classic . the source magazine listed the album as one of their top 100 hip hop albums of all time , stating that '' its true genius is rarely understood '' . there are several major differences between the cd version of this album and the other formats , as the tracks '' johnny 's dead aka vincent mason '' , '' my brother 's a basehead '' , '' kicked out the house '' , and '' who do u worship ? '' are only available on the cd . the limited edition double vinyl promotional copies of the album distributed to the media before the official release did not feature these . middle period . the group 's third studio release , 1993 's buhloone mindstate , saw the group evolve a new sound as they continued to grow stylistically and musically . there were several moments on the album which proved the band had matured . '' i be blowin ' '' was a departure as the track was an instrumental featuring saxophone playing by maceo parker . the introspective '' i am i be '' showed de la soul at their most self-referential to date with subject matter about pos ' daughter ayana monet as well as his grandmother . '' long island wildin ' '' was a collaboration with japanese hip hop artists kan takagi ( major force ) and trio scha dara parr ( sdp ) . the album 's first single , '' breakadawn '' , used a sample of michael jackson 's '' i ca n't help it '' and smokey robinson 's '' quiet storm '' . de la soul collaborated for the first time with gang starr 's guru on '' patti dooke '' , female mc shortie no mas , a cousin of posdnuos , was prominent on many tracks on the album , showcased particularly '' in the woods '' . the album ended with an old school biz markie collaboration called '' stone age '' . missing from vocal duties is mase , whose voice can only be heard on '' area '' in a break near the end of the track . also rarely featured is his scratching which was heard often on previous albums , with only '' in the woods '' showcasing his talent in that area . the album was a critical success , but it was the biggest commercial failure for the group at the time of its release . many publications , such as rolling stone , have listed this album as one of the best hip hop albums of all time . in 1994 , 500 copies of a promotional ep called clear lake audiotorium were released on clear vinyl and cd . the 6 track ep contained edited versions of tracks off of buhloone mindstate but also featured the tracks '' sh.fe.mc 's '' ( shocking female mc 's ) which was a collaboration with a tribe called quest , and stix & stonz which featured old-school hip hop artists grandmaster caz , tito of fearless four , whipper whip , la sunshine and superstar . the ep was widely bootlegged afterwards . stakes is high ( 1996 ) was the first album not produced by prince paul , with overall production credits given solely to the trio . although it was met with poor sales , it has been critically lauded for its music , lyricism , and its overall message concerning the artistic decline rap music began to face in the mid-90s . the stakes is high ( song ) , produced by j dilla , was not a hit , but the album 's second single , '' itzsoweezee ( hot ) '' , with only dave on vocals , did fare better due to its creative music video . the album spawned a third single '' 4 more '' , featuring zhane which peaked at 52 in the uk . the album did provide a launching pad for future star rapper and actor mos def , who appeared on the track '' big brother beat '' . the album also featured collaborations with common , truth enola , and the jazzyfatnastees . later period . four years later , de la soul announced that they would release a triple album series entitled '' art official intelligence '' ( or aoi ) . all three albums were intended to be released within a year , beginning with the release of art official intelligence : mosaic thump . this was followed by aoi : bionix in late 2001 . after this , however , the third and final album in the aoi series was never released . for the next two years , the only de la soul releases were singles or remix compilations . david jude jolicoeur stated in an interview that it usually takes about four years for the group to record an album , promote it with advertisements , touring and so on . the group was having trouble finishing the last aoi installment for many reasons , one of which being an ongoing struggle with tommy boy records , which had been releasing its albums ever since its debut . in the summer of 2002 , de la soul toured with cake , modest mouse , the flaming lips , kinky , and the hackensaw boys during the unlimited sunshine tour . the band was briefly featured in the video game parappa the rapper 2 with the song '' say '' i got ta believe !
