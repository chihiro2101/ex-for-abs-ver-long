Zoltán Kodály

life . born in kecskemét , hungary , kodály learned to play the violin as a child . in 1905 he visited remote villages to collect songs , recording them on phonograph cylinders . in 1906 he wrote a thesis on hungarian folk song , '' strophic construction in hungarian folksong '' . at around this time kodály met fellow composer and compatriot béla bartók , whom he took under his wing and introduced to some of the methods involved in folk song collecting . the two became lifelong friends and champions of each other 's music . image : kodály zoltán pécs.jpg thumb left statue of kodály at szent istván square in pécs , hungary all these works show great originality of form and content , a very interesting blend of highly sophisticated mastery of the western european style of music , including classical , late-romantic , impressionistic and modernist traditions , and on the other hand a profound knowledge and respect for the folk music of hungary ( including the hungarian-inhabited areas of modern-day slovakia and romania , as those territories were part of hungary ) . partly because of the great war and subsequent major geopolitical changes in the region , and partly because of a naturally rather diffident temperament in youth , kodály had no major public success until 1923 . this was the year when one of his best-known pieces , psalmus hungaricus , was given its first performance at a concert to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the union of buda and pest ( bartók 's dance suite premiered on the same occasion . ) kodály 's first wife was emma gruber ( née schlesinger , later sándor ) , the dedicatee of ernő dohnányi 's waltz for piano with four hands , op . 3 , and variations and fugue on a theme by e.g . , op . 4 ( 1897 ) . in november 1958 , after 48 years of marriage , kodály 's first wife emma died . in december 1959 , kodály married sarolta péczely , his 19-year-old student at the franz liszt academy of music with whom he lived happily until his death in 1967 at the age of 84 in budapest . in 1966 , kodály toured the united states and gave a special lecture at stanford university , where some of his music was performed in his presence . . kodály method of musical education . throughout his adult life , kodály was very interested in the problems of many types of music education , and he wrote a large amount of material on teaching methods as well as composing plenty of music intended for children 's use . beginning in 1935 , along with his colleague jenő ádám ( 14 years his junior ) , he embarked on a long-term project to reform music teaching in hungary 's lower and middle schools . his work resulted in the publication of several highly influential books . the hungarian music education program that developed in the 1940s became the basis for the kodály method . although kodály himself did not write down a comprehensive method , he did establish a set of principles to follow in music education , and these principles were widely taken up by pedagogues ( above all in hungary , but also in many other countries ) after world war ii . his practices also have evolved kodály hand signs . in the motion picture close encounters of the third kind , a visual learning aid distributed to members of a conference of ufology was named the kodály method and referenced musical notes as hand signals . legacy and memorials . image : zoltan kodaly commemorative plaque.jpg thumb right commemorative plaque in andrássy út , budapest the city of pécs commissioned a full-length bronze statue , located in szent istván square , in his honour in 1976 . according to the wishes of the sculptor , the work stands with its back to the cathedral and facing a former playground , so that it was facing children , whose musical education was the most important thing in kodály 's life . he is depicted as a fragile old man , who walks almost imperceptibly among the horse-chestnut trees . at one point during the hungarian revolution of 1956 , the workers councils decide they should form the government with kodály as president '' because of his great national and international reputation .
