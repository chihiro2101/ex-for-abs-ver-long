Power chord

analysis . when two or more notes are played through a distortion process that nonlinearity transforms the audio signal , additional partials are generated at the sums and differences of the frequencies of the harmonics of those notes ( intermodulation distortion ) . doug coulter ( 2000 ) . digital audio processing , p.293 . '' any non-linearity produces harmonics as well as sum and difference frequencies between the original components . '' when a typical chord containing such intervals ( for example , a major or minor chord ) is played through distortion , the number of different frequencies generated , and the complex ratios between them , can make the resulting sound messy and indistinct . '' distortion – the physics of heavy metal '' , bbc this effect is accentuated as most guitars are tuned based on equal temperament , with the result that minor thirds are narrower , and major thirds wider , than they would be in just intonation . however , in a power chord , the ratio between the frequencies of the root and fifth are very close to the just interval 3:2 . when played through distortion , the intermodulation leads to the production of partials closely related in frequency to the harmonics of the original two notes , producing a more coherent sound . the intermodulation makes the spectrum of the sound expand in both directions , and with enough distortion , a new fundamental frequency component appears an octave lower than the root note of the chord played without distortion , giving a richer , more bassy and more subjectively 'powerful ' sound than the undistorted signal . robert walser ( 1993 ) . running with the devil , p.43 . even when played without distortion , the simple ratios between the harmonics in the notes of a power chord can give a stark and powerful sound , owing to the resultant tone ( combination tone ) effect . power chords also have the advantage of being relatively easy to play ( see '' fingering '' below ) , allowing fast chord changes and easy incorporation into melody and riffs . terminology . thumb theorists are divided on whether a power chord can be considered a chord in the traditional sense , with some requiring a 'chord ' to contain a minimum of three degrees of the scale . when the same interval is found in traditional and classical music , it would not usually be called a '' chord '' , and may be considered a dyad ( separated by an interval ) . however , the term is accepted as a pop and rock music term , most strongly associated with the overdriven electric guitar styles of hard rock , heavy metal , punk rock , and similar genres . the use of the term '' power chord '' has , to some extent , spilled over into the vocabulary of other instrumentalists , such as keyboard and synthesizer players . power chords are most commonly notated 5 or ( no 3 ) . for example , '' c5 '' or '' c ( no 3 ) '' refer to playing the root ( c ) and fifth ( g ) . these can be inverted , so that the g is played below the c ( making an interval of a fourth ) . they can also be played with octave doublings of the root or fifth note , which makes a sound that is subjectively higher pitched with less power in the low frequencies , but still retains the character of a power chord . another notation is ind , designating the chord as 'indeterminate' . this refers to the fact that a power chord is neither major nor minor , as there is no third present . this gives the power chord a chameleon-like property ; if played where a major chord might be expected , it can sound like a major chord , but when played where a minor chord might be expected , it sounds minor . history . the first written instance of a power chord for guitar in the twentieth century is to be found in the '' preludes '' of heitor villa-lobos , brazilian composer of the early twentieth century . although classical guitar composer francisco tárrega used it before him , modern musicians use villa-lobo ’ s version to this day . power chords ' use in rock music can be traced back to commercial recordings in the 1950s . robert palmer pointed to electric blues guitarists willie johnson and pat hare , both of whom played for sun records in the early 1950s , as the true originators of the power chord , citing as evidence johnson 's playing on howlin ' wolf 's '' how many more years '' ( recorded 1951 ) and hare 's playing on james cotton 's '' cotton crop blues '' ( recorded 1954 ) . scotty moore opened elvis presley 's 1957 hit '' jailhouse rock '' with power chords . a later hit song built around power chords was '' you really got me '' by the kinks , released in 1964 . this song 's riffs exhibit fast power-chord changes . the & nbsp ; who 's guitarist , pete & nbsp ; townshend , performed power chords with a theatrical windmill-strum , for example in '' my generation '' . on king crimson 's red album , robert fripp thrashed with power chords . : power chords are important in many forms of punk rock music . many punk guitarists used only power chords in their songs , most notably billie joe armstrong and doyle wolfgang von frankenstein . techniques . power chords are often performed within a single octave , as this results in the closest matching of overtones . octave doubling is sometimes done in power chords . power chords are often pitched in a middle register . image : f5chords.png shown above are four examples of an f5 chord . the letter names above the chords only indicate which different voicing is being used . these letter names should not be mistaken for the chord names typically used in popular music ( e.g . , c major , b minor , etc . ) a common voicing is the 1–5 perfect fifth ( a ) , to which the octave can be added , 1-5-1 ( b ) . a perfect fourth 5-1 ( c ) is also a power chord , as it implies the '' missing '' lower 1 pitch . either or both of the pitches may be doubled an octave above or below ( d is 5-1-5-1 ) , which leads to another common variation , 5-1-5 ( not shown ) . spider chords . thumb the spider chord is a guitar technique popularized during the 1980s thrash metal scene . regarded as being popularized and named by dave mustaine of megadeth , it is used to reduce string noise when playing ( mostly chromatic ) riffs that require chords across several strings . the chord or technique is used in the songs '' wake up dead '' , '' holy wars . the punishment due '' and '' ride the lightning '' .

( a bare fifth without octave doubling is the same , except that the highest of the three strings , in parentheses below , is not played . a bare fifth with the bass note on the second string has the same fingering as one on the fifth or sixth string . ) g5 a5 d5 e5 g5 a5 d5 a5 e -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ( 10 ) -- - ( 5 ) -- -- b -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ( 8 ) -- -- ( 10 ) -- -- 10 -- -- -5 -- -- - g -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ( 7 ) -- -- ( 9 ) -- -- -7 -- -- -- 9 -- -- -- 7 -- -- -- 2 -- -- - d -- -- ( 5 ) -- -- ( 7 ) -- -- -7 -- -- -- 9 -- -- -- 5 -- -- -- 7 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - a -- -- -5 -- -- -- 7 -- -- -- 5 -- -- -- 7 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - e -- -- -3 -- -- -- 5 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - an inverted barre fifth , i.e . a barre fourth , can be played with one finger , as in the example below , from the riff in smoke on the water by deep purple : g5/d bb5/f c5/g g5/d bb5/f db5/ab c5/g e -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- b -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- g -- -- -- 3—5 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -3—6 -- -5 -- -- -- -- d -- 5—3 -- -5 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -5—3 -- -6—5 -- -- -- -- -- a -- -5 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -5 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- e -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - -- -- -- 3—5 -- -3—0 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -5—3 -- -5—3 -- -0 -- -- -- - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -5 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - another implementation used is 5-1'-5 ' , that is , a note a fourth below the root , the root note , and a note a fifth above the root . ( this is sometimes called a '' fourth chord '' , but usually the second note is taken as the root , although it 's not the lowest one . ) when the strings are a fourth apart , the lower two notes are played with some fret on some two strings and the highest note is two frets higher on the next string . of course , using standard tuning , notes on the first or second string must be played one fret higher . d5 e5 g5 a5 d5 a5 d5 g5 e -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -5 -- -- -- 10 -- -- b -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -10 -- -- -5 -- -- -- 3 -- -- -- 8 -- -- - g -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -7 -- -- -- 9 -- -- -- 7 -- -- -- 2 -- -- - ( 2 ) -- -- ( 7 ) -- -- d -- -- -7 -- -- -- 9 -- -- -- 5 -- -- -- 7 -- -- - ( 7 ) -- -- ( 2 ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- a -- -- -5 -- -- -- 7 -- -- - ( 5 ) -- -- ( 7 ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- e -- -- ( 5 ) -- -- ( 7 ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- with the drop d tuning—or any other dropped tuning for that matter—power chords with the bass on the sixth string can be played with one finger , and d power chords can be played on three open strings . d5 e5 e -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- b -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- g -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- d -- 0 -- -- -- -2 -- -- - a -- 0 -- -- -- -2 -- -- - d -- 0 -- -- -- -2 -- -- - occasionally , open , '' stacked '' power chords with more than three notes are used in drop d . e -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 5 -- - b -- 3 -- -- -- -5 -- -- -- -7 -- -- -- -3 -- - g -- 2 -- -- -- -4 -- -- -- -6 -- -- -- -2 -- - d -- 0 -- -- -- -2 -- -- -- -4 -- -- -- -0 -- - a -- 0 -- -- -- -2 -- -- -- -4 -- -- -- -0 -- - d -- 0 -- -- -- -2 -- -- -- -4 -- -- -- -0 -- - . see also . overtone intermodulation electronic tuner . notes . references . . further reading . crawshaw , edith a . h .
