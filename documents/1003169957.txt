'' and while the inscription can certainly be read , certain passages are philologically uncertain on account of perceived complications of syntax and the vocabulary employed in the inscription , and as such they have become the source of debate among both semiticists and classicists . for the most recent analysis of the inscription and summary of the various scholarly interpretations , see schmitz , p . 1995 '' the phoenician text from the etruscan sanctuary at pyrgi .
