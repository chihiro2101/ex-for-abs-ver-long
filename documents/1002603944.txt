young actress mary pickford , who suggested she '' try pictures '' ; and in 1909 she invited florence to watch the making of a motion picture at the biograph studio in manhattan . given an impromptu bit part , florence was invited back to biograph 's studios to participate in another film later that year . she would go on to make several films under the renowned d . w . griffith , with her first credited film being in the 1909 film the politician 's love story , starring mack sennett and kathlyn williams . in 1911 , her career took a leap when she was hired by edwin thanhouser of the thanhouser film corporation in new rochelle , new york . with her sophistication and beauty , florence la badie soon became thanhouser 's most prominent actress , appearing in dozens of films over the next two years . her most remembered films of that period were the tempest ( 1911 ) , dr . jekyll and mr . hyde ( 1912 ) , a film adaptation of the robert louis stevenson story , and the first film of

six years la badie 's career had taken her to top-billing as a film actress . world war i . when world war i broke out in europe in 1914 , canada immediately joined the war , and as a result , several of florence la badie 's young male friends and relatives back home in montreal were immediately shipped overseas . she had many movie fans in canada and according to one new york newspaper , in 1915 a young soldier fighting in the trenches at the front in northern france wrote to her , sending dozens of photographs that graphically depicted the horrors of the war . deeply affected , la badie became

woman , would also soon be released , both on september 9 , 1917 . although the thanhouser corporation had been struggling since the 1914 automobile accident death of charles j . hite , her career was thriving and had been their saving grace . less than a month earlier , she had announced that she was leaving thanhouser , and she had several other film corporations willing to pick her up on contract immediately . on august 28 , 1917 , while driving near ossining , new york in the company of her fiance , daniel carson goodman , the brakes on la badie 's car failed and the vehicle plunged down a hill , overturning at the bottom . while goodman escaped with only a broken leg , la badie was thrown from the vehicle and suffered serious injuries , including a compound fracture of the pelvis . hospitalized , she clung to life for more than six weeks and seemed to be improving , but suddenly died on october 13 , from sepsis . she thus became the first major female film star to die while her career was at its peak , and the movie-going public mourned her death . after a large funeral , she was interred in an unmarked grave in the green-wood cemetery in brooklyn , new york , foster , charles . stardust and shadows : canadians in early hollywood . dundurn ( 2000 ) page 148 the same cemetery included by marie c . russ in her legal proceedings days before her death , with marie russ claiming to have been her actual birth mother in sworn deposition . obituary notices stated la badie was survived by her mother , amanda la badie , with no mention of her having been adopted . this omission would have been customary at the time . due to her death , it is unknown what her prolonged impact in films would have been . although little-remembered now , she was once a top-billed star . under new york laws , the property of her estate was divided between mr . and mrs . joseph la badie . in 2014 , ned thanhouser , the grandson of edwin thanhouser , raised money for a
