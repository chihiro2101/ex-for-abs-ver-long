Post-Impressionism

overview . the post-impressionists were dissatisfied with what they felt was the triviality of subject matter and the loss of structure in impressionist paintings , though they did not agree on the way forward . georges seurat and his followers concerned themselves with pointillism , the systematic use of tiny dots of colour . paul cézanne set out to restore a sense of order and structure to painting , to '' make of impressionism something solid and durable , like the art of the museums '' . huyghe , rene : impressionism . ( 1973 ) . secaucus , n.j . : chartwell books inc . , p . 222 . he achieved this by reducing objects to their basic shapes while retaining the saturated colours of impressionism . the impressionist camille pissarro experimented with neo-impressionism ideas between the mid-1880s and the early 1890s . discontented with what he referred to as romantic impressionism , he investigated pointillism , which he called scientific impressionism , before returning to a purer impressionism in the last decade of his life . cogniat , raymond ( 1975 ) . pissarro . new york : crown , pp . 69–72 . vincent van gogh used colour and vibrant swirling brush strokes to convey his feelings and his state of mind . although they often exhibited together , post-impressionist artists were not in agreement concerning a cohesive movement . yet , the abstract concerns of harmony and structural arrangement , in the work of all these artists , took precedence over naturalism . artists such as seurat adopted a meticulously scientific approach to colour and composition . caroline boyle-turner , post-impressionism , history and application of the term , moma , from grove art online , oxford university press , 2009 younger painters during the early 20th century worked in geographically disparate regions and in various stylistic categories , such as fauvism and cubism , breaking from post-impressionism . defining post-impressionism . image : lautrecx07.jpg thumb henri de toulouse-lautrec , portrait of émile bernard , 1886 , tate gallery london the term was used in 1906 , and again in 1910 by roger fry in the title of an exhibition of modern french painters : manet and the post-impressionists , organized by fry for the grafton galleries in london . manet and the post-impressionists ; nov . 8 to jan . 15 , 1910-11 , grafton galleries , london three weeks before fry 's show , art critic frank rutter had put the term post-impressionist in print in art news of 15 october 1910 , during a review of the salon d'automne , where he described othon friesz as a '' post-impressionist leader '' ; there was also an advert in the journal for the show the post-impressionists of france . most of the artists in fry 's exhibition were younger than the impressionists . fry later explained : '' for purposes of convenience , it was necessary to give these artists a name , and i chose , as being the vaguest and most non-committal , the name of post-impressionism . this merely stated their position in time relatively to the impressionist movement .

'' convenient , when the term is by definition limited to french visual arts derived from impressionism since 1886 . rewald 's approach to historical data was narrative rather than analytic , and beyond this point he believed it would be sufficient to '' let the sources speak for themselves . '' rival terms like modernism or symbolism were never as easy to handle , for they covered literature , architecture and other arts as well , and they expanded to other countries . modernism , thus , is now considered to be the central movement within international western civilization with its original roots in france , going back beyond the french revolution to the age of enlightenment . symbolism , however , is considered to be a concept which emerged a century later in france , and implied an individual approach . local national traditions as well as individual settings therefore could stand side by side , and from the very beginning a broad variety of artists practicing some kind of symbolic imagery , ranged between extreme positions : the nabis for example united to find synthesis of tradition and brand new form , while others kept to traditional , more or less academic forms , when they were looking for fresh contents : symbolism is therefore often linked to fantastic , esoteric , erotic and other non-realist subject matter . to meet the recent discussion , the connotations of the term 'post-impressionism ' were challenged again : alan bowness and his collaborators expanded the period covered forward to 1914 and the beginning of world war i , but limited their approach widely on the 1890s to france . other european countries are pushed back to standard connotations , and eastern europe is completely excluded . so , while a split may be seen between classical 'impressionism ' and 'post-impressionism ' in 1886 , the end and the extent of 'post-impressionism ' remains under discussion . for bowness and his contributors as well as for rewald , 'cubism ' was an absolutely fresh start , and so cubism has been seen in france since the beginning , and later in england . meanwhile , eastern european artists , however , did not care so much for western traditions , and proceeded to manners of painting called abstract and suprematic—terms expanding far into the 20th century . according to the present state of discussion , post-impressionism is a term best used within rewald 's definition in a strictly historical manner , concentrating on french art between 1886 and 1914 , and re-considering the altered positions of impressionist painters like claude monet , camille pissarro , auguste renoir , and others—as well as all new schools and movements at the turn of the century : from cloisonnism to cubism . the declarations of war , in july/august 1914 , indicate probably far more than the beginning of a world war—they signal a major break in european cultural history , too . along with general art history information given about '' post-impressionism '' works , there are many museums that offer additional history , information and gallery works , both online and in house , that can help viewers understand a deeper meaning of '' post-impressionism '' in terms of fine art and traditional art applications . post-impression in specific countries . canada . canadian post-impressionism is an offshoot of post-impressionism . in 1913 , the art association of montreal 's spring show included the work of randolph hewton , a . y . jackson and john lyman : it was reviewed with sharp criticism by the montreal daily witness and the montreal daily star . post-impressionism was extended to include a painting by lyman , who had studied with matisse . lyman wrote in defense of the term and defined it . he referred to the british show which he described as a great exhibition of modern art . artists and exhibitions . a wide and diverse variety of artists are called by this name in canada , among them are james wilson morrice , john lyman , david milne , and tom thomson , members of the group of seven , and emily carr . in 2001 , the robert mclaughlin gallery in oshawa organized the traveling exhibition the birth of the modern : post-impressionism in canada , 1900-1920 . gallery of major post-impressionist artists . file : les joueurs de cartes , par paul cézanne , metropolitan museum of art.jpg paul cézanne ( 1839–1906 ) file:1914 redon zyklop anagoria.jpg odilon redon ( 1840–1916 ) file : henri rousseau -
