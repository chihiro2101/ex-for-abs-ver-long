Skid Row (Irish band)

history . origins . the band was formed in august 1967 , comprising brendan 'brush ' shiels on bass guitar , noel 'nollaig ' bridgeman on drums , bernard '' ben '' cheevers on guitar , and phil lynott on vocals . shiels and cheevers had played together in a number of groups in dublin before forming skid row . the band 's first gig was in september 1967 in a basement club in lower abbey street in dublin 1 . cheevers left the band in september 1968 to continue working full-time in the electrical industry . before his departure , the search for a suitably proficient guitarist resulted in gary moore joining the band as a fifth member . moore and cheevers both played in the band for a short 'hand-over ' period . robbie brennan temporarily replaced original drummer bridgeman until june 1969 and cheevers was replaced by the 16-year-old gary moore in mid 1968 , and the band recorded a single , '' new places , old faces '' / '' misdemeanour dream felicity '' , for the irish song records label ( the only released recording of lynott with skid row ) . later that year shiels dropped lynott from the line-up , converting skid row to a power trio by making himself the lead vocalist . a brief history of skid row on the brush shiels – skid row website by way of compensation , shiels gave him a bass guitar he had bought from former musician robert ballagh for £49 in 1967 while with the uptown band , he taught lynott to play bass and , after a stint with 'orphanage ' , lynott went on to international fame as founder , bassist and vocalist for thin lizzy . hot press : special philip lynott issue ( 24 february 2011 ) the band recorded a second single for 'song ' , '' saturday morning man '' / '' mervyn aldridge '' . these two singles , plus three tracks from a bbc recording , were issued on the 'hux ' label as live and on song in april 2006 . at the end of 2006 a number of skid row demo tapes featuring phil lynott were discovered . these were his earliest recordings ( from 1968 ) and had been presumed lost for decades . . skid and 34 hours . with the returning bridgeman , skid row played support to some of the great rock groups of the 1960s , including fleetwood mac in january 1970 . moore was influenced by the fleetwood mac guitarist peter green , who was in turn impressed by moore 's guitar playing and introduced him to the columbia/cbs record company . a third single , '' sandie 's gone ( part 1 ) '' / '' sandie 's gone ( part 2 ) '' , was released on the band 's new label in april 1970 , and a number of sessions and concerts were also recorded for the bbc during this period . the band released its first album skid , in october 1970 . a second lp , 34 hours – so called because it took them a mere 34 hours to record it – was released in early 1971 , preceded by the single '' night of the warm witch '' / '' mr . de-luxe '' . skid row performed on the legendary german tv music show beat club on 18 march 1971 . there were short tours of europe ( october 1970 , with canned heat ) and of the usa ( october/november 1970 and august and october 1971 ) . a widely bootlegged show billed as '' the whiskey , los angeles , august 5 , 1970 '' , and featuring john bonham as a guest , is more likely from august 1971 . a third album was recorded in the autumn of 1971 but moore left the band in december 1971 just before another planned us tour . he was temporarily replaced by eric bell ( from thin lizzy ) for some live appearances before paul chapman became the band 's full-time guitarist . moore later played with thin lizzy , replacing eric bell . chapman overdubbed moore 's guitar tracks on the unreleased album but neither version was made public for almost twenty years . as the band faltered , chapman left in july 1972 ( later joining ufo ) . shiels then teamed with drummer john wilson ( ex-them , taste and stud ) and future sparks guitarist adrian fisher to form a band named simply 'brush ' . changing lineups . skid row reformed in ireland in 1973 , initially with shiels , wilson , singer eamonn gibney ( ex-alyce ) and guitarist ed deane , later adding keyboard player kevin mcalea . gibney would later join colm wilkinson and helen jordan to sing as the dajacs at the 1980 irish final for the eurovision song contest placing 7th . shiels/deane/wilson line-up released the single '' dublin city angels '' / '' slow down '' ( in 1971 according to deane 's website , but this seems too early ) . john wilson was replaced by paddy freeney before the band split again in early 1974 . for the next few months shiels played in the 'bell-brush band ' with eric bell and timmy creedon ( drums , ex-orphanage ) , sometimes joined by eamonn gibney . at the end of the year shiels , moore and bridgeman briefly reunited for a series of gigs , and a 1975 line-up of shiels ( guitar/vocals ) , bridgeman , jimi slevin ( lead guitar/vocals , ex-alyce , ex-peggy 's leg ) ( born june 1950 , dublin ) , timmy creedon ( second drummer/vocals ) and johann brady ( bass ) recorded the skid row single '' the spanish lady '' / '' elvira '' . in 1976 jody pollard ( guitar , ex-elmer fudd ) replaced pat o'farrell in a line-up with shiels ( vocals/mandolin ) , bridgeman ( drums ) , john brady ( bass ) and dave gaynor ( drums ) , recording the phil lynott-produced double a-sided single '' coming home again '' / '' fight your heart out '' and unreleased track '' skid row flashback '' . the 1976 double-disc live album of rock n ' roll standards alive and kickin featured shiels , bridgeman , brady , pollard , gaynor and ian anderson . in 1978 pollard rejoined , this time replacing eric bell alongside shiels , bridgeman , brady and joe staunton ( guitar , ex-orphanage ) . . legacy . john brady was killed in a car accident on 15 february 1993 , phil lynott died of septicaemia in january 1986 and gary moore died from a heart attack in february 2011 . skid row had little commercial success outside ireland and the uk , although skid reached no.30 on the uk albums chart . more of their recorded material was released between 1990 and 2006 . it was reported that in 1987 , jon bon jovi asked gary moore to sell the name 'skid row ' to the american heavy metal band for 35,000 ( bon jovi part-owns the music publishing rights of this band ) . lead singer sebastian bach recalled , however , shiels maintains that moore simply referred the band to shiels to discuss the rights to the name , but that it was never followed up . did bon jovi give skid row a 'bad name ' ? – examiner ( 17 january 2012 ) shiels still occasionally performs as 'brush shiels ' skid row ' , as recently as february 2005 . bridgeman went on to perform studio work with clannad , the waterboys and altan and was part of irish folk singer mary black 's band in the late 1980s and early 1990s . brush shiels returned to his skid row legacy once more releasing mad dog woman ( originally titled skid row revisited ) – an album of new material and re-recordings of skid row songs – through his website in june 2009 . he also thanked the other skid row '' for the generosity of spirit in acknowledging the contribution of the original skid row '' by using the name . in january 2012 shiels issued a public request to jon bon jovi via youtube to contact him about the use of the name 'skid row ' . this was connected to shiels having recently recovered the rights to his own songs recorded with the original skid row . they were managed in the 1970s by oliver byrne . band members . brush shiels – bass , vocals ( 1967–1972 , 1973–1976 , 2012
