'' gielgud ( 1965 ) , p . 31 on leaving westminster in 1921 , gielgud persuaded his reluctant parents to let him take drama lessons on the understanding that if he was not self-supporting by the age of twenty-five he would seek an office post . gielgud ( 1979 ) , p . 48 . first acting experience . gielgud , aged seventeen , joined a private drama school run by constance benson , wife of the actor-manager sir frank benson . hayman , p . 18 on the new boy 's first day lady benson remarked on his physical awkwardness : '' she said i walked like a cat with rickets . it dealt a severe blow to my conceit , which was a good thing . '' '' profile – the old master of rhetoric and robes '' , the observer , 14 april 1974 , p . 9 before and after joining the school he played in several amateur productions , gielgud ( 2000 ) , p . 41 and in november 1921 made his debut with a professional company , though he himself was not paid . he played the herald in henry v at the old vic ; he had one line to speak and , he recalled , spoke it badly . gielgud ( 2000 ) , pp . 45–46 he was kept on for the rest of the season in walk-on parts in king lear , wat tyler and peer gynt , with no lines . gaye , p . 643 ; and gielgud ( 2000 ) , p . 46 gielgud 's first substantial engagement came through his family . in 1922 his cousin phyllis neilson-terry invited him to tour in j . & nbsp ; b . fagan 's the wheel , as understudy , bit-part player and assistant stage manager , an invitation he accepted . a colleague , recognising that the young man had talent but lacked technique , recommended him to the royal academy of dramatic art ( rada ) . gielgud was awarded a scholarship to the academy and trained there throughout 1923 under kenneth barnes , helen haye and claude rains . gielgud ( 2000 ) , p . 51 the actor-manager nigel playfair , a friend of gielgud 's family , saw him in a student presentation of j . & nbsp ; m . barrie 's the admirable crichton . playfair was impressed and cast him as felix , the poet-butterfly , in the british premiere of the čapek brothers ' the insect play . gielgud later said that he made a poor impression in the part : '' i am surprised that the audience did not throw things at me . '' gielgud ( 2000 ) , p . 53 the critics were cautious but not hostile to the play ; ervine , st john . '' the insect play '' , the observer , 6 may 1923 , p . 15 ; brown , ivor .

'' morley , p . 43 . early west end roles . between gielgud 's first two oxford seasons , the producer barry jackson cast him as romeo to the juliet of gwen ffrangcon-davies at the regent 's theatre , london , in may 1924 . the production was not a great success , but the two performers became close friends and frequently worked together throughout their careers . gielgud ( 1979 ) , p . 63 gielgud made his screen debut during 1924 as daniel arnault in walter summers 's silent film who is the man ? ( 1924 ) . gielgud ( 2000 ) , p . 197 in may 1925 the oxford production of the cherry orchard was brought to the lyric theatre , hammersmith . gielgud again played trofimov . '' lyric theatre , hammersmith '' , the times , 26 may 1925 , p . 14 his distinctive speaking voice attracted attention and led to work for bbc radio , which his biographer sheridan morley calls '' a medium he made his own for seventy years '' . in the same year noël coward chose gielgud as his understudy in his play the vortex . for the last month of the west end run gielgud took over coward 's role of nicky lancaster , the drug-addicted son of a nymphomaniac mother . it was in gielgud 's words '' a highly-strung , nervous , hysterical part which depended a lot upon emotion '' . gielgud ( 1979 ) , p . 61 he found it tiring to play because he had not yet learned how to pace himself , but he thought it '' a thrilling engagement because it led to so many great things afterwards '' . the success of the cherry orchard led to what one critic called a '' chekhov boom '' in british theatres , and gielgud was among its leading players . croall ( 2000 ) , p . 69 as konstantin in the seagull in october 1925 he impressed the russian director theodore komisarjevsky , who cast him as tusenbach in the british premiere of three sisters . the production received enthusiastic reviews , and gielgud 's highly praised performance enhanced his reputation as a potential star . croall ( 2000 ) , p . 73 there followed three years of mixed fortunes for him , with successes in fringe productions , but west end stardom was elusive . croall ( 2011 ) , p . 74 in 1926 the producer basil dean offered gielgud the lead role , lewis dodd , in a dramatisation of margaret kennedy 's best-selling novel , the constant nymph . before rehearsals began dean found that a bigger star than gielgud was available , namely coward , to whom he gave the part . gielgud had an enforceable contractual claim to the role , but dean , a notorious bully , was a powerful force in british theatre . croall ( 2000 ) , p . 89 roose-evans , james . '' dean , basil herbert ( 1888–1978 ) '' , oxford dictionary of national biography , oxford university press , online edition , january 2011 , retrieved 12 august 2014 intimidated , gielgud accepted the position of understudy , with a guarantee that he would take over the lead from coward when the latter , who disliked playing in long runs , left . croall ( 2011 ) , pp . 85–86 in the event coward , who had been overworking , suffered a nervous collapse three weeks after the opening night , and gielgud played the lead for the rest of the run . the play ran for nearly a year in london and then went on tour . gielgud ( 2000 ) , pp . 93–94 by this time gielgud was earning enough to leave the family home and take a small flat in the west end . he had his first serious romantic relationship , living with john perry , an unsuccessful actor , later a writer , who remained a lifelong friend after their affair ended . morley makes the point that , like coward , gielgud 's principal passion was the stage ; both men had casual dalliances , but were more comfortable with '' low-maintenance '' long-term partners who did not impede their theatrical work and ambitions . morley , p . 56 in 1928 gielgud made his broadway debut as the grand duke alexander in alfred neumann 's the patriot . the play was a failure , closing after a week , but gielgud liked new york and received favourable reviews from critics including alexander woollcott and brooks atkinson . hayman , p . 46 ; and atkinson , brooks . '' the play – imperial tragedy '' , the new york times , 20 january 1928 , p . 15 after returning to london he starred in a succession of short runs , including ibsen 's ghosts with mrs patrick campbell ( 1928 ) , and reginald berkeley 's the lady with a lamp ( 1929 ) with edith evans and gwen ffrangcon-davies . in 1928 he made his second film , the clue of the new pin .
