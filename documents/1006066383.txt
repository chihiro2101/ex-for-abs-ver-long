Johann Gustav Droysen

early life and education . droysen was born at treptow in pomerania ( now trzebiatów in poland ) on 6 july 1808 . his father , johann christoph droysen , was an army chaplain who had been present at the celebrated siege of kolberg in 1806–1807 . as a child , droysen witnessed some of the military operations during the war of liberation , his father by then being pastor at gryfino , in the immediate neighbourhood of stettin , which was held by the french for most of 1813 . these youthful impressions laid the foundation of his ardent attachment to the kingdom of prussia . he was educated at the gymnasium of stettin and at the university of berlin ; from 1827 to 1829 he was the private tutor of felix mendelssohn , who set several of his poems in his op . 9 12 songs . in 1829 he became a master at the graues kloster , one of the oldest schools in berlin ; in addition , he gave lectures at the university of berlin , from 1833 as privatdozent , and from 1835 as professor , without a salary . the famed historian jacob burckhardt visited his class in his last semester ( 1839–40 ) . nippel , wilfried . johann gustav droysen : ein leben zwischen wissenschaft und politik . c.h . beck , 2008 , , p . 20 . during these years droysen studied classical antiquity ; he published a translation of aeschylus in 1832 and a paraphrase of aristophanes ( 1835–1838 ) , nippel ( 2008 ) , p . 7 . but the work by which he made himself known as a historian was his geschichte alexanders des grossen ( history of alexander the great ; berlin , 1833 and other editions ) , a book that long remained the best work on alexander the great . nippel ( 2008 ) , p . 8 . it was in some ways the herald of a new school of german historical thought , for it idealized power and success , a conceptual framework droysen had learned from the teaching of hegel . droysen followed the biography of alexander with other works dealing with alexander 's diadochi , published under the title of geschichte des hellenismus ( hamburg , 1836–1843 ) , in which he created the term '' hellenistic '' to refer to the period between alexander 's conquests and the emergence of the roman empire . a new and revised edition of the whole work was published in 1885 , and translated into french , but not at the time into english . his vorlesung des freiheits krieg ( in english : lectures of the war of liberation ) nippel , p . appeared in 1846 and his outlines of the principles of history , published 1858 , translated 1893 , was widely read throughout german universities .

'' we can not conceal the fact that the whole german question is a simple alternative between prussia and austria . in these states , german life has its positive and negative poles — in the former , all the interests which are national and reformative , in the latter , all that are dynastic and destructive . the german question is not a constitutional question , but a question of power ; and the prussian monarchy is now wholly german , while that of austria can not be .
