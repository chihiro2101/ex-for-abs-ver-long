in controversy when taking a quick single from the bowling of john snow . they collided , and gavaskar fell over . snow was charged with deliberately barging into gavaskar and was suspended . gavaskar 's 144 runs at the low average of 24 , test batting and fielding in each season by sunny gavaskar , cricketarchive . retrieved 5 september 2008 . led some to question gavaskar 's worthiness for international cricket . . england tour of india . in 1972–73 , england toured india for a five-test series , gavaskar 's first on home soil . he was ineffective in the first three tests , accumulating only sixty runs in five innings as india took a 2–1 lead . he scored some runs in the final two tests which india drew to complete consecutive series wins over england . his first home series was largely disappointing , aggregating 224 runs at 24.89 . his english critics were placated when india returned in 1974 and gavaskar scored 101 and 58 in the second test at old trafford . he managed 227 runs at 37.83 as india were whitewashed 3–0 . . west indies tour . gavaskar 's 1974–75 series against the west indies was interrupted , playing in only the first and fifth and final test of the series against the west indies . he scored 108 runs at 27 , with an 86 bowled by lance gibbs at bombay 's wankhede stadium hosting the first test on this ground , the closest the indian public got to see a century . the test was the start of a world record streak of 106 test appearances . the 1975–76 season saw three and four test tours of new zealand and the west indies , respectively . gavaskar led india in a test for the first time in january 1976 against new zealand during the first test in auckland when regular captain bishen bedi was suffering from a leg injury . standing in despite having scored only 703 runs at 28.12 since his debut series , gavaskar rewarded the selectors with 116 and 35 . as a result , india secured an eight-wicket victory . he ended the series with 266 runs at 66.33 . on the west indian leg of the tour , gavaskar scored consecutive centuries of 156 and 102 in the second and third tests , both in port of spain , trinidad . these were his third and fourth centuries at the grounds . in the third test , his 102 helped india post 4/406 to set a world record for the highest winning fourth innings score . the indians ' mastery of the caribbean spinners on a turning track reportedly led west indian captain clive lloyd to vow that he would rely on pace alone in future tests . gavaskar totalled 390 runs at 55.71 for the series . . first home test century . gavaskar was not to score a century on home soil until november 1976 . in an eight-test season , three and five against new zealand and england , respectively , gavaskar scored centuries in the first and last tests of the season . the first was 119 in front of his home crowd at the wankhede stadium , helping india to a victory . gavaskar scored another half-century in the second test to end the series with 259 at 43.16 . in the first test against england at delhi , he was mobbed upon becoming the first indian to reach 1,000 test runs in a calendar year . a steady series saw him finish with 394 runs at 39.4 with a century coming in the fifth test and two half-centuries . . tour of australia . in 1977–78 he toured australia , scoring three consecutive test centuries ( 113 , 127 , 118 ) in the second innings of the first three tests at brisbane , perth and melbourne , respectively . india won the third but lost the earlier two . he finished the five test series with 450 runs at 50 , failing twice as india lost the final test and the series 3–2 . . india tour of pakistan . 1978–79 saw india tour pakistan for the first series between the arch-rivals for 17 years . for the first time , gavaskar faced pakistani pace spearhead imran khan , who described him as '' the most compact batsman i 've bowled to . '' gavaskar scored 89 in the first test and 97 in the second , which india drew and lost , respectively . gavaskar saved his best for the third test in karachi , scoring 111 and 137 in the third , but was unable to prevent a defeat and series loss . his twin centuries made him the first indian to score two centuries in one test on two occasions , and saw him pass umrigar as india 's leading test run-scorer . gavaskar finished the series with 447 runs at 89.40 . . captaincy . emerged as a leading pace bowler for the country . he captained india to nine victories and eight losses , but most of the games were drawn , 30 . first test series as a captain . his first series in charge was a west indian visit to india for a six test series . gavaskar 's several large centuries contrasted with several failures . his 205 in the first test made him the first indian to score a double century in india against the west indies . he added a further 73 in the second innings of a high scoring draw . after failing to score in the second test , he scored 107 and 182 not out in the third test at calcutta , another high scoring draw . this made him the first player in test history to achieve centuries in both innings of a test three times . he managed only 4 and 1 in the fourth test in madras as india forced the only win of the series . he posted a fourth century for the series , scoring 120 in the fifth test at delhi , becoming the first indian to pass 4000 test runs . he aggregated 732 runs at 91.50 for the series , securing india a 1–0 win in his first series as captain . . stripped of the captaincy . despite this , he was stripped of the captaincy when india toured england in 1979 for a four test tour . the official reason given was that srinivas venkataraghavan was preferred due to his superior experience on english soil , but most observers believed that gavaskar was punished because he was believed to be considering defecting to world series cricket . he started consistently , scoring four half-centuries in five innings of the first three tests . it was in the fourth test at the oval that he produced his finest innings on english soil . india was 1–0 down needed to reach a world record target of 438 to square the series . they reached 76/0 at stumps on the fourth day . led by gavaskar , india made steady progress to be 328/1 with 20 overs remaining on the final day with a record-breaking victory still possible . an ian botham led fightback saw gavaskar removed , with india still needing 49 runs from 46 balls . with three balls left in the match , all four results were possible . india ended nine runs short with two wickets in hand when stumps were drawn . according to sanjay manjrekar , it was '' vintage gavaskar , playing swing bowling to perfection , taking his time initially and then opening up . nothing in the air , everything copybook . '' he ended the series with 542 runs at 77.42 and was named as one of the wisden cricketers of the year . . restored to captaincy . gavaskar was restored to the captaincy for the gruelling 1979–80 season , with six test home series against both australia and pakistan . the first two tests against australia were high scoring draws where only 45 wickets fell , with india taking a first-innings lead in both after making scores over 400 . india broke through for a 153-run win in the third test at kanpur , where gavaskar scored 76 . he made 115 in the fourth test in delhi , where india were unable to convert a 212-run first innings lead , resulting in a draw . after another stalemate in the fifth test , gavaskar scored 123 in the sixth test , where australia collapsed by an innings after india posted their fourth first innings in excess of 400 for the series . the series against pakistan was similarly high scoring , with four draws , three of which did not reach the fourth innings . india won the third and fifth tests in bombay and madras . at madras , he made 166 in the first innings and was unbeaten on 29 when india brought up the winning runs . having secured the series 2–0 , gavaskar was removed from the captaincy for the drawn sixth test . this occurred because gavaskar had refused to tour the west indies for another series immediately afterwards , asking for a rest . as a result , gundappa viswanath was appointed so that he could prepare his leadership skills for the tour . in the end the tour did not go ahead as the west indian board were not interested in a team without gavaskar . the season ended with a one-off test against england in bombay , which india lost . in the 13 tests that season , he made 1027 runs at 51.35 with three centuries and four half-centuries . this ended a 14-month span in which gavaskar played in 22 tests and the 1979 cricket world cup . in that time , he scored 2301 test runs including eight centuries . . australian tour . the 1980–81 season saw gavaskar returned as captain for the australasian tour , but it was to be the start of an unhappy reign for gavaskar and india . he managed only 118 runs at 19.66 in the three tests against australia , but his impact in australia was for a controversial incident . at the melbourne cricket ground , when gavaskar was given out by the australian umpire rex whitehead , he ordered his fellow opener chetan chauhan off the field . instead of abandoning the match , the indian manager , sk durani persuaded chauhan to return to the match which india went on to win by 59 runs as australia collapsed to 83 in their second innings . india drew the series 1–1 but the following three-test series in new zealand was to signal the start of a barren run of 19 tests under gavaskar of which india were to win only one and lose five . india lost to new zealand 1–0 , with gavaskar managing 126 runs at 25.2 . he finished the oceania tour with 244 runs at 22.18 , with only two half-centuries , making little impact . . england in india . the 1981–82 indian season saw a hard-fought 1–0 series win over england in six tests . india took the first test , before five consecutive draws resulted , four of which did not even reach the fourth innings . gavaskar made 172 in the second test at bangalore and reached a half-century on three further occasions to compile 500 runs at 62.5 . india reciprocated england 's visit in 1982 for a three-test series , which was lost 1–0 . gavaskar made 74 runs at 24.66 but was unable to bat in the third test . . sri lanka tour . the 1982–83 subcontinental season started well for gavaskar on an individual note , as he made 155 in a one-off test against sri lanka in madras . it was the first test between the two nations , with sri lankan having only recently been awarded test status . despite this , india were unable to finish off their novice opponents , the draw heralding a start of a winless summer . india played in twelve tests , losing five and drawing seven . the first series was a six test tour to pakistan . india started well enough , drawing the first test in lahore , with gavaskar scoring 83 . pakistan then defeated india in three consecutive matches . in the third test in faisalabad , gavaskar managed an unbeaten 127 in the second innings to force pakistan into a run chase , but the other two losses were substantial , both by an innings . despite holding on for draws in the last two tests , gavaskar was replaced by kapil dev as captain after the 3–0 loss . despite his team 's difficulties , gavaskar remained productive with 434 runs at 47.18 with a century and three half centuries . gavaskar went on to the west indies for a five test tour purely as a batsman , but could not reproduce the form that he had shown in the caribbean in 1971 and 1976 . he managed only 240 runs at 30 , as india were crushed 2–0 by the world champions . apart from an unbeaten 147 in the drawn third test in georgetown , guyana , his next best effort was 32 . the 1983–84 season started with a home series against pakistan , with all three matches being drawn . gavaskar scored an unbeaten 103 in the first test in bangalore , and made two further half centuries to total 264 runs at 66 . overtaking bradman 's test record . the pakistan series was followed by a six test series against the touring west indies at the height of their powers . the first test was held in kanpur and india were crushed by an innings . gavaskar had his bat knocked out of his hand by a hostile delivery from malcolm marshall before being dismissed . in the second test in delhi , gavaskar delivered his riposte to marshall , hooking him for a consecutive four and six to start his innings . gavaskar , unwilling to be dictated to by the caribbean pacemen , hooked the short-pitched barrage relentlessly , reaching his half century in 37 balls . he then went on to score 121 , his 29th test century in 94 balls in his 95th test match , equalling don bradman 's world record . he also passed 8,000 test runs in the innings , and was personally honoured by indira gandhi , the prime minister of india at the ground . the match was drawn . gavaskar 's 90 in the third test at ahmedabad saw him pass geoff boycott 's test world record of 8,114 career runs , but was insufficient to prevent another defeat . during the fifth test in the series , india were defeated by an innings at calcutta to concede a 3–0 series lead . india had won only one of their 32 most recent tests and none of their last 28 . the crowd singled out the gavaskar , who had made a golden duck and 20 . angry spectators pelted objects onto the playing arena and clashed with police , before stoning the team bus . in the sixth test in madras , he compiled his 30th test century in his 99th test match , with an unbeaten 236 which was the highest test score by an indian . it was his 30th test century and third double century against the west indies , propelling him to overtake donald bradman 's 29 test centuries record . he had aggregated 505 at 50.50 for the series . . failure to win for successive tests . with india having failed to win for 29 successive tests , kapil was sacked as captain and gavaskar resumed leadership at the start of the 1984–85 season . the two test tour of pakistan resulted in two further draws , with gavaskar compiling 120 runs at 40 . the first test against england saw india break through for its first test victory in 32 matches . it proved to be a false dawn , with england squaring the series 1–1 in delhi before another controversial third test at eden gardens in calcutta . the hostile crowd watched as india batted for over two days to reach 7/437 after 203 overs . angry with the slow pace of india 's innings , the crowd chanted '' gavaskar down ! gavaskar out ! '' blaming him for india ' performance . the local police chief reportedly asked gavaskar to declare to placate the angry crowd . when gavaskar led his team onto the field , he was pelted with fruit . gavaskar vowed never to play at eden gardens again , and duly withdrew from the team for india 's next fixture at the bengali capital two years later , ending his record of 106 consecutive tests . the match was drawn , but india conceded the series after losing the fourth . the series ended 1–2 , and with a poor display of 140 runs at 17.5 , gavaskar resigned , although he had already announced his intention to relinquish the leadership before the series . the change of captain improved the form of neither gavaskar nor india as they toured sri lanka for a three-test series . india were embarrassed 1–0 by the test minnows at the time , with gavaskar managing only 186 runs at 37.2 . . international farewell . in 1985–86 , india toured australia , playing against a team in a poor form slump . india were unable to capitalise as all three tests were drawn , but gavaskar did . he scored an unbeaten 166 in the first test in adelaide and 172 in the third test in sydney , ending the series with 352 runs at 117.33 . a three-test tour of england saw him score only 185 runs at 30.83 , which india won 2–0 despite his unproductivity . in 1986–87 , gavaskar 's final season in test cricket , india faced a long season of eleven home tests . against a team regarded as the worst to leave australian shores , gavaskar made 90 in the second innings of the first test in madras ( now chennai ) , giving india a chance to reach the target of 348 , which ended in a tie . he scored 103 in the third test to end the series with 205 runs at 51.66 . the first test against sri lanka in kanpur saw gavaskar 's 34th and final test century of 176 . he scored 74 and 5 in the next two tests as india won the three-match series 2–0 . the five-test series against arch enemies pakistan was to be his last . gavaskar scored 91 in the drawn first test in madras before withdrawing from the second test in calcutta as he had promised . in the fourth test in ahmedabad , gavaskar 's 63 made him the first batsman to pass 10,000 runs . with the teams locked 0–0 leading into the final test in bangalore , there was to be no fairytale . gavaskar was dismissed for 96 in the second innings as india were bowled out to give pakistan a 1–0 series win . . style . gavaskar was also a fine slip fielder and his safe catching in the slips helped him become the first indian ( excluding wicket-keepers ) to take over a hundred catches in test matches . in one odi against pakistan in sharjah in 1985 , he took four catches and helped india defend a small total of 125 . early in his test career , when india rarely used pace bowlers , gavaskar also opened the bowling for a short spell on occasions if only one pace bowler was playing , before a three-pronged spin attack took over . the only wicket claimed by him is that of pakistani zaheer abbas in 1978–79 . while gavaskar could not be described as an attacking batsman , he had the ability of keeping the scoreboard ticking with unique shots such as the '' late flick '' . his focus of technical correctness over flair meant that his style of play was usually less suited to the shorter form of the game , at which he had less success . his infamous 36 not out in the 1975 world cup , carrying his bat through the full 60 overs against england , led indian supporters to storm the field and confront him for scoring so slowly when india needed nearly a run a ball to win ; at the end of the game india had lost only three wickets but scored 200 runs less than england . gavaskar almost went through his career without scoring a one-day century . he managed his first ( and only odi century ) in the 1987 world cup , when he hit 103 not out in 88 balls against new zealand in his penultimate odi innings at vidarbha cricket association ground , nagpur . records and achievements . gavaskar was the first test cricket player to make over 10,000 runs . he held the record for the highest number of test centuries ( 34 ) before sachin
