and the artistic skill for making statues was lost in the process . renaissance . italian renaissance art identified the standing statue as the key form of roman art to survive , and there was a great revival of statues of both religious and secular figures , to which most of the leading figures contributed , led by donatello and michelangelo . the equestrian statue , a great technical challenge , was mastered again , and gradually statue groups . these trends intensified in baroque art , when every ruler wanted to have statues made of themself , and catholic churches filled with crowds of statues of saints , although after the protestant reformation religious sculpture largely disappeared from protestant churches , with some exceptions in large lutheran german churches . in england , churches instead were filled with increasing elaborate tomb monuments , for which the ultimate models were continental extravagances such as the papal tombs in rome , those of the doges of venice , or the french royal family . in the late 18th and 19th century there was a growth in public open air statues of public figures on plinths . as well as monarches , politicians , generals , landowners , and eventually artists and writers were commemorated . world war i saw the war memorial , previously uncommon , become very widespread , and these were often statues of generic soldiers . modern era . starting with the work of maillol around 1900 , the human figures embodied in statues began to move away from the various schools of realism that been followed for thousands of years . the futurist and cubist schools took this metamorphism even further until statues , often still nominally representing humans , had lost all but the most rudimentary relationship to the human form . by the 1920s and 1930s statues began to appear that were completely abstract in design and execution . giedion-welcker , carola , ‘ ’ contemporary sculpture : an evolution in volume and space , a revised and enlarged edition ’ ’ , faber and faber , london , 1961 pp . x to xx the notion that the position of the hooves of horses in equestrian statues indicated the rider 's cause of death has been disproved . . gallery . file : lion man photo.jpg löwenmensch figurine , from hohlenstein-stadel , germany , now in ulmer museum , ulm , germany , the oldest known zoomorphic statuette , aurignacian era , 40,000 bc-35,000 bc file : venus-of-schelklingen.jpg two views of the venus of hohle fels figurine , 40,000 bc-35,000 bc tall ) , one of the earliest known , undisputed examples of a depiction of a human being file : vestonicka venuse edit.jpg venus of dolní věstonice , ceramic figurine , 29,000 bc-25,000 bc file : venus von willendorf 01.jpg venus of willendorf , one of the oldest known statuettes , upper paleolithic , 24,000 bc-22,000 bc file:20100923 amman41.jpg 'ain ghazal statues , c . 7000 bc , at the amman citadel , jordan file : great sphinx of giza - 20080716a.jpg great sphinx of giza , c . 2558–2532 bc , the largest monolithic statue in the world , standing long , wide , and high . giza , egypt . file : aurigadelfi.jpg the charioteer of delphi , 474 bc , delphi archaeological museum , greece file : hermes di prassitele , at olimpia , front.jpg hermes and the infant dionysus by praxiteles , 4th century bc , archaeological museum of olympia , greece file : venus de milo louvre ma399 n4.jpg venus de milo , c . 130 - 100 bc , greek , the louvre file : laocoon pio-clementino inv1059-1064-1067.jpg laocoön and his sons , greek , ( late hellenistic ) , c . 160 bc and 20 bc , white marble , vatican museum file : naratodaijidaibutsu0212.jpg tōdai-ji , c . 752 , nara , japan file : the statue of gommateshvara bahubali dating 978-993 ad.jpg bahubali , c . 978-993 ad , 57 feet ( 17 & nbsp ;
