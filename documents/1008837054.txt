Jean Barraqué

life . barraqué was born in puteaux , hauts-de-seine . in 1931 , he moved with his family to paris . he studied in paris with jean langlais and olivier messiaen and , through messiaen , became interested in serialism . after completing his piano sonata in 1952 , he suppressed or destroyed his earlier works . a book published by the french music critic andré hodeir , titled since debussy , hodeir 1961 . created controversy around barraqué by claiming this work as perhaps the finest piano sonata since beethoven . as the work had still not been publicly performed , and only two other works by him had at this time , the extravagant claims made for barraqué in this book were received with some scepticism . whilst with hindsight it is clear that hodeir had accurately perceived the exceptional features of barraqué 's music—notably its searing romantic intensity , which distinguishes it from the contemporaneous works of boulez or stockhausen . as paul griffiths ' biography clarified , boulez had in fact attempted to get the barraqué piano sonata performed for some years after it was finished . griffiths 2003 , 45 . barraqué 's music was published starting in 1963 by the florentine businessman aldo bruzzichelli , griffiths 2001 . who provided much-needed material assistance for the composer , but whose promotion could not perhaps compete with that of the better known universal edition in vienna who published boulez , berio , and stockhausen . in any event , barraqué did not obtain ready access to the better-known new music festivals and concert series until much later than they . embracing the parisian avant-garde , barraqué entered into a romantic relationship with the philosopher michel foucault . together , they tried to produce their greatest work , used recreational drugs heavily and engaged in sado-masochistic sexual activity . ; ; . barraqué was involved in a car accident in 1964 , and his apartment was destroyed by fire in november 1968 . janzen 1989 , 241–42 . he suffered from bad health for much of his life . nevertheless , his death in paris in august 1973 , at the age of 45 , was sudden and unexpected , and he appeared to have resumed serious work on a number of larger compositions from the death of virgil cycle . page 1986 . . music and reputation . barraqué stated that he wrote about 30 works before those that he eventually acknowledged ; as far as is known they were destroyed by him . they included a nocturne and mouvement lent for piano , at least three piano sonatas , a sonata for unaccompanied violin , and a symphony in c sharp minor . henrich 1997 , 7-8 . the presumably fourth , but un-numbered piano sonata , for which he gave the date 1952 , was his earliest acknowledged work . barraqué then produced his only electronic piece , the musique concrète etude ( 1954 ) , made at pierre schaeffer 's studio . subsequently , he planned a large-scale cycle of pieces , la mort de virgile , based on hermann broch 's novel the death of virgil , a book which barraqué 's friend and sometime lover michel foucault recommended to him . this cycle , along with other pieces deriving from it or acting as commentaries upon it , he envisaged as his principal lifelong creative project . following the scheme of the novel , it was to be divided into four sub-cycles : 'water ( the arrival ) ' , 'fire ( the descent ) ' , 'earth ( the expectancy ) ' and 'air ( the return ) ' . most of barraqué 's creative efforts went into the works which were to take their place in 'fire ( the descent ) ' , which - to give an idea of the projected scope of the whole design - was to have consisted of thirteen works . halbreich 1987 , 7 . before his death he completed two of the projected parts : chant aprés chant ( 1966 ) , and le temps restitué ( 1957/68 ) . fragments of some of the other parts exist . barraqué also wrote . au delà du hasard ( 1958–59 ) for three female voices and ensemble , and a concerto for clarinet , vibraphone and ensemble in 1962–68 , which are related to the death of virgil , but not actually part of that cycle . ( . au delà du hasard is described as a commentary on affranchi du hasard , which was to have been the eleventh piece of 'fire ( the descent ) ' but was not actually composed . ) the only other extant piece by barraqué is séquence ( 1955–56 ) , a setting of nietzsche for soprano and ensemble which is partly a re-working of three songs for soprano and piano from the early fifties . the songs are published in henrich 1997 , abb . 21–23 . barraqué 's use of tone rows in his work is quite distinctive . rather than using a single tone row for an entire piece , as anton webern did , or using a number of related rows in one work , as alban berg or arnold schoenberg sometimes did , barraqué starts by using one row , and then subtly alters it to get a second . this second row is then used for a while before being slightly altered again to make a third . this process continues throughout the work . he called this technique '' proliferating series '' . riotte 1987 harry halbreich has written that '' barraqué 's whole work is marked by terrible despair , lightened by no religious or ideological faith , and entirely dominated by the great shadow of death '' . in 1998 the record company cpo issued his entire output on cd , in performances by the austrian ensemble klangforum wien . the major reference work on his music in english is a biography entitled the sea on fire by the british music critic paul griffiths ( 2003 ) . in german , heribert henrich 's book of 1997 is its complement . his music is now published by the german firm of bärenreiter . writings . barraqué wrote many articles on other composers ( including alban berg , monteverdi , mozart and messiaen ) and on theoretical aspects of contemporary music . his major prose work is his book on claude debussy ( paris : editions du seuil , 1962 ) . he also made numerous analyses of works in the standard repertoire from j.s . bach to honegger , some of which he used in his teaching . full list in henrich 1997 , 276–78 . his few pupils included the british composer bill hopkins . compositions . completed works . trois mélodies for soprano and piano ( 1950 ) ( texts from the song of solomon , baudelaire and rimbaud ) séquence for voice , percussion and chamber ensemble ( 1950–55 ) ( text by nietzsche ; incorporates material from the trois mélodies ) piano sonata ( 1950–52 ) etude for three-track tape ( 1952–53 ) le temps restitué for soprano , chorus and orchestra ( 1956–68 ) ( text from hermann broch , the death of virgil , in french translation by albert kohn ) . au delà du hasard ( premier commentaire de 'affranchi du hasard ' et du 'temps restitué ' ) for four instrumental groups and one vocal group ( 1958–59 ) ( text by barraqué 'around a quotation of hermann broch ' ) concerto for six instrumental groups and two solo instruments ( vibraphone and clarinet ) ( 1962–68 ) chant après chant for six percussionists , voice and piano ( 1966 ) ( text by barraqué and hermann broch ) . unfinished works . sonorité jaune ( 1957 sketch based on wassily kandinsky , der gelbe klang ) musique de scène for 4 clarinets ( bass clarinet ) , 3 saxophones ( alto , tenor , baritone ) , 2 trumpets , 2 trombones , tuba , percussion ( 3 players ) , xylophone , vibraphone , celesta , glockenspiel and piano . it also includes two reciters , '' l ’ aventurier '' ( the adventurer ) and '' le pauvre homme '' ( the poor man ) . 1958–59 . ua sirene operntheater 2017 . discours ( c . 1961 ) : sketch for a work for voices and orchestra , text from hermann broch , the death of virgil , in french translation by albert kohn ) lysanias ( c . 1966–69 ; 1972–73 ) : sketch for three solo voices and orchestra ( text by barraqué and hermann broch ) portiques du feu ( c . 1968 ; 1972–73 ) : sketch for 18 solo voices ( text by barraqué and hermann broch ) hymnes à plotia for string quartet ( 1972–73 ) . notes . sources . ozzard-low , patrick . 1989 . “ barraqué – broch – heidegger : a philosophical introduction to the music of jean barraqué ” . cahiers d ’ etudes germaniques no . 16:93–106 . page , tim . 1986 .
