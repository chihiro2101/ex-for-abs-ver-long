'' the haunting of hill house has become one of the most respected haunted house stories . '' the story prompted over 300 letters from readers , many of them outraged at its conjuring of a dark aspect of human nature , characterized by , as jackson put it , '' bewilderment , speculation , and old-fashioned abuse '' . in the july 22 , 1948 , issue of the san francisco chronicle , jackson offered the following in response to persistent queries from her readers about her intentions : '' explaining just what i had hoped the story to say is very difficult . i suppose i hoped , by setting a particularly brutal ancient rite in the present and in my own village , to shock the story 's readers with a graphic dramatization of the pointless violence and general inhumanity in their own lives . '' the critical reaction to the story was unequivocally positive ; the story quickly became a standard in anthologies and was adapted for television in 1952 .

lottery '' was published in a short story collection of jackson 's titled the lottery and other stories . jackson 's second novel , hangsaman ( 1951 ) , contained elements similar to the mysterious real-life december & nbsp ; 1 , 1946 , disappearance of an 18-year-old bennington college sophomore paula jean welden . this event , which remains unsolved to this day , took place in the wooded wilderness of glastenbury mountain near bennington in southern vermont , where jackson and her family were living at the time . the fictional college depicted in hangsaman is based in part on jackson 's experiences at bennington college , as indicated by jackson 's papers in the library of congress . the event also served as inspiration for her short story '' the missing girl '' ( first published in the magazine of fantasy and science fiction in 1957 , and posthumously in just an ordinary day ( 1995 ) ) . the following year , she published life among the savages , a semi-autobiographical collection of short stories based on her own life with her four children , many of which had been published prior in popular magazines such as good housekeeping , woman 's day and collier's . semi-fictionalized versions of her marriage and the experience of bringing up four children , these works are '' true-to-life funny-housewife stories '' of the type later popularized by such writers as jean kerr and erma bombeck during the 1950s and 1960s . reluctant to discuss her work with the public , jackson wrote in stanley j . kunitz and howard haycraft 's twentieth century authors ( 1955 ) : . the haunting of hill house and other works . in 1954 , jackson published the bird 's nest ( 1954 ) , which detailed a woman with multiple personalities and her relationship with her psychiatrist . one of jackson 's publishers , roger strauss , deemed the bird 's nest '' a perfect novel '' , but the publishing house marketed it as a psychological horror story , which displeased her . her following novel , the sundial , was published four years later and concerned a family of wealthy eccentrics who believe they have been chosen to survive the end of the world . she later published two memoirs , life among the savages and raising demons . jackson 's fifth novel , the haunting of hill house ( 1959 ) , follows a group of individuals participating in a paranormal study at a reportedly haunted mansion . the novel , which interpolated supernatural phenomena with psychology , went on to become a critically esteemed example of the haunted house story , and was described by stephen king as one of the most important horror novels of the twentieth century . also in 1959 , jackson published the one-act children 's musical the bad children , based on hansel and gretel . . declining health and death . by the time the haunting of hill house had been published , jackson suffered numerous health problems . she was a heavy smoker , which resulted in chronic asthma , joint pain , exhaustion , and dizziness leading to fainting spells , which were attributed to a heart problem . near the end of her life , jackson also saw a psychiatrist for severe anxiety , which had kept her housebound for extended periods of time , a problem worsened by a diagnosis of colitis , which made it physically difficult to travel even short distances from her home . to ease her anxiety and agoraphobia , the doctor prescribed barbiturates , which at that time were considered a safe , harmless drug . for many years , she also had periodic prescriptions for amphetamines for weight loss , which may have inadvertently aggravated her anxiety , leading to a cycle of prescription drug abuse using the two medications to counteract each other 's effects . any of these factors , or a combination of all of them , may have contributed to her declining health . jackson confided to friends that she felt patronized in her role as a '' faculty wife '' , and ostracized by the townspeople of north bennington . her dislike of this situation led to her increasing abuse of alcohol in addition to tranquilizers and amphetamines . despite her ailing health , jackson continued to write and publish several works in the 1960s , including her final novel , we have always lived in the castle ( 1962 ) , a gothic mystery novel . it was named by time magazine as one of the '' ten best novels '' of 1962 . the following year , she published nine magic wishes , an illustrated children 's novel about a child who encounters a magician who grants him numerous enchanting wishes . the psychological aspects of her illness responded well to therapy , and by 1964 she began to resume normal activities , including a round of speaking engagements at writers ' conferences , as well as planning a new novel titled come along with me , which was to be a major departure from the style and subject matter of her previous works . in 1965 , jackson died in her sleep at her home in north bennington , at the age of 48 . her death was attributed to a coronary occlusion due to arteriosclerosis or cardiac arrest . she was cremated , as was her wish . posthumous publications . in 1968 , jackson 's husband released a posthumous volume of her work , come along with me , containing her unfinished last novel , as well as 14 previously uncollected short stories ( among them '' louisa ,
