Microstate

definitions . most scholars identify microstates by using a quantitative threshold and applying it to either one variable ( such as the size of its territory mehmet , o . & tahiroglu , m . , 2002 . growth and equity in microstates : does size matter in development ? international journal of social economics , 29 ( 1/2 ) , pp.152–162 . or population boyce , p.j . & herr , r.a . , 2008 . microstate diplomacy in the south pacific . australian outlook , ( april 2012 ) , pp.37–41 . ) or a composite of different variables . reid , g.l . , 1975 . impact of very small size on the international behaviour of microstates ( international studies ) , sage publications ltd . while it is agreed that microstates are the smallest of all states , there is no consensus on what variable ( or variables ) or what cut-off point should be used to determine which political units should be labelled as '' microstates '' ( as opposed to small '' normal '' states ) . neemia , u . , 1995 . smallness , islandness and foreign policy behaviour : aspects of island microstates foreign policy behaviour with special reference to cook islands and kiribati . university of wollongong . dommen , e . , 1985 . states , microstates and islands , routledge kegan & paul . while employing simple quantitative criteria may seem straightforward , it can also be perceived as potentially problematic . according to some scholars the quantitative approach to defining microstates suffers from such problems as '' inconsistency , arbitrariness , vagueness and inability to meaningfully isolate qualitatively distinct political units '' . . list of microstates — by area or population . : - . other definitions . some academics have suggested defining microstates according to the unique features that are linked to their geographic or demographic smallness . neumann , i.b . & gstöhl , s . , 2004 . lilliputians in gulliver ’ s world ? small states in international relations . newer approaches have proposed looking at the behaviour or capacity to operate in the international arena in order to determine which states should deserve the microstate label . oest , k.j.n . & wivel , a . , 2010 . security , profit or shadow of the past ? explaining the security strategies of microstates . cambridge review of international affairs , 23 ( 3 ) , pp . 429–453 . yet , it has been argued that such approaches could lead to either confusing microstates with weak states ( or failed states ) or relying too much on subjective perceptions . an alternative approach , that may overcome these challenges , is to define microstates as '' modern protected states '' . according to the definition proposed by dumienski ( 2014 ) : '' microstates are modern protected states , i.e . sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints . '' adopting this approach permits limiting the number of microstates and separating them from both small states and autonomies or dependencies . examples of microstates understood as modern protected states include such states as liechtenstein , san marino , monaco , niue , andorra , the cook islands or palau . the smallest political unit recognized as a sovereign state is vatican city . however , professor of international law maurice mendelson disputes qualifying vatican city as a state , arguing that it does not meet the '' traditional criteria of statehood '' and that the '' special status of the vatican city is probably best regarded as a means of ensuring that the pope can freely exercise his spiritual functions , and in this respect is loosely analogous to that of the headquarters of international organisations .

'' is small really beautiful ? the microstate mistake '' , journal of democracy , 25 ( 3 ) : 135-148 . due to small populations , family and personal relations are often decisive in microstate politics . in some cases , this impedes neutral and formal decision-making and instead leads to undemocratic political activity , such as clientelism , corruption , particularism and executive dominance . while microstates often have formal institutions that are associated with democracy , the inner workings of politics in microstates are in reality often undemocratic . the high number of democracies amongst microstates could be explained by their colonial history . most microstates adopted the same political system as their colonial ruler . anckar , d . ( 2008 ) . '' microstate democracy : majority or consensus ; diffusion or problem-solving ? '' , democratization , 15 ( 1 ) : 67-85 . because of the high number of microstates that were british colonies in the past , microstates often have a majoritarian and parliamentary political system similar to the westminster system . some microstates with a history as british colony have implemented some aspects of a consensus political system , to adapt to their geographic features or societal make-up . while the colonial history often determines what political systems microstates have , they do implement changes to better accommodate their specific characteristics . microstates and international relations . microstates often rely on other countries in order to survive , as they have a small military capacity and a lack of resources . this had led some researchers to believe that microstates are forced to subordinate themselves to larger states which reduces their sovereignty . sharman , j.c . ( 2017 ) . '' sovereignty at the extremes : micro-states in world politics '' , political studies , 65 ( 3 ) : 559-575 . research , however , has shown that microstates strategically engage in clientelism with other countries . veenendaal , w .
