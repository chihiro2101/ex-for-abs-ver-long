'' he discovers that he is able to lift the door off its hinges and escape . the university wizards become trapped when mrs whitlow , the head maid , closes the window that leads back into the professor 's study . the wizards soon encounter plants that rapidly evolve to suit their needs but , apart from ponder , do not question the turn of events until a large dinosaur evolves into a chicken in front of their eyes . after finding a plant-based boat , the wizards start to question their surroundings even more and the god of evolution , who has been causing the events , then turns up and helps explain things . the god does n't understand the purpose of the seeds and is , it turns out , unaware of the concept of sexual reproduction . after mrs whitlow explains it to him , the excited god decides to redesign the creatures on the island in order to incorporate the idea . ( the god is also shown to have created a large number of beetle species , in reference to the quotation by j . b . s . haldane . ) the wizards then reach fourecks , inventing surfing along the way , and meet the creator of fourecks ( not of the disc ) in the process of creating it by way of indigenous australian art . the wizards bicker over the creator 's technique and inadvertently create the duck-billed platypus . the librarian meanwhile steals the creator 's bullroarer and spins it , causing the drought rincewind is in the process of stopping . the wizards are then frozen in time for thousands of years by the stray magic left over from creating the continent . rincewind , having escaped from gaol , meets up with a group of female impersonators , darleen and letitia , and a female , neilette . the '' ladies '' have found his luggage , which rescues him from the watch . in the escape , rincewind and neilette break into the old brewery ( which was never used because all the beer kept going flat ) . an earthquake ( induced by the voice of the creator ) causes the brewery to collapse , trapping them inside the luggage . when they emerge , rincewind can see the ethereal outlines of the wizards ( who were trapped , frozen in time , for 30,000 years in the brewery ) . eventually he arrives at the university of fourecks ( which has a tower that is taller on the inside than it is on the outside ) . rincewind figures out how to free the wizards . the wizards attempt to find a way to bring back the rain , but are unsuccessful . as they are sitting around , rincewind idly twirls the bullroarer , which soon begins to fly faster and farther than it should . rincewind lets go and the bullroarer flies off ; immediately , it begins to rain . having saved fourecks , rincewind and the wizards return to ankh-morpork by ship , and the story ends with the old man with the sack ( the creator of the last continent ) catching the bullroarer in front of a young boy . reception . the sf site described it as '' ( l ) oads of sarcasm , an outrageous plot and tons of sheer fun '' . the last continent , reviewed by todd richmond , at the sf site ; published 1999 infinity plus was less positive , recommending that discworld newcomers start elsewhere , and stating that it '' falls below ( pratchett 's ) normal very high standard on several counts '' , because although it is '' great fun '' and '' worth buying '' , it '' does n't hang together as a plot , as an unfolding story '' . the last continent by terry pratchett ( doubleday , Â£16.99 , 261 pages , hardback . published 1998 . ) , reviewed by john owen , at infinity plus ; june 20 , 1998 ; retrieved october 15 , 2017 . see also .
