Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre

biography . after a childhood fever , he suffered from very sensitive eyes , and believed that he would soon go blind . for fear of losing his ability to read , he devoured any book available and trained his memory . he thus immersed himself in greek and latin literature , acquired the ability to recall entire pages verbatim weeks after reading them , became fluent in italian , english and german and even wrote an unpublished règle ou méthode facile pour apprendre la langue anglaise ( easy rule or method for learning english ) . delambre 's quickly achieved success in his career in astronomy , such that in 1788 , he was elected a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences . in 1790 , to establish a universally accepted foundation for the definition of measures , the national constituent assembly asked the french academy of sciences to introduce a new unit of measurement . the academics decided on the metre , defined as 1 / 10,000,000 of the distance from the north pole to the equator , and prepared to organise an expedition to measure the length of the meridian arc between dunkirk and barcelona . this portion of the meridian , which also passes through paris , was to serve as the basis for the length of the quarter meridian , connecting the north pole with the equator . in april 1791 , the academy 's metric commission confided this mission to jean-dominique de cassini , adrien-marie legendre and pierre méchain . cassini was chosen to head the northern expedition but , as a royalist , he refused to serve under the revolutionary government after the arrest of louis xvi on his flight to varennes . on 15 february 1792 , delambre was elected unanimously a member of the french academy of sciences and in may 1792 , after cassini 's final refusal , was placed in charge of the northern expedition , measuring the meridian from dunkirk to rodez in the south of france . pierre méchain headed the southern expedition , measuring from barcelona to rodez . the measurements were finished in 1798 . the gathered data were presented to an international conference of savants in paris the following year . in 1801 , first consul napoléon bonaparte took the presidency of the french academy of sciences and appointed delambre its permanent secretary for the mathematical sciences , a post he held until his death . after méchain 's death in 1804 , he was appointed director of the paris observatory . he was also professor of astronomy at the collège de france . the same year he married elisabeth-aglaée leblanc de pommard , a widow with whom he had lived already for a long time . her son , achille-césar-charles de pommard ( 1781–1807 ) assisted delambre on several occasions in his astronomical and geodetical surveys , notably the measuring of the baselines for the meridian survey , and the latitude definition for paris in december 1799 which was presented to the conference of savants . delambre was one of the first astronomers to derive astronomical equations from analytical formulas , was the author of delambre 's analogies and , after the age of 70 , also the author of works on the history of astronomy like the histoire de l'astronomie . he was a knight ( chevalier ) of the order of saint michael and of the légion d'honneur . his name is also one of the the 72 names on the eiffel tower . he was elected a foreign honorary member of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1822 . delambre died in 1822 and was interred in père lachaise cemetery in paris . the crater delambre on the moon is named after him . delambre was an atheist . george william foote , ed .
