early life and military career . tanaka was born as the third son of a low-ranking samurai family in the service of chōshū domain in hagi , nagato province ( modern day yamaguchi prefecture ) , japan . at the age of 13 , he participated in the hagi rebellion . he had an interest in politics from an early age , serving on a village council and as an elementary school teacher . he only joined the imperial japanese army at the age of 20 . he graduated from the former 8th class of imperial japanese army academy and the 8th class of the army war college in 1892 , and served as a junior officer during the first sino-japanese war . after the end of the war , he was sent as a military attaché to moscow and petrograd , and was in russia at the same time as takeo hirose of the imperial japanese navy , with whom he became close friends . tanaka was fluent in the russian language , which he learned while attending mass every sunday at a russian orthodox church , which enabled him to practice his russian at church social events , although it is uncertain if he ever actually converted to christianity . as one of the few russian experts within the military , he was an invaluable resource to army planners during the russo-japanese war , and served as aide to general kodama gentarō in manchuria . in 1906 , tanaka helped draft a defense plan which was so highly regarded by the imperial japanese army general staff and general yamagata aritomo that it was adopted as basic policy until world war i . he was also awarded the order of the golden kite ( 3rd class ) in april 1906 . in 1910 , he established a veterans association . tanaka was promoted to major general in 1911 , and was made director of the military affairs bureau at the ministry of the army , where he recommended an increase in the strength of the standing army by two additional infantry divisions . he was awarded the order of the sacred treasure ( 1st class ) in september 1918 . he joined the cabinet of prime ministers hara takashi as army minister from september 1918 to june 1921 . he was promoted to full general in 1920 and was awarded the order of the rising sun ( 1st class ) . he was also elevated to the title of danshaku ( baron ) under the kazoku peerage system . however , the hara cabinet came under unceasing criticism due to the nishihara loans , the disastrous nikolayevsk incident and accusations of army misappropriation of secret funds , and supporting unsavory figures such as white movement general roman von ungern-sternberg . after suffering from an attack of angina , tanaka resigned all posts , and retired to his summer home in oiso , kanagawa . politician and prime minister . tanaka returned as army minister in the 2nd yamamoto administration from september 1923 to january 1924 . after retiring from the army , tanaka was invited to accept the post of party president of the rikken seiyūkai political party in 1925 , and was made a member of the house of peers from january 1926 . he had been scheduled to be promoted to the rank of field marshal at the time of his retirement . however , when news reached the ears of the army ministry of a 3 million yen bonus that tanaka received on agreeing to join the rikken seiyukai , the promotion was denied . tanaka became prime minister of japan on 20 april 1927 , during the shōwa financial crisis , serving simultaneously as the foreign affairs minister . he later added the posts of home minister ( 4 may 1928 to 23 may 1928 ) , and colonial affairs minister ( 10 june 1929 to 2 july 1929 ) to his portfolio . on the domestic front , tanaka attempted to suppress leftists , communists and suspected communist sympathizers through widespread arrests ( the 15 march incident of 1928 , and the 19 april incident of 1929 ) . on foreign policy , tanaka differed from his predecessor shidehara both tactically and strategically . whereas shidehara preferred to evacuate japanese residents where conflicts occurred with local people , tanaka preferred using military force . while shidehara theoretically respected china 's sovereignty , tanaka openly pursued a to manchuria-mongolia problem between those areas and the rest of china . on three separate occasions in 1927 and 1928 he sent troops to intervene militarily in shandong province to block chiang kai-shek 's northern expedition to unify china under kuomintang rule , in what became known as the jinan incident . tanaka came into office even as forces were already beginning to converge that would draw japan into world war ii . in 1928 , however , the machinations of the ultranationalist secret societies and the kwantung army resulted in a crisis : the assassination of the manchurian warlord zhang zuolin and the failed attempt to seize manchuria . tanaka himself was taken by surprise by the assassination plot and argued that the officers responsible should be publicly court-martialed for homicide . the military establishment , from which tanaka was by now estranged , insisted on covering up the facts of the incident , which remained an official secret . bereft of support , and under mounting criticism in the diet and even from emperor hirohito himself , tanaka and his cabinet resigned en masse on 2 july 1929 . tanaka was succeeded by hamaguchi osachi , and died a few months after his resignation . he was awarded the order of the paulownia flowers on his death . his grave is at the tama cemetery in fuchū , tokyo . tama cemetery . the tanaka memorial . in 1929 , china accused tanaka of having authored the '' tanaka memorial imperialist conquest plan '' , which advocated the conquest of manchuria , mongolia , and eventually the whole of china . he was alleged to have presented the plan to the emperor in 1927 . the plan was presented as fact in the wartime propaganda film series why we fight , which claimed that the plan envisaged the conquest of america after east asia . dower , john w ( 1987 ) . war without mercy :
