Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg

history . in 1443 the last member of the senior branch of the house of luxemburg , duchess elisabeth , sold the duchy of luxembourg to duke philip the good of burgundy , a prince of the french house of valois . in 1477 the duchy passed by marriage of philip 's granddaughter , mary of burgundy , to archduke maximilian i of austria of the house of habsburg . luxembourg was one of the fiefdoms in the former burgundian netherlands which maximilian and mary 's grandson , emperor charles v , combined into an integral union , the seventeen provinces , by issuing the pragmatic sanction of 1549 . the southern netherlands remained part of the habsburg empire , first held by the spanish branch and then by the austrian line , until 1794 when french revolution replaced habsburg rule with french hegemony until the defeat of napoleon . luxembourg 's territories , centering on the ancestral castle , were taken from occupying france forces in the first stages of the fall of napoleon . some were eventually ceded to william i of the netherlands , who had been declared sovereign prince of the netherlands in 1813 , by his cousin king frederick william iii of prussia who annexed other territories which had been held by princes of the various branches of the house of nassau . the great powers agreed at the congress of vienna in 1815 to re-constitute and elevate luxembourg into a grand duchy , to be hereditary in the male line of the entire house of nassau , beginning with the prince of orange , who was simultaneously but separately recognised as king of the netherlands . thus william i of the netherlands ascended the grand ducal throne as the first grand duke of luxemburg . when the male line of the house of orange-nassau became extinct in 1890 , the crown of the netherlands went to his descendant , wilhelmina of orange-nassau , but the crown of luxembourg continued in the male line , devolving upon the head of the only surviving branch of the house of nassau , ex-duke adolf of nassau-weilburg . his son , guillaume iv ( reigned 1905–1912 ) , left no sons and was succeeded by his daughters , marie-adélaïde and then by charlotte ( reigned 1919–1964 ) . her descendants ( from her marriage to prince felix of bourbon-parma ) comprise the grand ducal house in the 21st century . titulature . the monarch bears the style of royal highness ( subsumed in the higher style of majesty that was borne by its sovereigns during the personal union of the grand duchy with the kingdom of the netherlands until 1890 ) , to which the heir apparent is also entitled . de badts de cugnac , chantal . coutant de saisseval , guy . le petit gotha . nouvelle imprimerie laballery , paris 2002 , pp . 572-573 , 582 , 665-668 , 678 , 684 ( french ) the other male-line descendants of grand duke adolphe held the titles '' prince/princess of luxembourg '' and '' prince/princess of nassau '' , with the style of grand ducal highness . until 1995 , the daughters and male-line issue of grand duchess charlotte also bore the title of '' prince/princess of bourbon-parma '' and were addressed as royal highness , in right of their descent from her consort , prince felix of bourbon-parma . on 28 july 1987 , by grand ducal decree , members of the dynasty assumed the surname '' de nassau '' and discontinued use of the princely title and inescutcheon of the house of bourbon-parma ( the dukes of which had not consented to the marriages to commoners of the dynasts of their luxembourg cadet branch , prince charles in 1967 and hereditary grand duke henri in 1981 ) , while retaining the style of royal highness . since the grand ducal decree of 21 september 1995 , dynasts who are the children of a grand duke or hereditary grand duke hold the titles '' prince/princess of luxembourg '' and '' prince/princess of nassau '' with the style of royal highness . shortly after his accession to the throne in october 2000 , grand duke henri issued a grand ducal decree conferring upon his eldest son and heir , prince guillaume , the title of '' hereditary grand duke '' and restoring to him the title '' prince of bourbon-parma '' . male line descendants of grand duchess charlotte who are not the children of a grand duke or hereditary grand duke are '' prince/princess of nassau '' with the style of his/her royal highness . a grand ducal decree in 2012 , concerning the family pact , further defined the rules of titles borne . grand-ducal decree of 18 june 2012 on the coordination of the family statute of 5 may 1907 .
