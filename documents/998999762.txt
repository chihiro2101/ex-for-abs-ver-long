Ariane 3

development . in 1973 , eleven nations decided to pursue joint collaboration in the field of space exploration and formed a new pan-national organisation to undertake this mission , the european space agency ( esa ) . harvey 2003 , pp . 161-162 . six years later , in december 1979 , the arrival of a capable european expendable launch system was marked when the first ariane 1 launcher was successfully launched from the guiana space centre at kourou , french guiana . harvey 2003 , p . 169 . the ariane 1 soon became considered to be a capable and competitive launcher in comparison to rival platforms offered by the soviet union and the united states . however , even prior to the launcher having entering service , there was a strong desire to quickly produce improved derivatives that would be able to handle even greater payloads than ariane 1 could . these desires would result in the creation of both the ariane 2 and ariane 3 . harvey 2003 , pp . 172-174 . while the initiative was first proposed in 1978 , prior to the ariane 1 's first flight , approval to commence the first phase of development was not received until july 1979 . harvey 2003 , p . 174 . the bulk of development work on the new launcher occurred between 1980 and 1982 . the ariane 3 was designed to satisfy the future demand for the delivery of two tonne payloads into a geosynchronous transfer orbit ( gto ) . according to aerospace historian brian harvey , in spite of the numbering sequence adopted , the ariane 3 was the direct successor to the ariane 1 , rather than the ariane 2 , as could be logically assumed . harvey 2003 , p . 174 . the principal agency behind the development of the ariane 3 was the centre national d'etudes spatiales ( cnes ) , while the lead company for its production was the french aerospace manufacturer aérospatiale . harvey 2003 , p . 214 . in order to keep costs down , cnes directed that only tested technologies could be implemented in the launcher 's improvements ; in fact , no budget was provided for new test series to be performed . furthermore , it was restricted to using the existing launch pad and handling facilities established for the ariane 1 , and that there was to be no allowance for retooling of the ariane production line . however , one new piece of infrastructure that was permitted was the establishment of tracking equipment in the ivory coast ; the existing infrastructure based in brazil used by the ariane 1 was less suitable due to the increased performance of the ariane 3 , which flew a different ascent profile that reached 250km , rather than 200km before coasting into orbit . harvey 2003 , p . 215 . performance boosts were achieved via several different ways , such as the elongated third stage fuel tanks to carry 30 percent more fuel , elevated combustion pressure in multiple stages , a new intertank structure that supported the addition of solid-fuel boosters , and the adoption of a new fuel mixture . harvey 2003 , pp . 214-215 . the finalised ariane 3 followed the same basic design as the earlier ariane 1 , but incorporated numerous modifications that had been made for the ariane 2 . unlike the ariane 2 , two solid-fuelled pap strap-on booster rockets were used to augment the first stage at liftoff . harvey 2003 , pp . 216-217 . the core of the ariane 3 was essentially identical to that of the ariane 2 . the first stage was powered by four viking 2b bipropellant engines , burning uh 25 ( 25 % straight hydrazine , 75 % udmh ) in a dinitrogen tetroxide oxidiser . the second stage was powered by a viking 4b , which used the same fuel-oxidiser combination . the third stage used a cryogenic fuel hm7b engine , burning liquid hydrogen in liquid oxygen . on some flights , a mage 2 kick motor was flown as a fourth stage . one atypical modification for the era was the revised satellite deployment system , which could facilitate the launch of two smaller satellites as well as one larger one . the ariane 3 's design heavily influenced that of its successor , the ariane 4 ; while the design team considered various approaches for achieving such a launcher , one of the studied concepts had involved the addition of a fifth engine to an enlarged first stage of the ariane 3 . harvey 2003 , p . 179 . however , this was determined to have involved a very high level of redesign work ; an alternative approach was instead adopted , in which the first stage was elongated to hold 210 tonnes of propellant instead of the 145 tonnes present on the ariane 3 . while the second and third stages of the ariane 4 remained identical to the ariane 3 , a range of strap-on boosters were developed to be applied to the type , designed to gradually increase the rocket 's payload capacity . overall , the ariane 4 was 15 per cent smaller than the ariane 3 . harvey 2003 , p . 180 . it was effectively an improved and developed derivative of the earlier ariane 3 , primarily differing through the application of various solid-fuelled and liquid-fuelled boosters , the latter being the only all-new design feature of the ariane 4 . . launch history . the ariane 3 made its maiden flight on 4 august 1984 , almost two years before the ariane 2 's first launch , placing the ecs-2 and télécom 1a satellites into geosynchronous transfer orbit . harvey 2003 , pp . 176 . the esa opted for a calculated risk on the first launch , saving €60 million , by performing a commercial launch with the very first flight of the ariane 3 . this was perhaps even more daring as not only was this flight using a new launcher but also the new capability to launch two satellites at once . the gamble paid off , as the launch was a complete success . at the time of the ariane 3 's maiden flight , the united states still held a majority of the global launcher market ; by the end of the year , the order books were shifting in favour of the ariane family , having outstanding orders to launch 30 satellites at a cumulative cost of €1 billion . eleven ariane 3 launchers were launched with ten successes and one failure . the failure occurred on the fifth flight , launched on 12 september 1985 , when the third stage failed to ignite resulting in the rocket failing to achieve orbit . the ecs-3 and spacenet-3 satellites were lost in the failure . despite this sole loss , the reliability of the ariane family meant that insurance costs for the launcher were actually less than that of rival american launchers . throughout the 1980s , the platform became increasingly competitive on the global stage . harvey 2003 , pp . 176 . according to harvey , the ariane family had become the dominant series of launchers on the world market as early as 1986 . harvey 2003 , p . 172 . despite its relative success , the ariane 3 was quickly replaced by the even more capable ariane 4 , resulting in the launcher only conducting a comparatively small number of launches . the ariane 3 conducted its final flight on 12 july 1989 , carrying the olympus f1 satellite .
