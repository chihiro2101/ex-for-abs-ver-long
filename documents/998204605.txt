rise to fame , 1984–1989 . with raymonde , the band released a series of critically acclaimed albums and eps that explored their new style . these included the spangle maker ( 1984 ) , treasure ( 1984 ) , aikea-guinea ( 1985 ) , tiny dynamine ( 1985 ) , echoes in a shallow bay ( 1985 ) , and love 's easy tears ( 1986 ) . raymonde , who was called in to work on the second album by this mortal coil , did not participate in the recording of the fourth cocteau twins lp , victorialand ( 1986 ) , a predominantly acoustic record which featured only guthrie and fraser . raymonde returned to the group for the moon and the melodies ( 1986 ) , a collaboration with ambient composer harold budd , which was not released under the cocteau twins name . in 1985 4ad signed an agreement with relativity records for distribution of cocteau twins releases in the us and other territories . to commemorate the event , the compilation the pink opaque ( 1985 ) was released as a way of introducing the new , broader audience to the band 's back catalogue . while remaining a 4ad band internationally , cocteau twins finally signed a major-label contract with capitol records in 1988 for distribution in the united states , and released their fifth album , blue bell knoll , in september of that year .

vegas in late 1990 . the most commercially successful of their many recordings , the album rose to the higher reaches of the uk albums chart immediately after its release . despite the success of the record and the subsequent concert tours , not everything was well with the band . they parted ways with 4ad following heaven or las vegas partly because of conflicts with the label 's founder ivo watts-russell , and were close to breaking up over internal problems due in large part to guthrie 's substance abuse . while on their international tour supporting heaven or las vegas , the group signed a new recording contract with mercury records subsidiary fontana for the uk and elsewhere , while retaining their us relationship with capitol . in 1991 , 4ad and capitol released a box set that compiled the band 's eps from 1982 to 1990 , and also included a bonus disc of rare and previously unreleased material . fraser and guthrie ended their 13-year relationship in 1993 , and by this time had a young daughter , lucy-belle , born in 1989 . the band 's seventh lp , four-calendar café , their first since fraser and guthrie 's separation , was released in late 1993 . the band explained that four-calendar café was a response to the turmoil that had engulfed them in the intervening years , with guthrie entering rehab and quitting alcohol and drugs , and fraser undergoing psychotherapy . later releases and break-up , 1995–1997 . 1995 saw the release of two new eps : twinlights and otherness . some of the tracks on twinlights and otherness were versions of songs from

were taken from the album : '' tishbite '' and '' violaine '' ; both exist in two cd versions , with different b-sides included on each . the band , augmented by an extra guitarist and a drummer , toured extensively to support the album , their last for mercury/fontana . a new song , '' touch upon touch '' , which debuted during the live shows and was recorded later in 1996 was also one of the two songs written and arranged by fraser , guthrie and raymonde for chinese pop singer faye wong for her mandarin album fuzao released in june 1996 , the other being '' tranquil eye '' from violaine released in october 1996 . in 1997 , while recording what was to have been their ninth lp , the trio disbanded over irreconcilable differences in part related to the breakup of guthrie and fraser . while a number of songs were partially recorded and possibly completed , the band has stated that they will likely never be finished or released in any form . post-breakup . in 1999 bella union , the record label founded by guthrie and raymonde , released a double-cd cocteau twins compilation entitled bbc sessions . the collection is a complete record of the band 's appearances on uk radio

would have paid him £1.5 million . later in 2005 , 4ad released a worldwide limited edition of 10,000 compilation box set titled lullabies to violaine , a 4-disc set that details every single and ep
