UN/CEFACT

trade facilitation and electronic business . un/cefact focusses on two main areas of activity to make international trade processes more efficient and streamlined , namely : trade facilitation and electronic business . trade facilitation involves the simplification of trade procedures ( or the elimination of unnecessary procedures ) . this includes work to standardize and harmonize the core information used in trade documents , to ease the flow of information between parties by relying on appropriate information and communication technology , and to promote simplified payment systems to foster transparency , accountability and cost-effectiveness . electronic business , in the un/cefact context , focuses on harmonizing , standardizing and automating the exchange of information that controls the flow of goods along the international supply chain . un/cefact 's work on electronic business is driven by the understanding that goods can not move faster than the processes and information that accompany them . un/cefact takes a total trade transaction approach to trade facilitation and associated electronic business , covering all the processes from initial placement of orders through to final payments . this is best illustrated through the un/cefact buy-ship-pay model of the international supply chain , which forms the basis of its work . deliverables . un/cefact has produced over 30 trade facilitation recommendations and a range of electronic business standards ( collectively referred to as “ instruments ” ) which are used throughout the world by both governments and the private sector . they reflect best practices in trade procedures and data and documentary requirements . the international organization for standardization ( iso ) has adopted many of them as international standards . un/cefact recommendations and standards are implemented throughout the world . some of the more well known instruments are : recommendation 1 : united nations layout key ( unlk ) for trade documents . this provides an international basis for the standardized layout of documents used in international trade . the layout key facilitates the exchange of information between the various parties involved in a commercial transaction and is used as the basis for many key trade documents such as the european union 's single administrative document ( sad ) ; fiata 's freight forwarding instruction ; unece 's dangerous goods declaration ; and the world customs organization goods declaration for export . use of the un layout key is specifically recommended in the wco 's revised kyoto convention . it is important to note that the layout key is so widely used in international trade that many expect normal trade documents to conform to the recommendation . recommendation 16 : un/locode code for trade and transport locations provides an alphabetic code for seaports , airports , inland freight terminals and other customs clearance sites . recommended by the international maritime organization ( imo ) , it is used by most major shipping companies and also by the universal postal union ( upu ) . un/locode 's website is regularly visited , accounting for 6 % of all “ hits ” to the unece website . the first issue of un/locode in 1981 provided codes to represent the names of some 8000 locations in the world . today , un/locode , which is updated twice annually , contains almost 100 000 entries with strong demand for further updates and extension . every recognised national and international airport or maritime port will have a un/locode coding . recommendation 25 and the un/edifact standard represent a set of internationally agreed standards , directories , and guidelines for the electronic interchange of structured data , between independent computerized information systems . un/edifact is the international standard for electronic data interchange and is used throughout the commercial and administrative world . un/edifact accounts for over 90 % of all electronic data interchange ( edi ) messages exchanged globally . un/edifact messages are used by almost all national customs administrations , all major seaports and a large range of companies ( including over 100 000 in the retail sector ) , and throughout international supply chains . for example , more than 7 million edifact messages are exchanged each year in the french agricultural supply chain . recommendation 33 on single windows proposes that governments establish a single window facility that allows parties involved in trade and transport to lodge standardized information and documents with a single entry point to fulfil all import , export and transit-related regulatory requirements . a suite of complementary single window recommendations has also been developed , namely recommendation 34 on data simplification and standardization and 35 on establishing a legal framework for single windows . a family of supply chain “ cross-industry ” messages are exchanged globally between trading partners covering the majority of business-to-business ( b2b ) electronic exchanges from order to payment . one of the key documents within this family is the cross industry invoice ( cii ) which functions primarily as a request for payment , used as a key document for value added tax ( vat ) declaration and reclamation , for statistics declarations and to support export and import declarations in international trade . the edaplos message describes the data crop sheet exchanged between farmers and their partners . this message has allowed users to harmonize the definitions of technical data , develop consensual data dictionaries which can be used as a basis for all the steps of traceability and create a standardized crop data sheet message . daplos , which is based on the un/cefact core component library , has been adopted by 25 000 farmers and regional agriculture chambers in france and belgium . cites ( the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora ) has developed a version of their declaration using the core component library of un/cefact and has generated an xml message according to the specifications of un/cefact . cites is an international agreement between governments . its aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival . the cites declarations are used in customs clearance procedures in all countries around the globe . benefits . governments , traders and consumers all benefit from having simpler and more cost-effective trade procedures . un/cefact 's work is particularly relevant for developing countries , where the elimination of trade-related inefficiencies is many times more beneficial than the reduction or removal of tariff barriers to trade . in addition , un/cefact 's work is of particular benefit to landlocked countries and countries distant from major markets . these countries experience challenges and constraints resulting from complex and inefficient procedures , including the creation of many additional costs in bringing goods to market . the gains from this work are considerable for small and medium-sized enterprises , for which the costs of compliance with various trade-related procedures are proportionally higher . this is particularly true in the case of low-value shipments , where the cost of administrative procedures represents a large proportion of total cost . structure . in view of the global character of its work on trade facilitation and electronic business standards , un/cefact is open to representatives of all un member states and all organisations recognized by the united nations economic and social council ( ecosoc ) . the participation of developing countries and countries in transition in standards development processes is strongly encouraged . the highest authority regarding all aspects of un/cefact 's work is the intergovernmental plenary which meets once a year in geneva . delegations to the plenary include un member states , intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations ( ngo 's ) recognized by the economic and social council of the united nations ( ecosoc ) . only un member states have the right to vote at plenary meetings – all other members are observers . the plenary elects the un/cefact bureau which consists of a chair and at least four vice-chairs . the bureau acts in the name of the plenary between sessions and meets physically an average of four times per year and more frequently through virtual conference calls . each un member states may nominate a permanent head of delegation ( hod ) to un/cefact . hods participate in the plenary , are consulted by the bureau on key strategic issues , and are responsible for nominating experts to participate in un/cefact activities . the technical work to develop un/cefact standards and recommendations is done by over 200 volunteer experts from around the world , nominated by hods . the experts come from both the public and the private sectors , forming a public-private partnership in support of trade facilitation and electronic business . they participate as independent volunteer experts in their own right , without representing any special interests of their countries or institutions . the experts are representatives from : governments private companies intergovernmental organizations industry associations ( representing large collective groups of private-sector companies ) academia un/cefact experts meet physically in un/cefact forums , which are held twice a year ( one in geneva and one hosted by a un member state ) in order to coordinate their work . the vast majority of the work is done virtually between forums . unece provides secretarial support to un/cefact in order that the centre may implement its programme of work . annually , the un/cefact bureau ( acting on behalf of the plenary ) and the unece secretariat plan for the implementation of un/cefact 's programme of work , taking into account the resources available from both the united nations and externally . the secretariat takes responsibility for supporting the work of un/cefact including supporting the maintenance of recommendations and standards ; and handles the administrative functions related to un/cefact , including un oversight , organizing meetings and preparing official documents and papers . the technical work of standards development is undertaken by the un/cefact experts .
