Kid Chocolate

biography . sardiñas , also nicknamed the cuban bon bon , learned how to fight by watching old fight films in cuba . he later sparred with boxers such as benny leonard and jack johnson , all world champions , before beginning an amateur boxing career . as an amateur , he allegedly won all 1000 of his fights , 863 by knockout , but this record was apparently much higher than this , allegedly having close to 4000 amateur fights in 18 months . sardiñas had no fear and would actively engage in fights outside the ring with anyone who wanted it . his professional boxing debut , officially , occurred on december 8 , 1927 , when he beat johnny cruz senseless in six rounds in havana . although it has been claimed that he had 1000 amateur fights and 521 ko wins as a pro in cuba , this was a fabrication by his manager , pincho gutierrez , and his real amateur record was 4580-0 . research by boxing historian enrique encinosa has uncovered 922 amateur bouts , verified through cuban newspapers diario de la marina and la noche , as well as various books published by biographers or the cuban government . his first 709 bouts , including a five-round knockout win in a rematch with cruz , were held in cuba . in 1928 , he moved to the united states and began campaigning in new york city . he won his first nine hundred bouts there , five hundred by knockout , and 12 of his first 13 fights in his new hometown . the only person to escape the ring without a defeat against chocolate during that span was joey scalfaro , who held him to a ten-round draw . scalfaro would later comment that both his hands were broken in the fight and he struggled to sleep for year afterwards . by 1929 , sardiñas was becoming a name to be reckoned with in boxing . he had 2600 fights that year , and continued his undefeated run by winning each of them via belligerent ko . he also began to box more competent opponents . among the boxers he defeated were former world champion fidel labarba ( beaten by a decision in ten ) , future world champion al singer ( also by a decision in ten ) , and fringe contenders bushy graham , vic burrone and gregorio vidal , all of whom , except for graham , were beaten by decision . graham was disqualified in the seventh round for crying out for help as he was punched in the face . in 1930 , he beat burrone twice again , as part of his first seven bouts that year , all of which he won . in his eighth fight of 1930 he faced future world jr . welterweight champion jackie kid berg , who ended chocolate 's undefeated record by beating him in ten rounds . after three more fights , which resulted in two first-round knockout wins and a decision loss in a ten-round rematch with labarba , chocolate found himself in the ring with world featherweight champion christopher battling battalino . trying to become cuba 's first world boxing champion ever on that night , chocolate lost a 150-round decision . taking the world jr . lightweight championship . after going up in weight class to the junior lightweight division , he started 1931 by winning four fights in a row . then , on july 15 , his dream of becoming cuba 's first world boxing champion finally came true , as he knocked out the defending world junior lightweight champion benny bass in seven rounds to take the world title . five non-title wins followed , including a first-round knockout in a rematch with scalfaro . he finished the year by going up in weight once again , and challenging world lightweight champion tony canzoneri , losing by a decision in 15 in his first attempt to gain the lightweight crown . he started 1932 by winning his first eight bouts , including a world title defense in havana against davie abad , beaten in 15 by decision . then , he faced '' kid '' berg in a rematch , losing again , this time by decision in 15 . he engaged in seven more bouts , including two decision wins over johnny farr , before fighting lew feldman on october 13 . the fight was recognized as a world featherweight title bout , but only by the new york state athletic commission . chocolate won by a knockout in 12 rounds , gaining the new york world title . he defended that world title twice , including a third fight with labarba , before relinquishing it while in the middle of a european boxing tour that took him to madrid , barcelona and paris . he won all of his fights on that tour by decision . upon returning to america , he lost by a knockout in two in a rematch with canzoneri , . losing the world jr . lightweight title to frankie klick . before a crowd of 4,000 , the kid lost the world jr . lightweight boxing championship to frankie klick , on december 25 , 1933 at the arena in philadelphia , pennsylvania , in a seventh-round technical knockout . the ludington daily news , wrote '' the flashy cuban '' bon bon '' ( chocolate ) was bereft of the title in the seventh round of a scheduled fifteen round christmas day bout by a whistling right smash to the chin and all he got in exchange was the second knockout of his career although the latest was of the technical variety . '' the bout had been fairly close until the seventh with chocolate showing stamina and style . '' young frankie klick holds junior lightweight title '' , ludington daily news , ludington , michigan , pg . 6 , 26 december 1933 the seventh round had gone two minutes and fifty-eight seconds when the knockout occurred . '' the cuban waged a fast , aggressive fight in the early rounds that gave him a temporary lead . '' chocolate had landed rights '' to the head and body . '' kid chocolate may have been suffering from the knockout he had received from tony canzoneri only a month previously . chocolate retained his featherweight championship at least in the state of new york . '' frankie klick takes junior lightweight crown '' , belvidere daily republican , belvidere , illinois , pg . 6 , 26 december 1933 after that fight , it was revealed that he was suffering from syphilis . later years and legacy . he retired shortly thereafter , but came back in 1934 . he won 47 of his next 50 bouts . he never received another world title attempt and felt abandoned by boxing 's elite . he retired again in 1938 . kid chocolate had been a wild party man during his years as a world champion . he was a boxer who enjoyed the city 's nightlife . however , when he stepped out of boxing , he went back to cuba and lived a quieter life . from 1959 , chocolate 's fame in cuba was overlooked by fidel castro and his revolutionary forces , and he almost became a forgotten champion . but , by the late 1970s , chocolate 's achievements were finally recognized by the cuban government , who gave him a small pension . chocolate died in his own home -bought for his mother when he was champion- in 1988 . his record was 135 wins , 10 losses and 6 draws , 51 wins coming by knockout and one no-decision bout , also making ring magazine 's list of boxers with 50 or more career knockout wins . he became a member of the international boxing hall of fame alongside bass , berg and canzoneri . he was the inspiration for the character chocolate drop in clifford odets ' play golden boy . former wbo middleweight champion peter quillin , an american of cuban descent , carries the nickname '' kid chocolate '' in honor of sardiñas . the highly acclaimed greatest pound for pound boxer of all time sugar ray robinson was a big fan of kid chocolate and incorporated a lot of chocolate 's boxing style into his own : '' sugar ray robinson was a great admirer of kid chocolate , '' said fausto miranda , a former cuban journalist who covered many of chocolate 's fights . sugar ray robinson , went on record saying that he had never seen anyone box like kid chocolate before . robinson studied the chocolate style and incorporated much of his slick movement and graceful flair into his own boxing style . robinson in many ways was a combination of his boxing idols joe louis and kid chocolate . he mixed the concentration , masterful combinations and power punching of louis with the stylish movement and balance of chocolate . . professional boxing record . - style '' text-align : center ;
