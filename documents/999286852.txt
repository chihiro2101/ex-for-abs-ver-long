Alfred de Musset

biography . musset was born in paris . his family was upper-class but poor and his father worked in various key government positions , but never gave his son any money . his mother came from similar circumstances , and her role as a society hostess – for example her drawing-room parties , luncheons and dinners held in the musset residence – left a lasting impression on young alfred . early indications of musset 's boyhood talents were seen by his fondness for acting impromptu mini-plays based upon episodes from old romance stories he had read . years later , elder brother paul de musset would preserve these , and many other details , for posterity , in a biography on his famous younger brother . alfred de musset entered the lycée henri-iv at the age of nine , where in 1827 he won the latin essay prize in the concours général . with the help of paul foucher , victor hugo 's brother-in-law , he began to attend , at the age of 17 , the cénacle , the literary salon of charles nodier at the bibliothèque de l'arsenal . after attempts at careers in medicine ( which he gave up owing to a distaste for dissections ) , law , drawing , english and piano , he became one of the first romantic writers , with his first collection of poems , contes d'espagne et d'italie ( 1829 , tales of spain and italy ) . by the time he reached the age of 20 , his rising literary fame was already accompanied by a sulphurous reputation fed by his dandy side . he was the librarian of the french ministry of the interior under the july monarchy . his politics were of a liberal stamp and he was on good terms with the family of louis philippe i . during this time he also involved himself in polemics during the rhine crisis of 1840 , caused by the french prime minister adolphe thiers , who as minister of the interior had been musset 's superior . had demanded that france should own the left bank of the rhine ( described as france 's '' natural boundary '' ) , as it had under napoleon , despite the territory 's german population . these demands were rejected by german songs and poems , including nikolaus becker 's rheinlied , which contained the verse : '' sie sollen ihn nicht haben , den freien , deutschen rhein . '' ( they shall not have it , the free , german rhine ) . musset answered to this with a poem of his own : '' nous l'avons eu , votre rhin allemand '' ( we 've had it , your german rhine ) . the tale of his celebrated love affair with george sand in 1833–1835 is told from his point of view in his autobiographical novel la confession d'un enfant du siècle ( the confession of a child of the century ) ( 1836 ) , which was made into a 1999 film , children of the century , and a 2012 film , confession of a child of the century , and is told from her point of view in her elle et lui ( 1859 ) . musset 's nuits ( nights ) ( 1835–1837 ) traces the emotional upheaval of his love for sand from early despair to final resignation . he is also believed to be the anonymous author of gamiani , or two nights of excess ( 1833 ) , a lesbian erotic novel also believed to be modeled on sand . outside of his relationship to sand , he was a well-known figure in brothels and is widely accepted to be the anonymous author-client who beat and humiliated the author and courtesan céleste de chabrillan , also known as la mogador . musset was dismissed from his post as librarian by the new minister ledru-rollin after the revolution of 1848 . he was , however , appointed librarian of the ministry of public instruction in 1853 . on 24 april 1845 musset received the légion d'honneur at the same time as balzac , and was elected to the académie française in 1852 after two failed attempts in 1848 and 1850 . alfred de musset died in his sleep in paris in 1857 . the cause was heart failure , the combination of alcoholism and a longstanding aortic insufficiency . one symptom that had been noticed by his brother was a bobbing of the head as a result of the amplification of the pulse ; this was later called de musset 's sign . '' twelve eponymous signs of aortic regurgitation , one of which was named after a patient instead of a physician '' , in : the american journal of cardiology , vol . 93 , issue 10 , 15 may 2004 , pp . 1332–3 ; by tsung o . cheng md . he was buried in père lachaise cemetery in paris . reception . the french poet arthur rimbaud was highly critical of musset 's work . rimbaud wrote in his letters of a seer ( lettres du voyant ) that musset did not accomplish anything because he '' closed his eyes '' before the visions ( letter to paul demeny , may 1871 ) . director jean renoir 's la règle du jeu ( the rules of the game ) was inspired by musset 's play the moods of marianne . henri gervex 's 1878 painting rolla was based on a poem by de musset . it was rejected by the jury of the salon de paris for immorality , since it features suggestive metaphors in a scene from the poem , with a naked prostitute after having sex with her client , but the controversy helped gervex 's career . music . numerous ( often french ) composers wrote works using musset 's poetry during the 19th and early 20th century . ; opera georges bizet 's opera djamileh ( 1871 , with a libretto by louis gallet ) is based on musset 's story namouna . the play la coupe et les lèvres was the basis of giacomo puccini 's opera edgar ( 1889 ) . dame ethel smyth composed an opera based on fantasio that premiered in weimar in 1898 . the opera andrea del sarto ( 1968 ) by french composer jean-yves daniel-lesur ( 1908–2002 ) was based on musset 's play andré del sarto . lorenzaccio , which takes place in medici 's florence , was set to music by the musician sylvano bussotti in 1972 . ; song bizet set musset 's poem '' a une fleur '' for voice and piano . pauline viardot set musset 's poem '' madrid '' for voice and piano as part of her 6 mélodies ( 1884 ) . the welsh composer morfydd llwyn owen wrote song settings for musset 's '' la tristesse '' and '' chanson de fortunio '' . lili boulanger 's pour les funérailles d'un soldat for baritone , mixed chorus and orchestra is a setting of several lines from act iv of musset 's play la coupe et les lèvres . ; instrumental music ruggero leoncavallo 's symphonic poem '' la nuit de mai '' ( 1886 ) was based on musset 's poetry . mario castelnuovo-tedesco 's cielo di settembre , op . 1 for solo piano ( 1910 ) takes its name from a line of musset 's poem '' a quoi rêvent les jeunes filles '' . the score , in the original publication , is preceded by that line , '' mais vois donc quel beau ciel de septembre… '' rebecca clarke 's viola sonata ( 1919 ) is prefaced by two lines from musset 's la nuit de mai . ; other shane briant plays alfred de musset in a masterpiece theatre production of '' notorious woman '' in 1974 . in 2007 , céline dion recorded a song called '' lettre de george sand à alfred de musset '' for her album d'elles . quotations .
