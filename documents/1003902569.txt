Sugar Minott

biography . after working as a selector on the sound of silence keystone sound system , and then his own gathering of youth system , he began his singing career as part of the african brothers in 1969 , along with tony tuff and derrick howard . the group released several singles in the first half of the 1970s on labels such as micron and their own ital label , and were an early example of the rastafari movement 's influence on the jamaican music scene , taking a clear lead from the abyssinians . after recording '' mysterious nature '' for producer rupie edwards , the group recorded 1974 's '' no cup no broke '' for studio one , breaking up shortly after . minott then teamed up with the producer coxsone dodd , as studio apprentice at dodd 's studio one , working as a singer , guitarist and percussionist , and soon began recording his own singles . larkin , colin : '' the virgin encyclopedia of reggae '' , virgin books , 1998 , minott developed a talent for writing new songs to fit over existing rhythms ( which at the time was common when singers performed live , but rare in the studio ) , often proving more popular than the original songs , pioneering an approach that would be central to the emerging dancehall style . after a number of moderately successful hits for studio one , such as '' vanity '' , '' hang on natty '' , '' mr . dc '' , and '' jah jah children '' , his debut lp live loving made his name and increased his popularity , and is regarded as pioneering the dancehall style that would dominate the early 1980s . it was followed in 1979 with a second album , showcase , which included his singles that had been omitted from the first album . the bittersweet album followed , and then the third album of 1979 , ghetto-ology , which saw a return to roots reggae . roots lovers ( 1980 ) saw a move towards lovers rock , which was a uk hit . he became a bigger star in the uk than in jamaica , his self-produced '' hard time pressure '' being a major uk reggae hit in 1980 , leading minott to relocate to the uk , where he became a focus for uk reggae . singles such as '' run come '' , '' not for sale '' , '' african girl '' , '' lovers rock '' , '' in a dis ya time '' , '' africa '' and '' make it with you '' ( with carroll thompson ) were hits in the years that followed . '' good thing going '' ( a cover of a song originally recorded by michael jackson in 1971 ) was picked up for distribution by rca and reached number 4 in the uk singles chart in march 1981 , leading to an album of the same name . the herbman hustling album saw a return to dancehall and roots reggae . he released an album of recordings from channel one studios , with lots of extra in 1983 , collecting several hits from his time working with winston holness . returning to jamaica , his youth promotion sound system performed regularly in kingston 's maxfield park , featuring jah stitch and newcomers who had been nurtured by his organization such as ranking joe , captain sinbad , and ranking dread . his black roots label featured his productions of these artists plus others such as barry brown , tenor saw , little john , tony tuff , barrington levy , horace andy , and one of his discoveries from england , trevor hartley . minott also produced early works by nitty gritty , junior reid , yami bolo , colourman , daddy freddy and garnett silk . in 1980s he was working with producers in jamaica including , mikey dread , george phang , sly & robbie , philip '' fatis '' burrell , channel one , prince jammy , and donovan germain , as well as recording for united states-based lloyd '' bullwackie '' barnes ( the wicked a go feel it album from 1984 ) . his biggest hits included '' herbman hustling '' , '' no vacancy '' , '' jamming in the street '' , '' rub a dub sound '' , '' buy off the bar '' , '' rydim '' , and '' devil 's pickney '' . he linked up with sly & robbie for 1984 's '' rub a dub sound style '' single , which is regarded as a prototype for the ragga style that developed in the mid-1980s . sugar minott continued to record on his black roots label , youth promotion label and for major and independent labels . his albums receive increasingly exciting reviews . he released over 60 albums and hundreds of singles . sugar is one of the artists who appeared on the ( 2006 ) record , radiodread , released by the easy star label , he provided the guest vocals on the song '' exit music ( for a film ) '' . minott 's desire for independence led him to leave studio one in 1978 and form his own black roots records label and youth promotion organization , the latter with the aim of helping young singers from the same ghetto background as himself . minott also ran the youthman promotion sound-system , giving young performers their first public exposure . youthman promotion has new selectors working alongside the veterans of major stitch , ragga steve and drifter , daddy ants , mr shorty and jimmy knuckles . the selectors most recently added to the sound are digeneral starry b in 2007 , alongside poochiny and jr war , who were added in 2012 . ragga steve has taken full control of the sound with earl minott in the uk . death . minott died on 10 july 2010 at the university hospital of the west indies in st . andrew parish , jamaica , after being admitted earlier that day . the cause of death remains undisclosed . he had been affected by a heart condition since early 2009 , and cancelled several performances in may 2010 due to chest pains .
