'' lovefool '' was a hit worldwide , particularly in the us and japan , where the album reached platinum status in three weeks . the album also achieved gold sales status in the us . '' lovefool '' was shown on mtv in the late 1990s as a music video with clips from the 1996 hit film romeo + juliet starring leonardo dicaprio and claire danes . it also featured in the film cruel intentions ( 1999 ) . in 1997 , the band played themselves in an episode of beverly hills , 90210 as the featured entertainment at their college graduation party , hosted by kelly taylor 's dad . the band performed '' lovefool '' and '' been it . '' the band was also asked to submit the theme song for the james bond film tomorrow never dies but rejected the request due to exhaustion that would be exacerbated by the potential added workload ; persson has called her decision to turn down the offer '' one of my biggest mistakes . '' 1998 's gran turismo was followed by a long hiatus during which the band members pursued solo side projects . the same year they also released a compilation album of rare b-sides , the other side of the moon as a japan-only release . the video of the song '' my favourite game '' was censored by mtv for showing reckless driving . despite this , it went on to become their second global hit song . '' my favourite game '' was featured on the soundtrack of the playstation video game gran turismo 2 in the intro movie on cd1 . that year also saw their song '' deuce '' appearing on the x-files : the album . their song '' erase/rewind '' was featured in the 1999 films never been kissed and the thirteenth floor . thumb in 1999 , the cardigans recorded a duet cover of talking heads ' '' burning down the house '' with tom jones for his album reload . . back to spotlight and hiatus : 2002–2006 . the cardigans returned in 2002 to record long gone before daylight ( 2003 ) , a collection of songs mainly written by persson and svensson . long gone before daylight became one of the best selling albums in sweden in 2003 . after a two-year hiatus from their last album , it was released in japan on 19 march 2003 and in europe on 24 march 2003 . later it was also released in canada ( 22 april 2003 ) and the united states ( 25 may 2004 ) . the album differs from the band 's earlier works . their familiar '' happy '' pop sound takes on a change to pop songs with more of an american country music influence . it is a much darker album than their previous works , and quieter than gran turismo . indeed , even lead singer nina persson dyed her once light blonde hair to jet black , reflecting the band 's change of mood . amelia mcdonell-parry . '' long gone before daylight : the cardigans : review '' , rolling stone , 24 july 2004 . the album was produced by per sunding after the group 's regular producer tore johanssen stepped down , feeling himself unable to provide the country sound the group wanted . criticism was generally mixed . some found the change of direction welcome , and felt the band had matured , making songs that were even better than other experienced country-pop styled artists . others missed the old pop sound , and accused the band of possibly being ashamed of their former '' happy '' pop sound . the first single of the album , '' for what it 's worth '' was released on 17 february 2003 . the second single was '' you 're the storm '' released on 2 june 2003 . the third and final single was '' live and learn '' released on 3 december 2003 . in the summer of 2004 , the cardigans toured with liz phair , katy rose and charlotte martin on the chicks with attitude tour . on 28 april 2005 , the band 's itunes originals album was released through itunes . on 19 october 2005 , the band released their sixth album super extra gravity to generally favourable reviews . super extra gravity went straight to the 1 spot on the swedish album chart and was certified gold ( sales over 40,000 ) . after the band finished promotional activities in autumn 2006 , the band entered an extended hiatus and devoted themselves to other projects . reunion and tour : 2012–present . in 2012 , the cardigans received a lucrative offer from hultsfred festival to perform the album gran turismo in full . after initial hesitation , the band decided to accept the offer '' as it felt like a good way of tearing us out of our strange new everyday life , '' according to persson . peter svensson declined to participate , although he had no objection to the band touring without him . they recruited singer-songwriter : sv : moto boy to fill in for svensson , and asked their agent to seek more shows for them to play . ultimately , the band made their live comeback with shows in lund and copenhagen ahead of hultsfred , before playing in poland , finland , russia , indonesia , taiwan and japan , with a scheduled concert in israel cancelled by the promoter . most of these shows involved performing gran turismo in full , followed by an assortment of hits from their other albums . still with humlebo in place of svensson , the band played career-spanning sets when touring resumed during late 2013 with shows in japan , china and russia , followed by more dates in 2015 which took them to south korea , europe and south america . in interviews promoting her 2014 solo album animal heart , persson suggested that the success of their most recent live dates opened the possibility for future cardigans recordings , though there were no firm plans . '' it 's really fun to do greatest hits things , since there 's nothing else , but i think if we continue having this much fun we would like to make another record , because we like to create new things , '' said persson . the band 's only scheduled show for 2016 was at qstock ( oulu , finland ) on 29 july . in 2017 , they performed in stockholm in turku , finland and in yammatovo 3 festival in croatia . in june 2018 , the band announced their only live shows of the year : a four-date uk tour in december to celebrate the 20th anniversary of gran turismo in which they would perform the album in full again . in an interview to promote the tour , persson stated , '' there won ’ t be any more cardigans records , i ’ m pretty sure . but we ’ ll keep doing little tours and shows as long as it ’ s fun , as long as we can do it well and feel that it ’ s something that ’ s current to us . '' . solo projects . during the band 's first break nina persson released an album as a camp , and peter svensson and bengt lagerberg worked on the project paus with help from joakim berg from kent , and magnus sveningsson recorded as righteous boy . in 2006 , sveningsson restarted their old label trampolene and became an a & r for it . the first signing was the swedish popband the animal five , which was a minor success in sweden and germany . lagerberg and johansson formed the group brothers of end , releasing a debut album the end in 2009 , and a second album mount inside in 2011 . a third album , shakers love , was released in 2014 , and nina persson appeared on the track '' heat '' . in november 2006 , persson featured on the cake sale , an album set up by oxfam . it contained nine tracks from some of ireland 's leading artists . proceeds from the album went to the fair trade campaign . persson also appeared on the manic street preachers ' album send away the tigers ( may 2007 ) , providing guest vocals on the uk chart 2 single '' your love alone is not enough '' . she shared vocals with manics frontman james dean bradfield , who also appeared on stage with the band at the glastonbury festival 2007 , and who has rated peter svensson as his second favourite guitarist . in the band 's break of 2007 , persson recorded the second a camp album colonia , which was released in early 2009 . a camp supported the us release of colonia with a tour , which began in new york city on 26 may and completed on 15 june in los angeles . in 2010 , persson appeared on danger mouse & sparklehorse 's collaboration ( dark night of the soul ) singing '' daddy 's gone '' ( with mark linkous ) . image : nina persson 2.jpg 200px right thumb nina persson in concert persson released the album animal heart under her own name in 2014 . band members . lars-olof johansson & ndash ; keyboards , piano , guitar bengt lagerberg & ndash ; drums , percussion nina persson & ndash ; lead vocals , keyboards magnus sveningsson & ndash ; bass , vocals peter svensson & ndash ; guitar , vocals . awards and nominations . bmi pop awards - 1999 '' lovefool '' award-winning song billboard music awards - 1997 '' lovefool '' top hot 100 airplay track billboard music video awards - 1997 '' lovefool '' pop/rock clip of the year brit awards - 2000 themselves best international group danish music awards - 2000 gran turismo foreign album of the year denmark gaffa awards ! ref . - rowspan 2 1998 rowspan 2 '' my favorite game '' best foreign video rowspan 4 - rowspan 2 best foreign hit - 1999 '' burning down the house '' ( with tom jones ) - 2005 nina persson best foreign female act grammis - 1995 rowspan 3 themselves rowspan 2 best pop group - rowspan 4 1997 - best artist rowspan 3 - first band on the moon best album - '' lovefool '' best song - rowspan 5 1999 rowspan 2 themselves best pop group - best artist - gran turismo best album - rowspan 2 '' my favorite game '' best song rowspan 2 - best music video - rowspan 2 2004 long gone before daylight best album rowspan 2 - rowspan 2 themselves rowspan 2 best rock group - 2006 mtv europe music awards - 1996 themselves best new act rowspan 6 - 1997 '' lovefool '' best song - rowspan 3 1999 rowspan 4 themselves best group - best rock - rowspan 2 best nordic act - 2003 rockbjornen - 1998 themselves best swedish band smash hits poll winners party ! ref . - 1996 themselves best international band tmf awards - 1999 '' my favorite game '' best video international . discography . emmerdale ( 1994 ) life ( 1995 ) first band on the moon ( 1996 ) gran turismo ( 1998 ) long gone before daylight ( 2003 ) super extra gravity ( 2005 ) . see also . swedish music abroad list of hfstival acts swedish indie pop swedish rock . references . external links . official website
