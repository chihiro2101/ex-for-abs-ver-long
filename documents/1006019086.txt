Handley Page

history . frederick handley page first experimented with and built several biplanes and monoplanes at premises in woolwich , fambridge and barking creek . his company , founded on 17 june 1909 , became the first british public company to build aircraft . in 1912 , handley page established an aircraft factory at cricklewood after moving from barking . aircraft were built there , and flown from the company 's adjacent airfield known as cricklewood aerodrome , which was later used by handley page transport . the factory was later sold off to oswald stoll and converted into britain 's largest film studios , cricklewood studios . world war i . during the first world war , handley page produced a series of heavy bombers for the royal navy to bomb the german zeppelin yards , with the ultimate intent of bombing berlin in revenge for the zeppelin attacks on london . handley page had been asked by the admiralty to produce a '' bloody paralyser of an aeroplane '' . these aircraft included the o/100 of 1915 , the o/400 of 1918 and the four-engined v/1500 with the range to reach berlin . the v/1500 had only just entered operational service as the war ended in 1918 . the handley page factory at radlett aerodrome employed women as part of the war effort , and was visited by royalty . . interwar period . in early 1919 , a handley page v/1500 aircraft , dubbed atlantic , was shipped to newfoundland to attempt the world 's first non-stop transatlantic flight ; kaiser 's bunker only to be beaten by a vickers vimy piloted by alcock and brown in june of that year . the atlantic flew into new york city via canada on 9 october 1919 , carrying the first airmail from canada to the united states . in the immediate postwar years , handley page modified a number of o/400 's to passenger use , which they flew on the london-paris route as handley page transport . the v/1500 was considered too large to be practical at the time , but a number of design features of the v/1500 were later incorporated into an o/400 airframe to produce their first dedicated passenger design , the w.8 that led to a series of similar airliners , fitted with two or three engines , which , aside from being used by handley page transport , were also exported to belgium . in 1924 handley page transport merged with two other airlines to create imperial airways , as the uk 's national airline service , which continued to use a number of the w.8 , w.9 and w.10 series of airliners . handley page continued to develop large biplane airliners , including the luxurious handley page h.p.42 , for use on imperial routes to africa and india . handley page developed the handley page slat ( or slot ) , an auxiliary airfoil mounted ahead and above the wing , which formed a narrow gap which improved airflow at high angle of attack and improved low speed handling . f . handley page '' developments in aircraft design by the use of slotted wings '' flight , 22 december 1921 , page 844 and page 845 the leading edge slat was simultaneously designed by the german aerodynamicist gustav lachmann , who was later employed by handley page . the design was so successful that licensing fees to other companies was their main source of income in the early 1920s . in 1929 , cricklewood aerodrome was closed and handley page moved aircraft final assembly to radlett aerodrome . cricklewood aerodrome was taken over by cricklewood studios , the largest film studio in the uk at that time . manufacture of aircraft parts and sub-assemblies continued until 1964 at cricklewood when the remainder of the site was sold off and a wickes home renovation store currently occupies the site . world war ii . with the second world war looming , handley page designed and produced the hp.52 hampden bomber , which took part in the first british raid on berlin . in response to a 1936 government request for heavier , longer ranged aircraft , handley page tendered the hp.56 design powered by twin rolls-royce vultures and this was ordered , along with what became the avro manchester . however the vulture proved so troublesome that – years before the engine was abandoned by rolls-royce in 1940 – the air staff decided that the hp.56 should be fitted with four engines instead . therefore , before reaching prototype stage , the hp.56 design was reworked into the four-engined hp.57 halifax . buttler p102-104 the halifax became the second most-prolific british heavy bomber of the war after the avro lancaster ( itself essentially a four-engine development of the manchester ) . although in some respects ( such as crew survivability ) better than the lancaster , the halifax suffered in terms of altitude performance buttler p129 and was redeployed toward the end of the war as a heavy transport and glider tug , with several variants being specifically built as such , including the hp.70 halton . postwar . after the war , the british government sought tenders for jet bombers to carry the nation 's nuclear deterrent . the three types produced were known as the v bombers , and handley page 's contribution was the hp.80 victor , a four-engined , crescent-winged design . this aircraft remained in service ( as a tanker aircraft ) well beyond the demise of the company which created it . in 1947 handley page bought some of the assets of the bankrupt miles aircraft company . these assets include existing designs , tools and jigs , most notably for the miles m.52 supersonic research aircraft , and the miles site at woodley , near reading . the operation was named handley page ( reading ) ltd , a company constituted to buy and operate the assets formed out of the inactive handley page transport ltd . the most significant of the inherited designs became the herald airliner . designs from the reading site used the initials hpr ( '' handley page ( reading ) '' ) . demise . unlike other large british aircraft manufacturers , handley page resisted the government 's pressure to merge into larger entities . by the late 1960s , the british aviation industry was dominated by two companies : hawker siddeley and the british aircraft corporation . unable to compete for government orders or build large commercial aircraft , handley page produced its final notable handley page design , the jetstream . this was a small turboprop-powered commuter aircraft , with a pressurised cabin and a passenger capacity of 12 to 18 . it was designed primarily for the united states '' feederliner '' market . although successful , the jetstream was too late to save handley page , and the company went into voluntary liquidation in march 1970 and was wound up after 61 years trading under the same name . the jetstream lived on , the design being purchased and produced by scottish aviation at prestwick , continuing after the company was bought by british aerospace in 1977 . sites . radlett aerodrome was opened in 1929 as a grass aerodrome for handley page civil aircraft . its runway was extended in 1939 to enable production of halifax bombers . by the time of its closure the airfield had two runways : 03/21 approximately 15/33 approximately most of the towers , hangars and runways were demolished in the 1970s after the company was terminated . the m25 motorway now runs on the south side of the site , with lafarge ( company ) now owning the remainder . the runway surface was removed and replaced with grass , but a shadow remains when viewed from the air . products . designations . handley page originally used a letter sequence to designate types ( i.e . a , b , c etc . ) . beginning with the model e , the letter was used in combination with a slash and a number that referred to the installed horsepower , at least initially . however the 100 in o/100 indicated the type 's 100-foot wingspan , while other designs it may or may not have been meaningful other than as a design sequence . by 1923 , the company had come to the end of the alphabet and had begun reusing earlier letters , but this would have become confusing , so from 1924 they assigned the letters hp and a sequential number to indicate the model , with previous aircraft being retroactively assigned numbers in the new sequence , starting with the type a as the hp.1 . thus the o/400 became the hp.16 and the w.8 the hp.18 . unbuilt projects were skipped from this sequence . when the assets of miles aircraft were taken over , the latter 's reading design office used hpr for handley page reading , followed by a number as with the hpr.1 marathon . designs . . first letter
