Spin Doctors

history . the group originated in the late 1980s in new york city , originally as a band called trucking company ; this band included canadian guitarist eric schenkman , harmonicist john popper , and later vocalist chris barron , who was popper 's princeton , new jersey high school friend . popper left this side project to focus on his main gig with blues traveler full-time . with a name change to spin doctors , as well as the addition of aaron comess on drums and mark white on bass , the classic lineup was in place by the spring of 1989 . spin doctors signed with epic records/sony music a & r executive frankie larocka in 1990 . the band 's epic debut ep up for grabs.live was recorded live at the wetlands preserve in lower manhattan , and released in january 1991 . ( in november 1992 , these ep tracks were remixed and supplemented by additional live recordings to form the album homebelly groove.live . ) spin doctors were known for their somewhat lengthy live shows , sometimes jamming even more than is evident on their live releases . they also often performed double-bill gigs opening for blues traveler , with members of both bands all jamming together as the transition from spin doctors set into the blues traveler set . spin doctors have many songs from their early club days that were never officially released , but remain circulated via concert recordings . spin doctors 's debut studio album pocket full of kryptonite was released in august 1991 . the band continued to play extensive live shows , gaining grassroots fans , as the album was mostly ignored commercially . in the summer of 1992 , the band toured with the first lineup of the h.o.r.d.e . festival , sharing the stage with fellow jam bands widespread panic , blues traveler , and phish . that summer , sleeper hit , as radio and mtv began playing '' little miss ca n't be wrong '' and '' two princes '' , with the videos directed by filmmaker rich murray ( who would direct many of the band 's videos ) . the album went gold in september 1992 , and then received another boost in sales after the band 's appearance on saturday night live in october 1992 . additional videos and singles followed for '' what time is it , '' '' how could you want him ( when you know you could have me ? ) , '' and '' jimmy olsen 's blues . '' by june 1993 , the album went triple platinum . ultimately it sold over five million copies in the u.s . and another five million overseas , and peaked at no . & nbsp ; 3 on the billboard 200 albums chart . '' their popularity is based on universal rock & roll virtues , '' said rolling stone , which put the band on the cover of its january 7 , 1993 issue . '' the doctors are n't trying to blaze new trails . they know we 've been down this way with the stones , curtis mayfield , and a few of their other touchstones . but the proof & mdash ; plenty of it & mdash ; is in the party . '' spin doctors made an appearance on sesame street ( episode 3450 ) , singing a modified version of '' two princes '' that emphasized the importance of sharing . in 1993 , they recorded covers of '' have you ever seen the rain ? '' , originally by creedence clearwater revival , for the film philadelphia and '' spanish castle magic '' for stone free : a tribute to jimi hendrix . spin doctors 's second studio album , turn it upside down , released in june 1994 , was not as commercially successful as pocket full of kryptonite , although it did sell a million copies in the united states and another million internationally . the second single , '' you let your heart go too fast '' , was a modest hit ( 42 on the pop chart ) . this album also featured '' cleopatra 's cat '' , '' mary jane '' , '' hungry hamed 's '' , and '' bags of dirt '' . the band set out on a three-month headlining tour , and played to large crowds at woodstock '94 and the glastonbury festival . shortly after the release of turn it upside down , original guitarist eric schenkman left the band in september 1994 by walking offstage during a concert in berkeley , california citing musical and personal differences , and being weary of the road . schenkman was replaced by anthony krizan . featuring new guitarist krizan , spin doctors released you 've got to believe in something in may 1996 . it produced the single and video '' she used to be mine '' . they performed on the late show with david letterman and did some touring , with ivan neville joining the band on keyboards . during this period , spin doctors contributed the theme song to seasons 2 and 3 of the television show spin city . after touring wrapped up in the fall of 1996 , krizan eventually left the band , for reasons that remain relatively unknown . he was replaced by israeli musician eran tabib after auditioning nearly 200 candidates . you 've got to believe in something did not live up to previous album sales , selling only 75,000 copies . epic dropped the band in 1996 . in 1998 , spin doctors signed to uptown/universal and released here comes the bride in june 1999 . during the recording of here comes the bride , mark white left the band . the bass tracks on the album were finished by original band member aaron comess . during the tour supporting here comes the bride , barron lost his voice due to a rare acute form of vocal cord paralysis that severely affected his ability to talk , let alone sing . he was told he had a 50-50 chance of ever talking or singing normally again . keyboardist ivan neville also took over vocal duties for a few dates , but the band eventually cancelled the remainder of its tour . barron 's voice came back in early 2000 ( first comeback solo shows in march 2000 ) , at which point he began performing with his band and the give daddy five . barron undertook what he calls '' a journeyman songwriting experience , '' composing tunes with blues traveler 's john popper and with former bmi executive jeff cohen . spin doctors remained inactive as a band until september 2001 , when news about the closing of wetlands sparked the original four members to reunite . on september 7 , 2001 , the original lineup took the stage for the first time since 1994 to play at wetlands . it was the final closing week of the club . the landmark show was a great success for the fans and the band . odd shows followed in 2002 through 2005 , which eventually led to a brand new studio album , nice talking to me , released on september 13 , 2005 . the single '' ca n't kick the habit '' was included on the soundtrack to the movie grandma 's boy . it received moderate radio airplay , along with the songs '' margarita '' and the title track '' nice talking to me '' . while the record received good reviews , follow-up proved difficult when the record company that released it went out of business . in 2008 , the band continued to play one-off live shows in the united states and europe . drummer aaron comess released an instrumental record of all his own compositions entitled catskills cry featuring bassist tony levin and guitarist bill dillon . in 2009 , barron released the solo record pancho and the kid on valley entertainment . during the summer of 2010 , barron released songs from the summer of sangria . this five-song ep was his first official release with his band the time bandits . in 2011 , the band celebrated the 20-year anniversary of pocket full of kryptonite with a uk and us tour . sony legacy released a 20th anniversary edition with bonus material on august 29 , 2011 . in april 2013 , the band released if the river was whiskey , their sixth studio album . . members . ;
