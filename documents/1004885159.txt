life and work . file : domenico quaglio marktkirche hannover.jpg thumb hanover 's market church oil painting after domenico quaglio ( 1832 ) karl friedrich von schlegel was born on 10 march 1772 at hanover , where his father , johann adolf schlegel , was the pastor at the lutheran market church . for two years he studied law at göttingen and leipzig , and he met with friedrich schiller . in 1793 he devoted himself entirely to literary work . in 1796 he moved to jena , where his brother august wilhelm lived , and here he collaborated with novalis , ludwig tieck , fichte , and caroline schelling , who married august wilhelm . novalis and schlegel had a famous conversation about german idealism . in 1797 he quarreled with schiller , who did not like his polemic work . ernst behler , german romantic literary theory , 1993 , p . 36 . schlegel published die griechen und römer ( the greeks and romans ) , which was followed by geschichte der poesie der griechen und römer ( history of the poesy of the greeks and romans ) ( 1798 ) . then he turned to dante , goethe , and shakespeare . in jena he and his brother founded the journal athenaeum , contributing fragments , aphorisms , and essays in which the principles of the romantic school are most definitely stated . they are now generally recognized as the deepest and most significant expressions of the subjective idealism of the early romanticists . after a controversy , friedrich decided to move to berlin . there he lived with friedrich schleiermacher and met henriette herz , rahel varnhagen , and his future wife , dorothea veit , a daughter of moses mendelssohn and the mother of johannes and philipp veit . in 1799 he published lucinde , an eccentric and unfinished novel , which is remarkable as an attempt to transfer to practical ethics the romantic demand for complete individual freedom . lucinde , in which he extolled the union of sensual and spiritual love as an allegory of the divine cosmic eros , caused a great scandal by its manifest autobiographical character , mirroring his liaison with dorothea veit , and it contributed to the failure of his academic career in jena where he completed his studies in 1801 and lectured as a privatdozent on transcendental philosophy . in september 1800 he met four times with goethe , who would later stage his tragedy alarcos ( 1802 ) in weimar , albeit with a notable lack of success . in june 1802 he arrived in paris , where he lived in the house formerly owned by baron d'holbach and joined a circle including heinrich christoph kolbe . he lectured on philosophy in private courses for sulpiz boisserée , and under the tutelage of antoine-léonard de chézy and linguist alexander hamilton he continued to study sanskrit and the persian language . he edited the journal europa ( 1803 ) , where he published essays about gothic architecture and the old masters . in april 1804 he married dorothea veit in the swedish embassy in paris , after she had undergone the requisite conversion from judaism to protestantism . in 1806 he and his wife went to visit aubergenville , where his brother lived with madame de staël . in 1808 , he published an epoch-making book , über die sprache und weisheit der indier ( on the language and wisdom of india ) . here he advanced his ideas about religion and importantly argued that out of india theory . schlegel compared sanskrit with latin , greek , persian and german , noting many similarities in vocabulary and grammar . the assertion of the common features of these languages is now generally accepted , albeit with significant revisions . there is less agreement about the geographic region where these precursors settled , although the out-of-india model has generally become discredited . in 1808 , he and his wife joined the roman catholic church in the cologne cathedral . from this time on , he became more and more opposed to the principles of political and religious liberalism . he went to vienna and in 1809 was appointed imperial court secretary at the military headquarters , editing the army newspaper and issuing fiery proclamations against napoleon . he accompanied archduke charles , duke of teschen to war and was stationed in pest during the war of the fifth coalition . here he studied the hungarian language . meanwhile he had published his collected geschichte ( histories ) ( 1809 ) and two series of lectures , über die neuere geschichte ( on recent history ) ( 1811 ) and geschichte der alten und neuen literatur ( on old and new literature ) ( 1815 ) . in 1814 he was knighted in the supreme order of christ . following the congress of vienna ( 1815 ) , he was councilor of legation in the austrian embassy at the frankfurt diet , but in 1818 he returned to vienna . in 1819 he and clemens brentano made a trip to rome , in the company of metternich and gentz . there he met with his wife and her sons . in 1820 he started a conservatism catholic magazine , concordia ( 1820–1823 ) , but was criticized by metternich and by his brother august wilhelm , then professor of indology in bonn and busy publishing the bhagavad gita . schlegel began the issue of his sämtliche werke ( collected works ) . he also delivered lectures , which were republished in his philosophie des lebens ( philosophy of life ) ( 1828 ) and in his philosophie der geschichte ( philosophy of history ) ( 1829 ) . he died on 12 january 1829 at dresden , while preparing a series of lectures . dorothea schlegel . friedrich schlegel 's wife , dorothea von schlegel , authored an unfinished romance , florentin ( 1802 ) , a sammlung romantischer dichtungen des mittelalters ( collection of romantic poems of the middle ages ) ( 2 vols . , 1804 ) , a version of lother und maller ( 1805 ) , and a translation of madame de staël 's corinne ( 1807–1808 ) — all of which were issued under her husband 's name . by her first marriage she had two sons , johannes and philipp veit , who became eminent
