Sejong the Great

name . although the appellation '' the great '' ； was given posthumously to almost every ruler of goryeo and joseon , this title is usually associated with gwanggaeto and sejong . early life . sejong was born on 7 may 1397 , the third son of king taejong . encyclopedia of world history , vol ii , p362 sejong , edited by marsha e . ackermann , michael j . schroeder , janice j . terry , jiu-hwa lo upshur , mark f . whitters , when he was twelve , he became grand prince chungnyeong ( 충녕대군 ) . as a young prince , sejong was favored by king taejong over his two older brothers . as the third son of taejong , sejong 's ascension to the throne was unique . taejong 's eldest son , yangnyeong , was named heir apparent in 1404 . however , yangnyeong 's free spirited nature as well as his preference for hunting and leisure activities resulted in his removal from the position of heir apparent in june 1418 . though it is said that yangnyeong abdicated in favor of his younger brother , there are no definitive records regarding yangnyeong 's removal . taejong 's second son grand prince hyoryeong became a monk upon the elevation of his younger brother sejong . following the removal of yangnyeong as heir apparent , taejong moved quickly to secure his youngest son 's position as heir apparent . the government was purged of officials who disagreed with the removal of yangnyeong . in august 1418 , taejong abdicated in favour of sejong . however , even in retirement taejong continued to influence government policy . sejong 's surprising political skill and creativity did not become apparent until after taejong 's death in 1422 . . governance . religion . king sejong reorganized the korean government by appointing people from different social classes as civil servants . furthermore , he performed official government events according to confucianism , and he encouraged people to behave according to the teachings of confucianism . as a result , confucianism became the social norm of korea at the time . he suppressed buddhism by banning outside buddhist monks from entering seoul and reduced the seven schools of buddhism down to two , seon and gyo , drastically reducing the power and wealth of the buddhist hierarchy . in 1427 , sejong also ordered a decree against the huihui ( korean muslim ) community that had had special status and stipends since the yuan dynasty . the huihui were forced to abandon their headgear , to close down their '' ceremonial hall '' ( mosque in the city of kaesong ) and worship like everyone else . no further mention of muslims exist during the era of the joseon . . foreign policy . he collaborated closely with the chinese ming dynasty . in relationship with jurchen people , he installed 10 military posts , 4 counties and 6 garrisons ( hangul : 사군육진 hanja : 四郡六鎭 ) , in the northern part of the korean peninsula . he opened three ports to trade with japan . however , he also launched the ōei invasion to crush japanese pirates ( wokou ) in the east china sea . military . king sejong was an effective military planner . he created various military regulations to strengthen the safety of his kingdom , > ( learning sejong silok in one book ) supported the advancement of korean military technology , including cannon development . different kinds of mortars and fire arrows were tested as well as the use of gunpowder . in may 1419 , king sejong , under the advice and guidance of his father taejong , embarked upon the ōei invasion , the ultimate goal of this military expedition to remove the nuisance of japanese pirates who had been operating out of tsushima island . during the expedition , 245 japanese were killed , and another 110 were captured in combat , while 180 korean soldiers were killed . 146 chinese and 8 korean kidnapped were liberated by this expedition . in september 1419 a truce was made and the korean army returned to korea , but the treaty of gyehae was signed in 1443 , in which the daimyo of tsushima promised to pay tribute to the king of joseon ; in return , the joseon court rewarded the sō clan with preferential rights regarding trade between japan and korea . in 1433 , sejong sent kim jongseo ( hangul : 김종서 , hanja : 金宗瑞 ) , a prominent general , north to destroy the jurchens ( later known as the manchus ) . kim 's military campaign captured several castles , pushed north , and expanded korean territory , to the songhua river . > ( learning sejong silok in one book ) 4 counties and 6 garrisons were established to safeguard the people from the jurchens . science , technology , and agriculture . sejong promoted the sciences . he wanted to help farmers so he decided to create a farmer 's handbook . the book—the nongsa jikseol ( hangul : 농사직설 , hanja : 農事直說 ) —contained information about the different farming techniques that he told scientists to gather in different regions of korea . these techniques were needed in order to maintain the newly adopted methods of intensive , continuous cultivation in korean agriculture . one of his close associates was the great korean inventor jang yeong-sil ( hangul : 장영실 , hanja : 蔣英實 ) . jang was naturally a creative and smart thinker as a young person . sejong noticed jang 's skill and immediately called him to his court in seoul . upon giving jang a government position and funding for his inventions , officials protested , believing a person from the lower classes should not rise to power among nobles . sejong instead believed jang merited support because of his ability . jang created new significant designs for water clocks , armillary spheres , and sundials . in 1442 , jang made one of the world 's first standardized rain gauges named cheugugi . this model has not survived , since the oldest existing korean rain gauge is one made in 1770 , during the reign period of king yeongjo . according to the daily records of the royal secretariat ( hangul : 승정원일기；hanja : 承政院日記 ) , king yeongjo wanted to revive the glorious times of king sejong the great , and so read chronicles of sejong 's era . when he came across mention of a rain gauge , king yeongjo ordered a reproduction . since there is a mark of the qing dynasty ruler qianlong ( r . 1735–1796 ) of china , dated 1770 , kim ( 1998 ) , 51 . this korean-designed rain gauge is seen as having been imported from china . sejong also wanted to reform the korean calendar system , which was at the time based upon the longitude of the chinese capital . kim ( 1998 ) , 57 . sejong had his astronomers create a calendar with the joseon capital of seoul as the primary meridian . this new system allowed korean astronomers to accurately predict the timing of solar and lunar eclipses . in the realm of traditional korean medicine , two important treatises were written during his reign . these were the hyangyak jipseongbang and the euibang yuchwi , which historian kim yongsik says represents '' koreans ' efforts to develop their own system of medical knowledge , distinct from that of china . '' . humanitarianism . in 1426 , sejong the great enacted a law that granted government nobi women 100 days of maternity leave after childbirth , which , in 1430 , was lengthened by one month before childbirth . in 1434 , sejong also granted the husbands 30 days of paternity leave . in order to provide equality and fairness in taxation for the common people , sejong the great issued a royal decree to administer a nationwide public opinion poll regarding a new tax system called gongbeop in 1430 . over the course of 5 months , the poll surveyed 172,806 people , of which approximately 57 % responded with approval for the proposed reform . sejong depended on the agricultural produce of joseon 's farmers , so he allowed them to pay more or less tax according to fluctuations of economic prosperity or hard times . because of this , farmers could worry less about tax quotas and work instead at surviving and selling their crops . once the palace had a significant surplus of food , king sejong then distributed food to poor peasants or farmers who needed it . literature . in 1429 nongsa-jikseol ( hangul : 농사직설 , hanja : 農事直說 , '' explanations of agriculture '' ) was compiled . it was the first book about korean farming , dealing with agricultural subjects such as planting , harvesting , and soil treatment . most government officials opposed usage of hangul , preferring to continue to use hanja . sejong was also a writer . he composed the famous yongbi eocheon ga ( '' songs of flying dragons '' , 1445 ) , seokbo sangjeol ( '' episodes from the life of buddha '' , july 1447 ) , worin cheon-gang jigok ( '' songs of the moon shining on a thousand rivers '' , july 1447 ) , and the reference dongguk jeong-un ( '' dictionary of proper sino-korean pronunciation '' , september 1447 ) . in 1420 sejong established the hall of worthies ; ; jiphyeonjeon ) at the gyeongbokgung palace . it consisted of scholars selected by the king . the hall participated in various scholarly endeavors , of which the best known may be the compilation of the hunmin jeongeum . . hangul . king sejong the great profoundly affected korean history with his personal creation and introduction of hangul , the native phonetic writing system for the korean language . kim jeong su ( 1990 ) , > ( history and future of hangul ) although it is widely assumed that king sejong ordered the hall of worthies to invent hangul , contemporary records such as the veritable records of king sejong and jeong inji 's preface to the hunminjeongeum haerye emphasize that he invented it himself . before the creation of hangul , people in korea ( known as joseon at the time ) primarily wrote using classical chinese alongside phonetic writing systems based on chinese script that predated hangul by hundreds of years , including idu , hyangchal , gugyeol , and gakpil . however , due to the fundamental differences between the korean and chinese languages , hunmin jeongeum haerye , postface of jeong inji , p . 27a , translation from gari k . ledyard , the korean language reform of 1446 , p . 258 and the large number of characters that needed to be learned , there was much difficulty in learning how to write using chinese characters for the lower classes , who often lacked the privilege of education . to assuage this problem , king sejong created the unique alphabet known as hangul to promote literacy among the common people . king sejong created the korean alphabet ( which numbered 28 letters at its introduction , of which four letters have become obsolete ) , with the explicit goal being that koreans from all classes would read and write . each consonant letter is based on a simplified diagram of the patterns made by the human speech organs ( the mouth , tongue and teeth ) when producing the sound related to the character , while vowels were formed by combinations of dots and lines representing heaven ( a circular dot ) , earth ( a horizontal line ) and humanity ( a vertical line ) . morphemes are built by writing the characters in syllabic blocks . the blocks of letters are then strung together linearly . hangul was completed in 1443 and published in 1446 along with a 33-page manual titled hunmin jeong-eum , explaining what the letters are as well as the philosophical theories and motives behind them . korean spirit and culture promotion project . fifty wonders of korea volume i : culture and art . 2nd ed . seoul : samjung munhwasa , 2009 . 28-35 . the hunmin jeong-eum purported that anyone could learn hangul in a matter of days . people previously unfamiliar with hangul can typically pronounce korean script accurately after only a few hours of study . death and legacy . sejong was blinded years later by diabetes complications that eventually took his life in 1450 . he was buried at the yeong mausoleum ; . his successor was his first son , munjong . sejong judged that his sickly son , munjong , was unlikely to live long and on his deathbed asked the hall of worthies scholars to look after his young grandson , danjong . as predicted , munjong died two years after his accession , and political stability enjoyed under sejong disintegrated when danjong became the sixth king of joseon at the age of twelve . eventually , sejong 's second son , sejo , usurped the throne from danjong in 1455 . when the six martyred ministers were implicated in a plot to restore danjong to throne , sejo abolished the hall of worthies , and executed danjong and several ministers who served during sejong 's reign . the street sejongno and the sejong center , both located in central seoul , are named after king sejong . a portrait of sejong is featured on the 10,000 won banknote of the south korean won , along with various scientific tools invented under his reign . in early 2007 , the south korea government decided to create a special administrative district from part of the present chungcheongnam-do province , near what is presently daejeon . the district was named sejong special autonomous city . the life of sejong was depicted in the kbs korean historical drama king sejong the great in 2008 . sejong is also depicted in the 2011 sbs drama deep rooted tree and 2016 kbs1 drama jang yeong-sil . family . father : taejong of joseon ( 13 june 1367 – 30 may 1422 ) ( 조선 태종 ) grandfather : taejo of joseon ( 27 october 1335 – 18 june 1408 ) ( 조선 태조 ) grandmother : queen sinui ( september 1337 – 21 october 1391 ) ( 신의왕후 한씨 ) mother : queen wongyeong ( 11 july 1365 – 10 july 1420 ) ( 원경왕후 민씨 ) grandfather : min je ( 1339 – 1408 ) ( 민제 ) grandmother : lady song of the yeosan song clan ( 1342 – 1424 ) ( 여산 송씨 ) consorts and their respective issue ( s ) : queen soheon ( 12 october 1395 – 19 april 1446 ) ( 소헌왕후 심씨 ) daughter of sim on ( 심온 , 1375 – 25 december 1418 ) , lord anhyo ( 안효공 ) , internal prince cheongcheon ( 청천부원군 ) ;
