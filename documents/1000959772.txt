Loop quantum gravity

hawking radiation in loop quantum gravity . a detailed study of the quantum geometry of a black hole horizon has been made using loop quantum gravity . loop-quantization reproduces the result for black hole entropy originally discovered by bekenstein and hawking . further , it led to the computation of quantum gravity corrections to the entropy and radiation of black holes . based on the fluctuations of the horizon area , a quantum black hole exhibits deviations from the hawking spectrum that would be observable were x-rays from hawking radiation of evaporating primordial black holes to be observed . the quantum effects are centered at a set of discrete and unblended frequencies highly pronounced on top of hawking radiation spectrum . planck star . in 2014 carlo rovelli and francesca vidotto proposed that there is a planck star inside every black hole . based on lqg , the theory states that as stars are collapsing into black holes , the energy density reaches the planck energy density , causing a repulsive force that creates a star . furthermore , the existence of such a star would resolve the black hole firewall and black hole information paradox . loop quantum cosmology . the popular and technical literature makes extensive references to lqg-related topic of loop quantum cosmology . lqc was mainly developed by martin bojowald , it was popularized loop quantum cosmology in scientific american for predicting a big bounce prior to the big bang . loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) is a symmetry-reduced model of classical general relativity quantized using methods that mimic those of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) that predicts a '' quantum bridge '' between contracting and expanding cosmological branches . achievements of lqc have been the resolution of the big bang singularity , the prediction of a big bounce , and a natural mechanism for inflation . lqc models share features of lqg and so is a useful toy model . however , the results obtained are subject to the usual restriction that a truncated classical theory , then quantized , might not display the true behaviour of the full theory due to artificial suppression of degrees of freedom that might have large quantum fluctuations in the full theory . it has been argued that singularity avoidance in lqc are by mechanisms only available in these restrictive models and that singularity avoidance in the full theory can still be obtained but by a more subtle feature of lqg . loop quantum gravity phenomenology . quantum gravity effects are notoriously difficult to measure because the planck length is so incredibly small . however recently physicists , such as jack palmer , have started to consider the possibility of measuring quantum gravity effects mostly from astrophysical observations and gravitational wave detectors . the energy of those fluctuations at scales this small cause space-perturbations which are visible at higher scales . background independent scattering amplitudes . loop quantum gravity is formulated in a background-independent language . no spacetime is assumed a priori , but rather it is built up by the states of theory themselves – however scattering amplitudes are derived from n -point functions ( correlation function ) and these , formulated in conventional quantum field theory , are functions of points of a background space-time . the relation between the background-independent formalism and the conventional formalism of quantum field theory on a given spacetime is far from obvious , and it is far from obvious how to recover low-energy quantities from the full background-independent theory . one would like to derive the n -point functions of the theory from the background-independent formalism , in order to compare them with the standard perturbative expansion of quantum general relativity and therefore check that loop quantum gravity yields the correct low-energy limit . a strategy for addressing this problem has been suggested ; the idea is to study the boundary amplitude , namely a path integral over a finite space-time region , seen as a function of the boundary value of the field . in conventional quantum field theory , this boundary amplitude is well–defined and codes the physical information of the theory ; it does so in quantum gravity as well , but in a fully background–independent manner . a generally covariant definition of n -point functions can then be based on the idea that the distance between physical points –arguments of the n -point function is determined by the state of the gravitational field on the boundary of the spacetime region considered . progress has been made in calculating background independent scattering amplitudes this way with the use of spin foams . this is a way to extract physical information from the theory . claims to have reproduced the correct behaviour for graviton scattering amplitudes and to have recovered classical gravity have been made . '' we have calculated newton 's law starting from a world with no space and no time . '' – carlo rovelli . gravitons , string theory , supersymmetry , extra dimensions in lqg . some quantum theories of gravity posit a spin-2 quantum field that is quantized , giving rise to gravitons . in string theory , one generally starts with quantized excitations on top of a classically fixed background . this theory is thus described as background dependent . particles like photons as well as changes in the spacetime geometry ( gravitons ) are both described as excitations on the string worldsheet . the background dependence of string theory can have important physical consequences , such as determining the number of quark generations . in contrast , loop quantum gravity , like general relativity , is manifestly background independent , eliminating the background required in string theory . loop quantum gravity , like string theory , also aims to overcome the nonrenormalizable divergences of quantum field theories . lqg never introduces a background and excitations living on this background , so lqg does not use gravitons as building blocks . instead one expects that one may recover a kind of semiclassical limit or weak field limit where something like '' gravitons '' will show up again . in contrast , gravitons play a key role in string theory where they are among the first ( massless ) level of excitations of a superstring . lqg differs from string theory in that it is formulated in 3 and 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry or kaluza-klein extra dimensions , while the latter requires both to be true . there is no experimental evidence to date that confirms string theory 's predictions of supersymmetry and kaluza–klein extra dimensions . in a 2003 paper '' a dialog on quantum gravity '' , carlo rovelli regards the fact lqg is formulated in 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry as a strength of the theory as it represents the most parsimonious explanation , consistent with current experimental results , over its rival string/m-theory . proponents of string theory will often point to the fact that , among other things , it demonstrably reproduces the established theories of general relativity and quantum field theory in the appropriate limits , which loop quantum gravity has struggled to do . in that sense string theory 's connection to established physics may be considered more reliable and less speculative , at the mathematical level . loop quantum gravity has nothing to say about the matter ( fermions ) in the universe . since lqg has been formulated in 4 dimensions ( with and without supersymmetry ) , and m-theory requires supersymmetry and 11 dimensions , a direct comparison between the two has not been possible . it is possible to extend mainstream lqg formalism to higher-dimensional supergravity , general relativity with supersymmetry and kaluza–klein extra dimensions should experimental evidence establish their existence . it would therefore be desirable to have higher-dimensional supergravity loop quantizations at one 's disposal in order to compare these approaches . in fact a series of recent papers have been published attempting just this . most recently , thiemann ( and alumni ) have made progress toward calculating black hole entropy for supergravity in higher dimensions . it will be interesting to compare these results to the corresponding super string calculations . lqg and related research programs . several research groups have attempted to combine lqg with other research programs : johannes aastrup , jesper m . grimstrup et al . research combines noncommutative geometry with canonical quantum gravity and ashtekar variables , laurent freidel , simone speziale , et al . , spinors and twistor theory with loop quantum gravity , and lee smolin et al . with verlinde entropic gravity and loop gravity . stephon alexander , antonino marciano and lee smolin have attempted to explain the origins of weak force chirality in terms of ashketar 's variables , which describe gravity as chiral , and lqg with yang–mills theory fields in four dimensions . sundance bilson-thompson , hackett et al . , has attempted to introduce the standard model via lqgs degrees of freedom as an emergent property ( by employing the idea of noiseless subsystems , a useful notion introduced in a more general situation for constrained systems by fotini markopoulou-kalamara et al . constrained mechanics and noiseless subsystems , tomasz konopka , fotini markopoulou , arxiv : gr-qc/0601028 . ) furthermore , lqg has drawn philosophical comparisons with causal dynamical triangulation and asymptotically safe gravity , and the spinfoam with group field theory and ads/cft correspondence . smolin and wen have suggested combining lqg with string-net liquid , tensors , and smolin and fotini markopoulou-kalamara quantum graphity . there is the consistent discretizations approach . also , pullin and gambini provide a framework to connect the path integral and canonical approaches to quantum gravity . they may help reconcile the spin foam and canonical loop representation approaches . recent research by chris duston and matilde marcolli introduces topology change via topspin networks . problems and comparisons with alternative approaches . some of the major unsolved problems in physics are theoretical , meaning that existing theories seem incapable of explaining a certain observed phenomenon or experimental result . the others are experimental , meaning that there is a difficulty in creating an experiment to test a proposed theory or investigate a phenomenon in greater detail . many of these problems apply to lqg , including : can quantum mechanics and general relativity be realized as a fully consistent theory ( perhaps as a quantum field theory ) ? is spacetime fundamentally continuous or discrete ? would a consistent theory involve a force mediated by a hypothetical graviton , or be a product of a discrete structure of spacetime itself ( as in loop quantum gravity ) ? are there deviations from the predictions of general relativity at very small or very large scales or in other extreme circumstances that flow from a quantum gravity theory ? the theory of lqg is one possible solution to the problem of quantum gravity , as is string theory . there are substantial differences however . for example , string theory also addresses unification , the understanding of all known forces and particles as manifestations of a single entity , by postulating extra dimensions and so-far unobserved additional particles and symmetries . contrary to this , lqg is based only on quantum theory and general relativity and its scope is limited to understanding the quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction . on the other hand , the consequences of lqg are radical , because they fundamentally change the nature of space and time and provide a tentative but detailed physical and mathematical picture of quantum spacetime . presently , no semiclassical limit recovering general relativity has been shown to exist . this means it remains unproven that lqgs description of spacetime at the planck scale has the right continuum limit ( described by general relativity with possible quantum corrections ) . specifically , the dynamics of the theory are encoded in the hamiltonian constraint , but there is no candidate hamiltonian . other technical problems include finding off-shell closure of the constraint algebra and physical inner product vector space , coupling to matter fields of quantum field theory , fate of the renormalization of the graviton in perturbation theory that lead to ultraviolet divergence beyond 2-loops ( see one-loop feynman diagram in feynman diagram ) . while there has been a proposal relating to observation of naked singularity , and doubly special relativity as a part of a program called loop quantum cosmology , there is no experimental observation for which loop quantum gravity makes a prediction not made by the standard model or general relativity ( a problem that plagues all current theories of quantum gravity ) . because of the above-mentioned lack of a semiclassical limit , lqg has not yet even reproduced the predictions made by general relativity . an alternative criticism is that general relativity may be an effective field theory , and therefore quantization ignores the fundamental degrees of freedom . esa 's integral satellite measured polarization of photons of different wavelengths and was able to place a limit in the granularity of space that is less than 10⁻⁴⁸m or 13 orders of magnitude below the planck scale .
