Stratigraphy

historical development . left catholic priest nicholas steno established the theoretical basis for stratigraphy when he introduced the law of superposition , the principle of original horizontality and the principle of lateral continuity in a 1669 work on the fossilization of organic remains in layers of sediment . the first practical large-scale application of stratigraphy was by william smith in the 1790s and early 19th century . known as the '' father of english geology '' , smith recognized the significance of strata or rock layering and the importance of fossil markers for correlating strata ; he created the first geologic map of england . other influential applications of stratigraphy in the early 19th century were by georges cuvier and alexandre brongniart , who studied the geology of the region around paris . image : quebrada de cafayate , salta ( argentina ) . jpg thumb strata in cafayate ( argentina ) . lithostratigraphy . image : geology of cyprus-chalk.jpg thumb chalk layers in cyprus , showing sedimentary layering variation in rock units , most obviously displayed as visible layering , is due to physical contrasts in rock type ( lithology ) . this variation can occur vertically as layering ( bedding ) , or laterally , and reflects changes in environments of deposition ( known as facies change ) . these variations provide a lithostratigraphy or lithologic stratigraphy of the rock unit . key concepts in stratigraphy involve understanding how certain geometric relationships between rock layers arise and what these geometries imply about their original depositional environment . the basic concept in stratigraphy , called the law of superposition , states : in an undeformed stratigraphic sequence , the oldest strata occur at the base of the sequence . chemostratigraphy studies the changes in the relative proportions of trace elements and isotopes within and between lithologic units . carbon and oxygen isotope ratios vary with time , and researchers can use those to map subtle changes that occurred in the paleoenvironment . this has led to the specialized field of isotopic stratigraphy . cyclostratigraphy documents the often cyclic changes in the relative proportions of minerals ( particularly carbonates ) , grain size , thickness of sediment layers ( varves ) and fossil diversity with time , related to seasonal or longer term changes in palaeoclimates . biostratigraphy . biostratigraphy or paleontology stratigraphy is based on fossil evidence in the rock layers . strata from widespread locations containing the same fossil fauna and flora are said to be correlatable in time . biologic stratigraphy was based on william smith 's principle of faunal succession , which predated , and was one of the first and most powerful lines of evidence for , biological evolution . it provides strong evidence for the formation ( speciation ) and extinction of species . the geologic time scale was developed during the 19th century , based on the evidence of biologic stratigraphy and faunal succession . this timescale remained a relative scale until the development of radiometric dating , which was based on an absolute time framework , leading to the development of chronostratigraphy . one important development is the vail curve , which attempts to define a global historical sea-level curve according to inferences from worldwide stratigraphic patterns . stratigraphy is also commonly used to delineate the nature and extent of hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir rocks , seals , and traps of petroleum geology . chronostratigraphy . chronostratigraphy is the branch of stratigraphy that places an absolute age , rather than a relative age on rock strata . the branch is concerned with deriving geochronology data for rock units , both directly and inferentially , so that a sequence of time-relative events that created the rocks formation can be derived . the ultimate aim of chronostratigraphy is to place dates on the sequence of deposition of all rocks within a geological region , and then to every region , and by extension to provide an entire geologic record of the earth . a gap or missing strata in the geological record of an area is called a stratigraphic hiatus . this may be the result of a halt in the deposition of sediment . alternatively , the gap may be due to removal by erosion , in which case it may be called a stratigraphic vacuity . martinsen , o . j . et al .
