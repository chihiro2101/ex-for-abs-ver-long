Robert van Gulik

life . robert van gulik was born in zutphen , the son of a medical officer in the dutch army of what was then called the dutch east indies ( modern-day indonesia ) . he was born in the netherlands , but from the age of three till twelve he lived in batavia , dutch east indies ( now jakarta ) , where he was tutored in mandarin and other languages . he went to leiden university in 1929 and obtained his phd in 1935 from utrecht university . his talents as a linguist suited him for a job in the dutch foreign service , which he joined in 1935 ; and he was then stationed in various countries , mostly in east asia ( japan and china ) . he was in tokyo when japan declared war on the netherlands in 1941 , but he , along with the rest of the allied diplomatic staff , was evacuated in 1942 . he spent most of the rest of world war ii as the secretary for the dutch mission to chiang kai-shek 's nationalist government in chongqing . while in chongqing , he married a chinese woman , shui shifang , the daughter of a qing dynasty scholar-official , and they had four children together . after the war ended , he returned to the netherlands , then went to the united states as the counsellor of the dutch embassy in washington , d.c . he returned to japan in 1949 and stayed there for the next four years . while in tokyo , he published his first two books , the translation celebrated cases of judge dee and a privately published book of erotic colored prints from the ming dynasty . later postings took him all over the world , from new delhi , kuala lumpur , and beirut ( during the 1958 civil war ) to the hague . in 1959 van gulik became correspondent of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences , he resigned in 1963 . in 1964 he became a full member , and the next year he became a foreign member . from 1965 until his death from cancer at the hague in 1967 , he was the dutch ambassador to japan . judge dee mysteries . during world war ii van gulik translated the 18th-century detective novel dee goong an into english under the title celebrated cases of judge dee ( first published in tokyo in 1949 ) . the main character of this book , judge dee , was based on the real statesman and detective di renjie , who lived in the 7th century , during the tang dynasty ( ad 600–900 ) , though in the novel itself elements of ming dynasty china ( ad 1300–1600 ) were mixed in . herbert , rosemary .
