Apprenticeship

alternative terminology . there is no global consensus on a single term and depending on the culture , country and sector , the same or very similar definitions are used to describe the terms apprenticeship , internship and trainee-ship . these last two terms seem to be preferred in the health sector – examples of this being internship ( medicine ) for physicians and trainee-ships for nurses – and anglo-saxonic countries . apprenticeship is the preferred term of the european commission and the one selected for use by the european centre for the development of vocational training , which has developed many studies on the subject . some of country adapt the practice from european country such as malaysia collaborate with germany industry to build the professional technician . types of apprenticeships . apprenticeships can be divided into two main categories : independent and cooperative . davy , n . , frakenberg , a . ( 2019 ) . typology of apprenticeships in higher vocational education . retrieved 8 may 2019 independent apprenticeships are those organized and managed by employers , without any involvement from educational institutions . they happen dissociated from any educational curricula , which means that , usually , the apprentices are not involved in any educational programme at the same time but , even if they are , there is no relation between the undergoing studies and the apprenticeship . cooperative apprenticeships are those organized and managed in cooperation between educational institutions and employers . they vary in terms of governance , some being more employer lead and others more educational institution lead , but they are always associated with a curriculum and are designed as a mean for students to put theory in practice and master knowledge in a way that empowers them with professional autonomy . their main characteristics could be summarized into the following : . history . the system of apprenticeship first developed in the late middle ages and came to be supervised by craft guilds and town governments . a master craftsman was entitled to employ young people as an inexpensive form of labour in exchange for providing food , lodging and formal training in the craft . most apprentices were males , but female apprentices were found in crafts such as seamstress , tailor , cordwainer , baker and stationer . apprentices usually began at ten to fifteen years of age , and would live in the master craftsman 's household . the contract between the craftsman , the apprentice and , generally , the apprentice 's parents would often be governed by an indenture . most apprentices aspired to becoming master craftsmen themselves on completion of their contract ( usually a term of seven years ) , but some would spend time as a journeyman and a significant proportion would never acquire their own workshop . in coventry those completing seven-year apprenticeships with stuff merchants were entitled to become freedom of the city . adrian room , '' cash , john ( 1822–1880 ) '' , oxford dictionary of national biography , oxford university press , 2004 apprenticeship was adopted into military of the west african kingdom of dahomey . soldiers in the army were recruited as young as seven or eight years old , as they initially served as shield carriers for regular soldiers . after years of apprenticeship and military experience , the recruits were allowed to join the army as regular soldiers . with a combination of lifelong military experience and monetary incentives , a cohesive and well-disciplined military emerged in the kingdom of dahomey . . apprenticeship systems worldwide . australia . australian apprenticeships encompass all apprenticeships and traineeships . they cover all industry sectors in australia and are used to achieve both 'entry-level ' and career 'upskilling ' objectives . there were 475,000 australian apprentices in-training as at 31 march 2012 , an increase of 2.4 % from the previous year . australian government employer and employee incentives may be applicable , while state and territory governments may provide public funding support for the training element of the initiative . australian apprenticeships combine time at work with formal training and can be full-time , part-time or school-based . australian apprentice and traineeship services are dedicated to promoting retention , therefore much effort is made to match applicants with the right apprenticeship or traineeship . this is done with the aid of aptitude tests , tips , and information on 'how to retain an apprentice or apprenticeship' . information and resources on potential apprenticeship and traineeship occupations are available in over sixty industries . the distinction between the terms apprentices and trainees lies mainly around traditional trades and the time it takes to gain a qualification . the australian government uses australian apprenticeships centres to administer and facilitate australian apprenticeships so that funding can be disseminated to eligible businesses and apprentices and trainees and to support the whole process as it underpins the future skills of australian industry . australia also has a fairly unusual safety net in place for businesses and australian apprentices with its group training scheme . this is where businesses that are not able to employ the australian apprentice for the full period until they qualify , are able to lease or hire the australian apprentice from a group training organisation . it is a safety net , because the group training organisation is the employer and provides continuity of employment and training for the australian apprentice . in addition to a safety net , group training organisations ( gto ) have other benefits such as additional support for both the host employer and the trainee/apprentice through an industry consultant who visits regularly to make sure that the trainee/apprentice are fulfilling their work and training obligations with their host employer . there is the additional benefit of the trainee/apprentice being employed by the gto reducing the payroll/superannuation and other legislative requirements on the host employer who pays as invoiced per agreement . austria . apprenticeship training in austria is organized in a school system with long firm trainig parts . so it is possible to get the matura needed to enter university . wifi wifi company-based training of apprentices is

cook ( 1,600 / year ) . there are many smaller trades with small numbers of apprentices , like '' edv-systemtechniker '' ( sysadmin ) which is completed by fewer than 100 people a year . the apprenticeship leave certificate provides the apprentice with access to two different vocational careers . on the one hand , it is a prerequisite for the admission to the master craftsman exam and for qualification tests , and on the other hand it gives access to higher education via the tve-exam or the higher education entrance exam which are prerequisites for taking up studies at colleges , universities , '' fachhochschulen '' , post-secondary courses and post-secondary colleges . the person responsible for overseeing the training inside the company is called '' lehrherr '' or '' ausbilder '' . an ausbilder must prove that he has the professional qualifications needed to educate another person , has no criminal record and is an otherwise-respectable person . the law states that '' the person wanting to educate a young apprentice must prove that he has an ethical way of living and the civic qualities of a good citizen '' . antrag auf anerkennung als lehrherr und

certificate of proficiency '' . some crafts , such as electrician , are educated in lengths of 3 and 4 years . in this case , an electrician with 4 years apprenticeship gets more theoretical background than one with 3 years apprenticeship . also , but that is easily lost in translation , the profession has a different name . each of the over 300 nationwide defined vocational profiles has defined framework – conditions as length of education , theoretical and practical learning goals and certification conditions . age of the apprentices . typically an apprenticeship is started at age of 15 and 18 after finishing general education . some apprenticeships have a recommend or required age of 18 , which obviously leads to a higher average age . there is formally no maximum age , however , for persons above 21 it is hard to find a company due to companies preferring younger ages due to the lower cost of labour . canada . in canada , apprenticeships tend to be formalized for craft trades and technician level qualifications . at the completion of the provincial exam , they may write the provincial standard exam . british columbia is one province that uses these exams as the provincial exam . this means a qualification for the province will satisfy the whole country . the inter-provincial exam questions are agreed upon by all provinces of the time . at the time there were only four ( 4 ) provinces , nova scotia , new brunswick , canada east ( now ontario ) , and canada west ( now quebec ) . in canada , each province has its own apprenticeship program , which may be the only route into jobs within compulsory trades . organisations such as the canadian council of directors of apprenticeship and ontario college of trades help to oversee the programmes . france .

minister dominique de villepin , announced a new law . dubbed '' law on equality of chances '' , it created the first employment contract as well as manual apprenticeship from as early as 14 years of

1–4 years . as of 2015 , more than 30,000 apprentices are being trained in 2,751 industries in 276 trades across pakistan . this figure constitutes less than 10 % of institution based vocational training i.e . more than 350 thousand annually . recently , government of pakistan through national vocational & technical training commission ( navttc ) has initiated to reform existing system of

apprentice , i.e . , the '' çırak '' in turkish . the second level is pre-master which is called , '' kalfa '' in turkish . the mastery level is called as '' usta '' and is the highest level of achievement . an 'usta ' is eligible to take in and accept new 'ciraks ' to train and bring them up . the training process usually starts when the small boy is of age 10–11 and becomes a full-grown master at the age of 20–25 . many years of hard work and disciplining under the authority of the master is the key to the young apprentice 's education and learning process . in turkey today there are

apprenticeship programs in the united states are regulated by the smith–hughes act ( 1917 ) , the national industrial recovery act ( 1933 ) , and national apprenticeship act , also known as the '' fitzgerald act . '' the number of american apprentices has increased from 375,000 in 2014 to 500,000 in 2016 , while the federal government intends to see 750,000 by 2019 , particularly by expanding the apprenticeship model to include white-collar worker such as information technology . . analogues at universities and professional development . the modern concept of an internship is similar to an apprenticeship but not as rigorous . universities still use apprenticeship schemes in their production of scholars : bachelors are promoted to masters and then produce a thesis under the oversight of a supervisor before the corporate body of the university recognises the achievement of the standard of a doctorate . another view of this system is of graduate students in the role of apprentices , post-doctoral fellows as journeyman , and professors as masters . in the '' wealth of nations '' adam smith states that : seven years seem anciently to have been , all over europe , the usual term established for the duration of apprenticeships in the greater part of incorporated trades . all such incorporations were anciently called universities , which indeed is the proper latin name for any incorporation whatever . the university of smiths , the university of tailors , etc . , are expressions which we commonly meet with in the old charters of ancient towns . as to have wrought seven years under a master properly qualified was necessary in order to entitle any person to become a master , and to have himself apprenticed in a common trade ; so to have studied seven years under a master properly qualified was necessary to entitle him to become a master , teacher , or doctor ( words anciently synonymous ) in the liberal arts , and to have scholars or apprentices ( words likewise originally synonymous ) to study under him . also similar to apprenticeships are the professional development arrangements for new graduates in the professions of accountancy , engineering , management consulting , and the law . a british example was training contracts known as 'articled clerk ' . the learning curve in modern professional service firms , such as law firms , consultancies or accountancies , generally resembles the traditional master-apprentice model : the newcomer to the firm is assigned to one or several more experienced colleagues ( ideally partners in the firm ) and learns his skills on the job . see also .
