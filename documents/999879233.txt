Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra

history . the concertgebouw opened on 11 april 1888 . the concertgebouw orchestra was established several months later and gave its first concert in the concertgebouw on 3 november 1888 . this performance was conducted by the orchestra 's first chief conductor , willem kes . 1888–1945 : kes and mengelberg . kes served as the orchestra 's chief conductor from its 1888 founding to 1895 . in 1895 , willem mengelberg became chief conductor and remained in this position for fifty years , an unusually long tenure for a music director . other long tenures at major orchestras include evgeny mravinsky at the leningrad philharmonic orchestra , ernest ansermet at the orchestre de la suisse romande , robert kajanus at the helsinki philharmonic orchestra , and eugene ormandy at the philadelphia orchestra . he is generally regarded as having brought the orchestra to a level of major international significance , with a particular championing of such then-contemporary composers as gustav mahler and richard strauss . for approximately its first 75 years , the concertgebouw orchestra had a somewhat complicated roster of conductors . in addition to the chief conductor , the orchestra had conductor positions titled '' eerste dirigent '' ( '' first conductor '' ) , who assisted the chief conductor with programming , and '' tweede dirigent '' ( '' second conductor '' ) , who did '' what he was told . '' wisse , kees , notes to q-disc issue '' eduard van beinum : the radio recordings '' , q-disc ( translated lodewijk odé , ko kooman and chris gordon ) . during mengelberg 's time as chief conductor , several of these first conductors included karl muck ( 1921–1925 ) , pierre monteux ( 1924–1934 ) , bruno walter ( 1934–1939 ) , and eugen jochum ( 1941–1943 ) , each of them internationally respected and holding positions at other orchestras as well . musicians who served as '' second conductor '' were all dutch and included the composer cornelis dopper , evert cornelis and eduard van beinum . in 1945 , because of the controversy over his relationship with the nazi occupying forces during the german occupation of the netherlands during world war ii , mengelberg was removed as chief conductor and subsequently banned from conducting in the netherlands . the ban was initially imposed for the remainder of his life , but after an appeal , reduced to six years , applied retroactively from 1945 . mengelberg died in 1951 just before the end of his sentence , thus never conducting the orchestra after 1945 . 1945–1988 : van beinum and haitink . from 1945 to 1959 , the orchestra 's principal conductor was eduard van beinum , who had debuted with the orchestra in 1929 . he had become the second conductor of the orchestra in 1931 , and co-principal conductor in 1938 . one of his specialties was the symphonies of anton bruckner , and van beinum made commercial recordings with the orchestra of bruckner 's eighth and ninth symphonies for the philips records label . van beinum served as sole chief conductor of the orchestra after world war ii until his sudden death on the concertgebouw podium from a heart attack in april 1959 . bernard haitink made his debut with the concertgebouw orchestra on 7 november 1956 . after van beinum 's death , from 1961 to 1963 , haitink and eugen jochum shared the post of chief conductor of the orchestra . dyneley hussey , '' the musician 's gramophone '' ( may 1960 ) . the musical times , 101 ( 1407 ) : 303 . haitink became sole chief conductor in 1963 , and served in this post until 1988 . at some point during haitink 's time , the conductor system was simplified to have an assistant conductor instead of first- and second-conductors . conductors who served in this capacity included edo de waart and hans vonk . the recording profile of the orchestra increased most dramatically under haitink , with many recordings for philips records , as well as emi and columbia records . in the early 1980s , the dutch government threatened the orchestra with reductions in its government subsidy that could potentially have led to the dismissal of 23 musicians from the orchestra . haitink threatened to resign in protest , and the financial situation was eventually settled . in 1999 , haitink was named the orchestra 's conductor laureate . in march 2014 , haitink suggested to the dutch newspaper het parool that he wished to renounce the title of rco conductor laureate and no longer to guest-conduct the orchestra , in protest at the orchestra 's current administrative management . in september 2015 , the orchestra announced a rapprochement with haitink , with a scheduled guest-conducting engagement with the rco in the 2016–2017 season . . 1988–current : chailly , jansons and gatti . riccardo chailly made his debut with the concertgebouw orchestra in 1985 , and was elected that year as their next chief conductor to succeed haitink . as the first non-dutchman to hold the post , chailly served as chief conductor from 1988 to 2004 . his recordings with the orchestra include complete mahler and brahms symphony cycles and several bruckner symphonies . he is a strong advocate of modern music and recorded shorter works of shostakovich , the complete kammermusiken of paul hindemith , and the orchestral works of igor stravinsky , olivier messiaen and edgard varèse . after his departure in 2004 , chailly was named conductor emeritus of the rco . the latvian conductor mariss jansons made his rco debut in 1988 and was elected chief conductor on 22 october 2002 . his tenure officially began on 1 september 2004 , with an initial contract of three years . premières during janson 's tenure have included hans werner henze 's sebastian im traum , a rco co-commission . in april 2014 , the orchestra announced the scheduled conclusion of jansons ' tenure as chief conductor after the 2014–15 season . daniele gatti first guest-conducted the rco in 2004 . in october 2014 , the rco announced the appointment of gatti as its seventh chief conductor , effective in 2016 . on 2 august 2018 , the orchestra announced gatti 's immediate departure following complaints of '' inappropriate '' behaviour with female musicians . in october 2020 , the rco announced the appointment of iván fischer as its honorary guest conductor ( honorair gastdirigent ) , effective with the 2021-2022 season . . character . the orchestra enjoyed a close relationship with gustav mahler and championed many of his symphonies , with an especially worthy festival of his music being the 1920 mahler festival . other conductors who worked closely with the concertgebouw orchestra included pierre monteux , eugen jochum , george szell and kirill kondrashin , who was principal guest conductor from 1978 , following his defection from the ussr , until his death in 1981 . more recently , nikolaus harnoncourt served as honorary guest conductor of the rco , beginning in 2000 , and leading his final performance with the rco in october 2013 . another factor in creating the orchestra 's distinct character is that the concertgebouw orchestra has had only six chief conductors , setting it apart from orchestras of similar age and caliber . the nearly one thousand recordings that the orchestra has to its credit have also contributed to this reputation . the orchestra also serves as one of the opera orchestras for productions of the dutch national opera . jan raes is the orchestra 's current executive director , since 1 december 2008 , succeeding jan willem loot , who retired in november 2008 . in may 2019 , the orchestra announced that raes is to stand down as its executive director at the end of 2019 . past artistic directors of the concertgebouw orchestra have included rudolf mengelberg ( 1925-1955 ) , marius flothuis ( 1955–1974 ) , hein van royen ( 1974-1991 ) and peter ruzicka . the most recent head of artistic administration for the orchestra is joel ethan fried . dominik winterling and ulrike niehoff will be joining the concertgebouworkest ’ s managing board as from the first quarter of 2021 . together with david bazen , the current interim managing director , they will form a three-member managing board . ms ulrike niehoff has joined the managing board as artistic director in january 2021 . mr dominik winterling will serve as chairman of the concertgebouworkest ’ s managing board , a post he will assume by 1 march 2021 at the latest . the rco has begun to issue cds on its own label , rco live , as conducted by jansons and haitink among others . . chief conductors . willem kes (
