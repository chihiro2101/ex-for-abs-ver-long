'' after years of seclusion , she emerged as a celebrity , speaking at college campuses across the country and appearing in photographic essays in life and look magazines . moore became a member of the american academy of arts and letters in 1955 . she was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1962 . moore continued to publish poems in various magazines , including , the nation , the new republic , partisan review , and the new yorker , as well as publishing various books and collections of her poetry and criticism . she moved to 35 west ninth street in manhattan in 1965 . after she moved back to greenwich village , she was widely recognized around town for her tricorn hat and black cape . she liked athletics and was a great admirer of muhammad ali , for whose spoken-word album i am the greatest ! she wrote the liner notes . she became known as a baseball fan , first of the brooklyn dodgers and then of the new york yankees . she threw out the ball to open the season at yankee stadium in 1968 . moore suffered a series of strokes in her last years . she died in 1972 , and her ashes were interred with those of her mother at the family 's burial plot at the evergreen cemetery in gettysburg , pennsylvania . by the time of her death , she had received many honorary degrees and virtually every honor available to an american poet . the new york times printed a full-page obituary . in 1996 , she was inducted into the st . louis walk of fame . moore corresponded with ezra pound from 1918 , and visited him regularly during his incarceration at st . elizabeth 's . she opposed benito mussolini and fascism from the start , and objected to pound 's antisemitism . moore was a republican and supported herbert hoover in 1928 and 1932 . she was a lifelong ally and friend of the american poet wallace stevens , as demonstrated in her review of stevens 's first collection , harmonium , and , in particular , by her comment about the influence of henri rousseau on the poem '' floral decorations for bananas '' . she also corresponded , from 1943 to 1961 , with the reclusive collage artist joseph cornell , whose methods of collecting and appropriation were much like her own . in 1955 , moore was invited informally by david wallace , manager of marketing research for ford 's '' e-car '' project , and his co-worker bob young , to suggest a name for the car . wallace 's rationale was '' who better to understand the nature of words than a poet ? '' in october 1955 , moore was approached to submit '' inspirational names '' for the e-car , and on november 7 , she offered her list of names , which included such notables as '' resilient bullet '' , '' ford silver sword '' , '' mongoose civique '' , '' varsity stroke '' , '' pastelogram '' , and '' andante con moto '' . on december 8 , she submitted her last and most famous name , '' utopian turtletop '' . the e-car was christened by ford as the edsel . her experience was memorably recounted in her epistolic article for the new yorker of april 13 , 1957 , titled '' correspondence with david wallace '' . it is anthologized in mordechai richler 's the best of modern humour , knopf , 1983 , pp 66-73 . she notes in her preface , '' these letters should correct the impression persistent among inquirers , that i succeeded in finding for the new products division . a name for the new car i had been recruited to name ; whereas i did not give the car the name it now has .

'' moore went on a trip to new york city in 1909 with another bryn mawr student , where she heard a lecture by the colorado suffragist judge ben lindsey , went to a suffrage mass meeting , and saw j . m . barrie 's classic suffragist-themed play what every woman knows . there is speculation that moore also participated in the women 's suffrage parade of 1913 in washington , d.c . , one day before woodrow wilson 's presidential inauguration . although in her personal letters she told her brother , warner , that she did not participate in the parade after he cautioned her about the possible dangers she would face from the opponents of the parade , '' her scrapbook includes programs and newspaper clippings about the march '' , and she later told the poet elizabeth bishop that she '' paraded with the suffragettes , led by inez milholland on her white horse '' . moore was never as public about her involvement in the suffrage movement after that parade in 1913 , because afterward she began participating anonymously , mostly through writing , using a pseudonym . during her stay in carlisle , pennsylvania , she admitted years later , she '' wrote suffrage pieces for the carlisle newspaper '' , which at the time appeared to be authored anonymously . dr . mary chapman ( university of british columbia ) argues that moore was the writer of suffragist writings of the time in carlisle news publications and that could be analyzed by examining her specific writing style alongside suffragist prose and poetry that were published in the carlisle evening herald in 1915 : '' many of the prosuffrage articles that appeared in the herald exhibit moore 's characteristic reliance on quotation . '' additionally , a letter appealing for the women 's suffrage movement in the carlisle evening sentinel is signed '' miss m.m . '' , which scholars believe could stand for marianne moore because '' the absence of any other documented unmarried female suffragists in the carlisle area with the initials m.m . make it likely that the sentinel reader who coyly constructs a letter to the editor almost entirely from quotation is marianne moore '' . moore 's poem '' silence '' ( 1924 ) also resembles the writing style that was seen in the sentinel letter . moore established herself on the surface as a modernist poet , and the common practice within the modernist circle of poets was to not engage with the politics of the time ; but her writings displayed a '' sophisticated political subtext '' . . selected works . poems , 1921 ( published in london by h.d . and bryher . moore disapproved of the timing , editing , selections , and format of this collection . see the selected letters of marianne moore , ed . bonnie costello et al .
