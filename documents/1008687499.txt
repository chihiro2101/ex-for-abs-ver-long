Black Watch

source of the name . the source of the regiment 's name is uncertain . in 1725 , following the jacobite rising of 1715 , general george wade was authorised by george i to form six '' watch '' companies to patrol the highlands of scotland , three from clan campbell , one from clan fraser of lovat , one from clan munro and one from clan grant . these were to be '' employed in disarming the highlanders , preventing depredations , bringing criminals to justice , and hindering rebels and attainted persons from inhabiting that part of the kingdom . '' the force was known in gaelic as am freiceadan dubh , '' the dark '' or '' black watch '' . simpson , p . 114–115 this epithet may have come from the uniform plaids of dark tartan with which the companies were provided . other theories have been put forward ; for instance , that the name referred to the '' black hearts '' of the pro-government militia who had sided with the '' enemies of true highland spirit '' , parker , p . 13–14 or that it came from their original duty in policing the highlands , namely preventing '' blackmail '' ( highlanders demanding extortion payments to spare
