'' this loose confederation is made up of the ojibwe , odawa and potawatomi tribes . the north channel was part of the route used by the french colonial voyageurs and coureurs des bois to reach lake superior . the first known european to settle on the island was father joseph poncet , a france jesuit , who set up a mission near wiikwemkoong in 1648 . the jesuits called the island '' isle de ste-marie '' . the endemic eurasian infectious diseases carried by the visitors had a devastating effect on the island 's population , as most natives had no natural immunity to the new diseases . they suffered so many deaths in the ensuing epidemics of smallpox , measles and other diseases , that their societies were disrupted . in addition , the five nations of the iroquois began raiding the island and area to try to control the fur trade with the french . as part of what was called the beaver wars , the iroquois drove the anishinaabe people from the island by 1650 . according to anishinaabe oral tradition , to purify the island from disease , the people burned their settlements as they left . the island was mostly uninhabited for nearly 150 years . native people ( odawa , ojibwe , potawatomi ) began to return to the island following the war of 1812 between britain and the united states . they ceded the island to the british crown in 1836 ; the government set aside the land as a refuge for natives . in 1838 jean-baptiste proulx re-established a roman catholic mission . the jesuits took over the mission in 1845 . in 1862 , the government opened up the island to settlement by non-native people by the manitoulin island treaty . as the wikwemikong chief did not accept this treaty , his people 's reserve was held back from being offered for development . that reserve remains unceded . on august 7 , 1975 the wikwemikong unceded indian reserve reasserted their claim to sovereignty over the islands off the east end of manitoulin island , declaring , '' wikwemikong band has jurisdiction over its reservation lands and surrounding waters .
