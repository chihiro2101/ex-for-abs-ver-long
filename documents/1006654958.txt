and two counties , westchester and putnam . originally surrounded by farming families , the bloomer and palmer families lived on the west side , the ryder family lived on the north side , and to the east is the vail family . prior to 1731 , the eastern edge of the bloomer farm was the border of connecticut . the area from there to the current state border was given to new york as part of the oblong , equivalency or connecticut 's panhandle agreement . the area was a strong dairy community from the 1850s through 1915 , when the borden condensed milk factory was in production in brewster , new york . by 1915 , the factory closed after new york city condemned much of the property along the rivers and lakes in the area to protect the water quality flowing into the newly created croton reservoir system . the bloomer family , originally from rye , new york , started farming the property on the west side of the lake prior to 1760 . in 1762 they purchased the land and built , along with the palmer family , the peach lake meeting house ( quaker meeting house ) at the southeast corner of the lake . this peach lake meeting house , like many others , starting at long island sound and heading north , was built in the disputed area between the connecticut and new york colonies called the oblong . the vails family ran the dairy farm on the east side of the lake . the ryder family , who have for generations controlled the putnam county national bank , have farmed land on the northern end of peach lake since the 18th century . north salem was part of the tribal land of a wappinger band known as the kitawonks ( or kitchawanks ) , who laid claim to all the lands bordering the kitchewan or croton river that separates north salem from present-day somers . the name of peach lake was unusual as there were no peach orchards in the surrounding area . during 1600 and 1700s the lake was called lake pehquenakonck . dutch documents , such as van der donck â€™ s 1656 history of new netherland , mention the area . other maps from dutch archives , circa 1685 , show the '' indian tribes of the new world '' and locations of indian villages , include lake pehquenakonck . the area was later named as peach pond , derived from the indian word pech-quen . by the mid-1800s , the name was changed again to peach lake . the local elementary school is called pequenakonck ( pronounced pee-kwon-a-konk ) , and the country club at bloomerside cooperative is called pehquenakonck country club . there are four large residential communities around peach lake . there are three cooperatives : bloomerside and vails after the original farming families , pietsch gardens cooperative originally owned by the pietsch family ( purchased in 1926 from the teagarden family ) and northern westchester country club ( aka hotel property ) formerly owned by the palmer family in the early 19th century . these four communities comprise approximately 460 homes which started as summer homes and communities about 1914 . from 2011-2015 vails grove , a 9 hole municipal golf course in peach lake was the host of the rumham invitational . geography . peach lake is located at ( 41.363521

north salem and southeast . the lake is long , wide at its center , and reaches a maximum depth of about . its western side is deeper than the eastern , unequally scalloped by glacial gouging . a sharp thermocline is present at a depth of about where the water temperature may change within an inch . this thermocline protects the lake from excessive weed growth in areas of the lake that are deeper than the thermocline layer as it is simply too cold for the weeds to start growing . this temperature gradient is caused by the natural springs that feed the lake . there are no rivers entering the lake and only a very small intermittent stream on the southeastern corner . the lake is a class b reservoir for the new york city water supply system and , unusually for the area , outflows north , into the east branch reservoir in the town of southeast , which is part of the croton reservoir system . demographics . as of the census of 2000 , there were 1,671 people , 617 households , and 468
