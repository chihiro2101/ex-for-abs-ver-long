early work . left lee lawrie was born in rixdorf , germany , in 1877 and immigrated to the united states in 1882 as a young child with his family ; they settled in chicago . it was there , at the age of 14 , that he began working for the sculptor richard henry park . at the age of 15 , in 1892 lawrie worked as an assistant to many of the sculptors in chicago , for their part in constructing the '' white city '' for the world 's columbian exposition . following the completion of that work , lawrie went east , where he became an assistant to william ordway partridge . during the next decade , he worked with other established sculptors : augustus saint-gaudens , philip martiny , alexander phimister proctor , john william kitson and others . his work at the louisiana purchase exposition , under karl bitter , the foremost architectural sculptor of the time , allowed lawrie to develop both his skills and his reputation as an architectural sculptor . lawrie received a bachelor 's degree in fine arts from yale university in 1910 . he was an instructor in yale 's school of fine arts from 1908 to 1919 and taught in the architecture program at harvard university from 1910 to 1912 . civic art : a centennial history of the u.s . commission of fine arts . collaborations with cram and goodhue . lawrie 's collaborations with ralph adams cram and bertram goodhue brought him to the forefront of architectural sculptors in the united states . after the breakup of the cram , goodhue firm in 1914 , lawrie continued to work with goodhue until the architect died in 1924 . he next worked with goodhue 's successors . lawrie sculpted numerous bas reliefs for el fureidis , an estate in montecito , california designed by goodhue . the bas reliefs depict the arthurian legends and remain intact at the estate today . the nebraska state capitol and the los angeles public library both feature extensive sculptural programs integrated with the surface , massing , spatial grammar , and social function of the building . lawrie 's collaborations with goodhue are arguably the most highly developed example of architectural sculpture in american architectural history . lawrie served as a consultant to the 1933-34 century of progress international exposition in chicago . he was a member of the national institute of arts and letters , the american academy of arts and letters , the national academy of design , and the architectural league of new york . among his many awards was the aia gold medal of the american institute of architects in 1921 and 1927 , a medal of honor from the architectural league of new york in 1931 , and an honorary degree from yale university . he served on the u.s . commission of fine arts in washington , dc from 1933 to 1937 and again from 1945 to 1950 ; it oversees federal public works and artwork in the city . thomas e . luebke , ed . , civic art : a centennial history of the u.s . commission of fine arts ( washington , d.c . : u.s . commission of fine arts , 2013 ) : appendix b , p . 548 . . commissions related to goodhue . image : sculpture at the entrance to rockefeller chapel uofchicago.jpg right upright 1 thumb lawrie 's work at rockefeller chapel , university of chicago , circa 1929 marble reliefs above the windows of the deborah cook sayles public library , pawtucket , rhode island , 1902 ( cram , goodhue & ferguson ) chapel at west point , west point , new york ( cram and goodhue ) church of st . vincent ferrer , new york city ( cram and goodhue ) pulpit and lectern and apse carvings at st . bartholomew 's episcopal church , ( cram and goodhue ) reredos at saint thomas church on fifth avenue in new york city ( cram and goodhue ) reredos at st . john 's episcopal church ( west hartford , connecticut ) ( goodhue ) nebraska state capitol , lincoln , nebraska ( goodhue ) los angeles public library , los angeles , california ( goodhue ) trinity english lutheran church , fort wayne , indiana ( goodhue ) national academy of sciences building in washington , d.c .
