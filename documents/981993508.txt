'' his career was not exactly that of a star , but he was loved both by his orchestra players and audiences . as music director in wiesbaden ( 1920-1944 ) he arranged the first german '' gustav mahler-festival '' in april 1921 , conducting mahler 's symphonies nos . 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and '' das lied von der erde '' ( cf . signale für die musikalische welt , no . 14 , 6 april 1921 , p . & nbsp ; 384 ) ; and a week later the berlin philharmonic invited him to berlin , where he conducted mahler 's sixth symphony on may 2 , 1921 . mahler 's works were very popular in germany , holland and austria during the 1920s , but were eventually banned under the nazis between 1933 and 1945 owing to the composer 's jewish origin . obituary for carl schuricht , musical times , 108 ( 1489 ) , p . 252 ( 1967 ) hugo leichtentritt , '' musical notes from abroad : germany '' . musical times , 74 ( 1086 ) , p . 747 ( 1933 ) . schuricht continued to conduct mahler outside germany . on october 5 , 1939 , during the so-called phony war , his conducting with the amsterdam concertgebouw orchestra of mahler 's das lied von der erde was disrupted by a woman heckler who called out '' deutschland über alles , herr schuricht !
