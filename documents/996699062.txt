Otto Klemperer

early life . otto klemperer was born in breslau , province of silesia , in what was then the german empire state of prussia ; the city is now wrocław , poland . his father nathan klemperer was originally from josefov , the jewish ghetto in the bohemia city of prague ( now in the czech republic ) . his mother was a sephardi jews from hamburg . otto klemperer studied music first at the hoch conservatory in frankfurt , and later at the stern conservatory in berlin under james kwast and hans pfitzner . he followed kwast to three institutions and credited him with the whole basis of his musical development . in 1905 , he met gustav mahler while conducting the off-stage brass at a performance of mahler 's symphony no . 2 ( mahler ) . he also made a piano arrangement of the second symphony . opera . feb 1961 , p 89 klemperer got the opportunity to present this work to mahler in february 1907 , on the occasion of the first of three trips to vienna with jacques van lier . mahler and klemperer became friends , and klemperer became conductor at the german opera in prague in 1907 on mahler 's recommendation . mahler wrote a short testimonial , recommending klemperer , on a small card which klemperer kept for the rest of his life . later , in 1910 , klemperer assisted mahler in the premiere of his symphony no . 8 ( mahler ) . music career . klemperer went on to hold a number of positions , in hamburg ( 1910–1912 ) ; in barmen ( 1912–1913 ) ; the strasbourg opera ( 1914–1917 ) ; the cologne opera ( 1917–1924 ) ; and the wiesbaden opera house ( 1924–1927 ) . from 1927 to 1931 , he was conductor at the kroll opera in berlin . in this post he enhanced his reputation as a champion of new music , playing a number of new works , including janáček 's from the house of the dead , schoenberg 's erwartung , stravinsky 's oedipus rex , and hindemith 's cardillac . 1930s move to united states . when the nazi party gained power in 1933 , klemperer left germany shortly afterwards , first to austria then to switzerland . he had previously converted to catholicism , but returned to judaism at the end of his life . in 1935 , he migrated to the united states , residing in california after being appointed music director of the los angeles philharmonic . while in los angeles , he began to concentrate more on the standard works of the germanic repertoire that would later bring his greatest acclaim , particularly the works of beethoven , brahms and gustav mahler , though he gave the los angeles premieres of some of fellow los angeles resident arnold schoenberg 's works with the philharmonic . he also visited other countries , including the united kingdom and australia . while the orchestra responded well to his leadership , klemperer had a difficult time adjusting to life and climate in southern california , a situation exacerbated by repeated manic-depressive episodes , reportedly as a result of severe cyclothymic bipolar disorder . he also found that the dominant musical culture and leading music critics in the united states were largely unsympathetic to modern music from weimar 's golden age , and he felt both the music and his support of it were not properly appreciated . joseph horowitz , review , the american scholar , spring 1997 ( v.66 , pp . 307-10 ) klemperer hoped for a permanent position as principal conductor in new york or philadelphia , but in 1936 he was passed over for both first in philadelphia , where eugene ormandy succeeded leopold stokowski at the philadelphia orchestra , and then in new york , where arturo toscanini 's departure left a vacancy at the new york philharmonic but john barbirolli and artur rodziński were engaged in preference to klemperer . the new york decision was particularly galling , as klemperer had been engaged to conduct the first fourteen weeks of the new york philharmonic 's 1935-6 season , and toscanini himself had suggested klemperer as a possible replacement . klemperer 's bitterness at this decision was voiced in a letter he wrote to the philharmonic 's manager , arthur judson : '' that the society did not reengage me is the strongest offense , the sharpest insult to me as artist , which i can imagine . you see , i am no youngster . i have a name and a good name . one could not use me in a most difficult season and then expell me . this non-reengagement will have very bad results not only for me in new york but in the whole world . this non-reengagement is an absolutely unjustified wrong done to me by the philharmonic society . '' peter heyworth , otto klemperer : his life and times , cambridge up , vols 1 and 2 ; 1996 ; . then , after completing the 1939 los angeles philharmonic summer season at the hollywood bowl , klemperer was visiting boston and was diagnosed with a brain tumor ; the subsequent surgery to remove '' a tumour the size of a small orange '' left him partially paralyzed . he went into a deep depression and was placed in an institution from which he escaped . the new york times ran a cover story declaring him missing , and after he was found in new jersey , a humiliating photo of him behind bars was printed in the herald tribune . though he would occasionally conduct the philharmonic after that , he lost the post of music director . furthermore , his erratic behavior during manic episodes made him an undesirable guest conductor of us orchestras , and the late flowering of his career centered in other countries . in 1940 , klemperer became a us citizen . after world war ii , klemperer helped found the music academy of the west summer conservatory in santa barbara , before he returned to europe to work at the budapest opera ( 1947–1950 ) . finding communist rule in hungary increasingly irksome , he became an itinerant conductor , guest conducting the royal danish orchestra , montreal symphony orchestra , wdr symphony orchestra cologne , concertgebouw orchestra , and the philharmonia of london . the early 1950s . in the early 1950s , klemperer experienced difficulties arising from his us citizenship . american union policies made it difficult for him to record in europe , while his left-wing views made him increasingly unpopular with the state department and fbi . in 1952 , the us refused to renew his passport ; in 1954 , klemperer returned to europe and acquired a german passport . peter heyworth , otto klemperer : his life and times , cambridge up , vols 1 and 2 ; 1996 ; . recording for emi/hmv . klemperer 's career was revitalized in 1954 by walter legge , the london-based record producer and founder/manager of the philharmonia orchestra . legge engaged klemperer to conduct the philharmonia in performances of music by beethoven ( the complete symphonies cycle , some symphonies recorded several times ) , brahms ( complete symphonies et al . ) and much more repertoire for emi records . klemperer became the first principal conductor of the philharmonia orchestra in 1959 . he settled in switzerland at this time . he also appeared at the royal opera house covent garden , sometimes stage-directing as well as conducting , as in a 1963 production of richard wagner 's lohengrin . klemperer also conducted mozart 's die zauberflöte there in 1962 . a severe fall during a visit to montreal in 1951 forced klemperer to conduct seated in a chair . a severe burn , which resulted from his smoking in bed and trying to douse the flames with the contents of a bottle of alcohol , further paralyzed him . through klemperer 's health issues , the tireless and unwavering support and assistance of his daughter lotte , were crucial to his success . . final years . one of his last concert tours was to jerusalem , a couple of years after the six-day war , at which time he was awarded an israeli honorary passport . klemperer had performed in israel before it became a state , and returned to jerusalem only in 1970 to conduct the israeli broadcasting authority symphonic orchestra in two concerts , performing the six brandenburg concertos of bach , and mozart 's symphonies 39 , 40 and 41 . during this tour he took israeli citizenship . he retired from conducting in 1971 . klemperer died in zürich , switzerland , in 1973 , aged 88 , and was buried at zürich 's jewish cemetery oberer friesenberg , owned and provided for by the jewish religious community of zurich . he was an honorary member ( honram ) of the royal academy of music . composer . klemperer is less well known as a composer , but like other famous conductors such as furtwängler , walter and markevitch , he wrote a number of pieces , including six symphony ( only the first two were published ) , a mass , nine string quartets , many lieder and the opera das ziel . he tried periodically to have his music performed , as he had hopes of being remembered as a composer as well as a conductor , but found little success . his works have generally fallen into neglect since his death , although commercial recordings of a few of his symphonic pieces have been issued . four of his string quartets and a selection of piano pieces and songs have been recorded in two limited edition cds . cds catalogue numbers maca001 and ok2b001 . klemperer 's recordings . many listeners associate klemperer with slow tempos , but recorded evidence shows that in earlier years his tempi could be quite a bit faster . for example , one of klemperer 's most noted performances was of beethoven 's symphony no . 3 , eroica . eric grunin 's eroica project contains tempo data on 363 recordings of the work from 1924–2007 , and includes 10 by klemperer & ndash ; some recorded in the studio , most from broadcasts of live concerts . the earliest klemperer performance on tape was recorded in concert in cologne in 1954 ( when he was 69 years old ) ; the last was in london with the new philharmonia orchestra in 1970 ( when he was 85 ) . the passing years show a clear trend with respect to tempo : as klemperer aged , he took slower tempi . in 1954 , his first movement lasts 15:18 from beginning to end ; in 1970 it lasts 18:41 . in 1954 the main tempo of the first movement was about 135 beats per minute , in 1970 it had slowed to about 110 beats per minute . in 1954 , the eroica second movement , '' funeral march '' , had a timing of 14:35 ; in 1970 , it had slowed to 18:51 . similar slowings took place in the other movements . around 1954 , herbert von karajan flew especially to hear klemperer conduct a performance of the eroica , and later he said to him : '' i have come only to thank you , and say that i hope i shall live to conduct the funeral march as well as you have done '' . similar , if less extreme , reductions in tempi can be noted in many other works for which klemperer left multiple recordings , at least in recordings from when he was in his late 70s and his 80s . for example : ( a ) mozart 's symphony no . 38 prague , another klemperer specialty . in his concert recording from december 1950 ( when he was 65 years old ) with the rias berlin orchestra the timings are i . 9:45 ( with repeat timing omitted ; the performance actually does take the repeat ) ; ii . 7:45 ; and iii . 5.24 . in his studio march 1962 recording of the same work with the philharmonia ( recorded when he was 77 years old ) , the timings are notably slower : i . 10:53 ( no repeat was taken ) ; ii . 8.58 ; iii . 6:01 . unlike the late eroica , the 1962 prague is not notably slow ; rather , the 1950 recording is much faster than most recordings of the work , even by '' historically informed '' conductors . ( b ) symphony no . 4 romantic by anton bruckner ( haas edition with emendations ) . a 1947 concert recording with concertgebouw orchestra has timings of i . 14:03 ; ii . 12:58 ; iii . 10:11 ; and iv . 17.48 . the emi studio recording with the philharmonia from 1963 has timings of i . 16:09 ; ii ; 14:00 ; iii . 11.48 ; iv . 19:01 . again , the 1963 is not a notably slow performance , but the 1947 was quick . the march 1951 recording with the vienna symphony orchestra was even quicker : i . 13:26 ; ii . 11:56 ; iii . 9:22 ; iv . 16:30 . ( c ) symphony no . 7 ( mahler ) by gustav mahler recorded for emi in 1968 . i . 27:43 ; ii . 22:06 ; iii . 10:27 ; iv . 15:41 ; v . 24:15 . klemperer 's finale is particularly slow-paced at 24:15 , where the average timing is approx . 17:30 . compare klemperer 's tempi with sir georg solti for decca ( 1971 ) at 16:29 ; james levine for rca ( 1982 ) at 17:45 ; claudio abbado for dg ( 2002 ) also at 17:45 and the michael tilson thomas 2005 performance with the san francisco so at 18:05 . '' thus , as you listen to this performance , it seems . to enclose you within its own world of evocative sound , a world that echoes . the world we may know , but remains a world transformed by imagination , remote , and complete within itself . '' rcm , high fidelity magazine , december 1969 . regardless of tempo , klemperer 's performances often maintain great intensity , and are richly detailed . eric grunin , in a commentary on the '' opinions '' page of his eroica project , notes : '' . the massiveness of the first movement of the eroica is real , but is not its main claim on our attention . that honor goes to its astonishing story ( structure ) , and what is to me most unique about klemperer is that his understanding of the structure remains unchanged no matter what his tempo . '' . the german works of kurt weill were amongst klemperer 's favorites and he encouraged weill to compose the orchestral suite kleine dreigroschenmusik . discography . klemperer made many recordings which are regarded as classics . among the most noteworthy are : bach : st matthew passion with dietrich fischer-dieskau , peter pears , elisabeth schwarzkopf , christa ludwig , and walter berry bach : mass in b minor bach : brandenburg concertos with the philharmonia orchestra on εμι bartók : viola concerto ( with william primrose , and the concertgebouw orchestra , live version on archiphon ) beethoven : symphony cycles ( notably the one from the mid-1950s on emi ) beethoven : symphony no . 9 ( recorded live , november 1957 and also in 1961 ) beethoven : fidelio ( both the live recording from covent garden on testament , and the studio emi recording ) beethoven : missa solemnis beethoven : piano concertos nos . 3-5 , ( with claudio arrau , live versions issued on testament ) beethoven : piano concertos nos . 1-5 , ( with daniel barenboim , on emi ) brahms : symphony cycles brahms : violin concerto , with david oistrakh brahms : ein deutsches requiem , with elisabeth schwarzkopf and dietrich fischer-dieskau bruckner : symphony no . 4 ( bruckner ) bruckner : symphony no . 6 ( bruckner ) bruckner : symphony no . 9 ( bruckner ) with new york philharmonic , 1934 , and with new philharmonia on emi chopin : piano concerto no . 1 with claudio arrau , live version issued on music & arts franck : symphony in d minor handel : messiah , with elisabeth schwarzkopf , grace hoffman , nicolai gedda , and jerome hines haydn : symphonies 88 , 92 , 95 , 98 , 100 , 101 , 102 , 104 hindemith : nobilissima visione suite ( wdr symphony orchestra cologne , a 1954 version issued on andante ) janáček : sinfonietta ( a 1951 concertgebouw orchestra live version , released by archiphon ) mahler : das lied von der erde , with christa ludwig and fritz wunderlich mahler : symphony no . 2 ( mahler ) , ( 1 ) 1951 with kathleen ferrier & jo vincent ; ( 2 ) 1963 with elisabeth schwarzkopf & hilde rössel-majdan mahler : symphony no . 4 with elisabeth schwarzkopf mahler : symphony no . 7 , 1968 mahler : symphony no . 9 mendelssohn : symphonies nos . 3-4 mendelssohn : a midsummer night 's dream mozart : piano concerto no . 25 ( with daniel barenboim ) mozart : symphonies nos . 25 , 29 , 31 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 38 , 39 , 40 and 41 mozart : don giovanni ( live version issued on testament ) mozart : the magic flute , with nicolai gedda , walter berry , gundula janowitz , lucia popp , elisabeth schwarzkopf as the first lady schoenberg : verklärte nacht ( a 1955 live version with the concertgebouw orchestra , on archiphon ) schubert : symphonies 5 , 8 ( unfinished ) and 9 . philharmonia orchestra ( emi ) schumann : symphonies 1-4 , with the philharmonia orchestra . klemperer was the first to record them integrally schumann : piano concerto ( with annie fischer ) stravinsky : petrushka stravinsky : pulcinella stravinsky : symphony in three movements tchaikovsky : symphonies nos . 4 , 5 and 6 with the philharmonia orchestra on emi wagner : the flying dutchman ( with anja silja ) wagner : siegfried idyll in the original chamber version with members of the philharmonia orchestra weill : the threepenny opera , 1931 , 1967 klemperer conducted his own symphony no 2 in a 1970 emi recording ( asd 2575 ) that also included his seventh string quartet . a list of historical recordings of the los angeles philharmonic with klemperer conducting ( including parts of the george gershwin memorial concert at the hollywood bowl ) can be found here : los angeles philharmonic discography otto klemperer klemperer 's last recording , of mozart 's serenade no . 11 ( mozart ) , was made on 28 september 1971 , the last time he conducted ( apart from his conducting of a solitary movement from beethoven 's 7th symphony in munich on 6 september 1972 , as mentioned above ) . personal life . in 1919 , klemperer married soprano johanna geisler . they had two children , including werner klemperer , who would go on to become an actor . the diarist victor klemperer , who chronicled his life in the weimar republic and nazi germany was a cousin . . references . notes sources . external links . beating time : a play by jim grover about klemperer the stanford collection . a comprehensive film archive , collected by dr charles barber portrait of otto klemperer and johanna geisler by nickolas muray františek sláma – archive . more on the history of the czech philharmonic between the 1940s and the 1980s : conductors
