magnitude 8.14 to 8.33 over a period of 2.4 days , is the prototype for the fk comae berenices class of variable stars and the star in which the '' starspot '' was discovered . fs comae berenices is a semi-regular variable , a red giant with a period of about two months whose magnitude varies between 6.1 and 5.3 . r comae berenices is a mira variable with a maximum magnitude of almost 7 . there are 123 rr lyrae variables in the constellation , with many in the m53 cluster . one of these stars , tu comae berenices , may have a binary system . the m100 galaxy contains about twenty cepheid variables , which were observed by the hubble space telescope . coma berenices also contains alpha2 canum venaticorum variable , such as 13 comae berenices and ai comae berenices . in 2019 scientists at aryabhatta research institute of observational sciences announced the discovery of 28 new variable stars in coma berenices ' globular cluster ngc 4147 . . supernovae . a number of supernovae have been discovered in coma berenices . four ( sn 1940b , sn 1969h , sn 1987e and sn 1999gs ) were in the ngc 4725 galaxy , and another four were discovered in the m99 galaxy ( ngc 4254 ) : sn 1967h , sn

observed type ii supernova . sn 2005ap , discovered on 3 march 2005 , is the second-brightest-known supernova to date with a peak absolute magnitude of about −22.7 . due to its great distance from earth ( 4.7 billion light-years ) , it was not visible to the naked eye and was discovered telescopically . sn & nbsp ; 1979c , discovered in 1979 , retained its original x-ray brightness for 25 years despite fading in visible light . . other stars . coma berenices also contains the neutron star rbs 1223 and the pulsar psr b1237+25 . rbs 1223 is a member of the magnificent seven , a group of young neutron stars . in 1975 , the first extra-solar source of extreme ultraviolet , the white dwarf hz 43 , was discovered in coma berenices . in 1995 , there was a very rare outburst of the wz sagittae-type dwarf nova al comae berenices . a june 2003 outburst from go comae berenices , an su ursae majoris-type dwarf nova , was photometrically observed . . exoplanets . coma berenices has seven known exoplanets . one , hd 108874 b , has earth-like insolation . wasp-56 is a sun-like star of spectral type g6 and apparent magnitude 11.48 with a planet 0.6 the mass of jupiter that has a period of 4.6 days . . star clusters . . coma star cluster . the coma star cluster represents berenice 's sacrificed tresses and as a naked eye object has been known since antiquity , appearing in ptolemy 's almagest . it does n't have a messier or ngc designation , but is in the melotte catalogue of open clusters ( designated melotte 111 ) and is also catalogued as collinder 256 . it is a large , diffuse open cluster of about 50 stars ranging between magnitudes five and ten , including several of coma berenices ' stars which are visible to the naked eye . the cluster is spread over a huge region ( more than five degrees across ) near gamma comae berenices . it has such a large apparent size because it is relatively close , only 288 light-years away . globular clusters . m53 ( ngc 5024 ) is a globular cluster which was discovered independently by johann elert bode in 1775 and charles messier in february 1777 ; william herschel was the first to resolve it into stars . the magnitude-7.7 cluster is 56,000 light-years from earth . only 1° away is ngc 5053 , a globular cluster with a sparser nucleus of stars . its total luminosity is the equivalent of about 16,000 suns , one of the lowest luminosities of any globular cluster . it was discovered by william herschel in 1784 . ngc 4147 is a somewhat dimmer globular cluster , with a much-smaller apparent size . galaxies . . coma supercluster . the coma supercluster , itself part of the coma filament , contains the coma and leo cluster of galaxies . the coma cluster ( abell 1656 ) is 230 to 300 million light-years away . it is one of the largest-known clusters , with at least 10,000 galaxies ( mainly elliptical , with a few spiral galaxies ) . due to its distance from earth , most of the galaxies are visible only through large telescopes . its brightest members are ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 , both with a magnitude of 13 ; most others are magnitude 15 or dimmer . ngc 4889 is a giant elliptical galaxy with one of the largest-known black holes ( 21 billion solar masses ) , and ngc 4921 is the cluster 's brightest spiral galaxy . after observing the coma cluster , astronomer fritz zwicky first postulated the existence of dark matter during the 1930s . the massive galaxy dragonfly 44 discovered in 2015 was found to consist almost entirely of dark matter . its mass is very similar to that of the milky way , but it emits only 1 % of the light emitted by the milky way . ngc 4676 , sometimes called the mice galaxies , is a pair of interacting galaxy 300 million light-years from earth . its progenitor galaxies were spiral , and astronomers estimate that they had their closest approach about 160 million years ago . that approach triggered large regions of star formation in both galaxies , with long '' tails '' of dust , stars and gas . the two progenitor galaxies are predicted to interact significantly at least one more time before they merge into a larger , probably-elliptical galaxy . . virgo cluster . coma berenices contains the northern portion of the virgo cluster ( also known as the coma–virgo cluster ) , about 60 million light-years away . the portion includes six messier galaxies . m85 ( ngc 4382 ) , considered elliptical or lenticular , is one of the cluster 's brighter members at magnitude nine . m85 is interacting with the spiral galaxy ngc 4394 and the elliptical galaxy mcg-3-32-38 . m88 ( ngc 4501 ) is a multi-arm spiral galaxy seen at about 30° from edge-on . it has a highly-regular shape with well-developed , symmetrical arms . among the first galaxies recognized as spiral , it has a supermassive black hole in its center . m91 ( ngc 4548 ) , a barred spiral galaxy with a bright , diffuse nucleus , is the faintest object in messier 's catalog at magnitude 10.2 . m98 ( ngc 4192 ) , a bright , elongated spiral galaxy seen nearly edge-on , appears elliptical because of its unusual angle . the magnitude-10 galaxy has no redshift . m99 ( ngc 4254 ) is a spiral galaxy seen face-on . like m98 it is of magnitude-10 and has an unusually long arm on its west side . m100 ( ngc 4321 ) , a magnitude-nine spiral galaxy seen face-on , is one of the cluster 's brightest . photographs reveal a brilliant core , two prominent spiral arms , an array of secondary arms and several dust lanes . other galaxies . thumb m64 ( ngc 4826 ) is known as the black eye galaxy because of the prominent dark dust lane in front of the galaxy 's bright nucleus . also known as the sleeping beauty and evil eye galaxy , it is about 24 million light-years away . recent studies indicate that the interstellar gas in the galaxy 's outer regions rotates in the opposite direction from that in the inner regions , leading astronomers to believe that at least one satellite galaxy collided with it less than a billion years ago . all other evidence of the smaller galaxy has been assimilated . at the interface between the clockwise- and counterclockwise-rotating regions are many new nebulae and young stars . ngc 4314 is a face-on barred spiral galaxy at a distance of 40 million light-years . it is unique for its region of intense star formation , creating a ring around its nucleus which was discovered by the hubble space telescope . the galaxy 's prodigious star formation began five million years ago , in a region with a diameter of 1,000 light-years . the core 's structure is also unique because the galaxy has spiral arms which feed gas into the bar . ngc 4414 is an unbarred spiral flocculent galaxy about 62 million light-years away . it is one of the closest flocculent spiral galaxies . ngc 4565 is an edge-on spiral galaxy which appears superimposed on the virgo cluster . ngc 4565 has been nicknamed the needle galaxy because when seen in full , it appears as a narrow streak of light . like many edge-on spiral galaxies , it has a prominent dust lane and a central bulge . ngc 4651 , about the size of the milky way , has tidal stellar streams gravitationally stripped from a smaller , satellite galaxy . it is about 62 million light-years away . spiral galaxy malin 1 discovered in 1986 is the first-known giant low-surface-brightness galaxy . with ugc 1382 , it is also one of the largest low-surface-brightness galaxies . in 2006 a dwarf galaxy , also named coma berenices , was discovered in the constellation . the galaxy is a faint satellite of the milky way . file : ngc 4789a , a subtle swarm.jpg dwarf irregular galaxy ngc 4789a alt diffuse galaxy file : needle galaxy 4565.jpeg alt galaxy resembling an angled needle ngc 4565 (

quasars . w comae berenices ( or on 231 ) , a blazar in the constellation 's northwest , was originally designated a variable star and later found to be a bl lacertae object . as of 2009 , it had the most intense gamma ray spectrum of the sixty known gamma-ray blazars . gamma-ray bursts . some gamma-ray bursts occurred in coma berenices , particularly grb 050509b on 9 may 2005 and grb 080607 on 7 june 2008 . grb 050509b , which lasted only 0.03 second , became the first short burst with a detected afterglow . . meteor shower . the coma berenicids meteor shower peaks around 18 january . despite the shower 's low intensity ( averaging one or two meteors per hour ) its meteors are some of the fastest , with speeds up to . . in culture . since callimachus ' poem , coma berenices has been occasionally featured in culture . in 1886 , spanish artist luis ricardo falero created a mezzotint print personifying coma berenices alongside virgo and leo . in 1892 , the russian poet afanasy fet made the constellation the subject of his short poem , composed for the countess natalya sollogub . the swedish poet gunnar ekelöf wrote the lines '' your friend the comet combed his hair with the leonids / berenice let her hair hang down from the sky '' in a 1933 poem . american writer and folksinger richard fariña mentions coma berenices in his 1966 novel been down so long it looks like up to me , sardonically writing about content typical to upper-level astronomy coursework at cornell : '' it 's the advanced courses give you trouble . relativity principles , spiral nebula in coma berenices , that kind of hassle . the bolivian poet , pedro shimose , makes coma berenices the home address of his '' señorita ngc 4565 '' in his poem '' carta a una estrella que vive en otra constelación '' ( '' letter to a star who lives in another constellation '' ) , included in his 1967 collection , '' sardonia '' . ( la paz : universidad mayor de san andrés , 1967 ) . '' the irish poet w . b . yeats , in his poem '' her dream '' , refers to '' berenice 's burning hair '' being '' nailed upon the night '' . francisco guerrero , a 20th-century spanish composer , wrote an orchestral work on the constellation in 1996 . in 1999 irish artist alice maher made a series of four oversize drawings , entitled coma berenices , of entwining black hair coils . . notes .
