'' avant-pop : fiction for a daydream nation . boulder : black ice books ( 1993 ) p253 . bruce sterling has cited shirley 's early story collection heatseeker as being a seminal cyberpunk work in itself . several stories in heatseeker were particularly seminal , including sleepwalkers , which , in just one example , probably provided the inspiration for william gibson 's '' meat puppets '' in neuromancer . gibson acknowledged shirley 's influence in an introduction to shirley 's city come a-walkin . shirley 's story collection , made up of increasingly bizarre stories , the whimsically titled really , really , really , really weird stories has developed a cult status . william gibson , the author of neuromancer , collaborated with shirley on short stories—as did fellow cyberpunks bruce sterling and rudy rucker . shirley 's lyricism , wealth of ideas and imagination , crossover pioneering , and street-level honesty have been praised by other writers including clive barker , peter straub , roger zelazny , marc laidlaw , and a . a . attanasio . his more surreal work , as in a splendid chaos , showed how it was possible to describe the indescribable with a paradoxical believability and impeccable internal logic no matter how bizarre the subject matter . shirley 's personal experiences as a recovering drug addict and punk rocker brought verisimilitude to his darker , urban-tinctured writing . in recent years shirley has written a number of '' tie-in novels '' and novelizations , such as constantine , based on the keanu reaves movie , and the best-seller bioshock : rapture , ( tor , 2011 ) , a novel providing a prequel to the bioshock video game story and halo : broken circle . he also wrote the apocalyptic , politically charged novel , the other end which , according to the author 's website , takes the apocalypse away from the christian right and gives judgment day to liberals to do with as they please . this reflects shirley 's tendency to create fantasy entertainment which is also political satire , or spiritual allegory . e.g . , demons , in which it is discovered that industry has deliberately caused deaths by cancer as part of a vast secret program of human sacrifice . 2007 saw the release of a new story collection , living shadows , from prime books . his novel of dark urban fantasy set in a slightly futuristic new york , bleak history , was published by simon & schuster/pocket books in 2009 . in august 2011 underland press published in extremis : the most extreme stories of john shirley and in january 2012 prime books published his near future apocalyptic political allegory , the novel everything is broken . his novel about arthur conan doyle in the afterlife , doyle after death , was released by harpercollins/witness in october 2013 . shirley 's apocalyptic and surreal novel high , based on his early novel three-ring psychus , has been re-released by start books as an e-book ; his newest story collection is 'feverish stars ( march 2020 ) . in june 2020 his fantasy novel sorcerer of atlantis will be released by hippocampus . shirley 's work ranges in tone from the surreal to the grittily naturalistic to the nightmarish . he is also a songwriter and singer , having fronted numerous punk bands , including the new york city band obsession , who were recorded by celluloid records . he has written lyrics for blue öyster cult , such as several songs on the album heaven forbid . in 2013 black october records released a two-cd compilation of shirley 's own recordings , broken mirror glass : the john shirley anthology – 1978–2012 . in 2020 reprehensible records released the rock albumthe screaming geezers ; vocals and lyrics by john shirley . shirley performs regularly in the portland , oregon rock scene . 2014 saw the release of shirley 's first historical novel , wyatt in wichita , a novel of the young wyatt earp . other recent novels are halo : broken circle , doyle after death and a novelization of mark tremonti 's science-fiction rock opera , a dying machine . shirley is a member of the satirical '' religion '' church of the subgenius . awards . john shirley received several nominations and won the following awards . bram stoker awards – for horror works , voted by horror writer 's association professional membership ( 2 nominations ; 1 win ) 1999 : '' what would you do for love ?
