early life . robert was probably the eldest of henry 's many illegitimate children . he was born before his father 's accession to the english throne , either during the reign of his grandfather william the conqueror or his uncle william rufus . he is sometimes and erroneously designated as a son of nest , daughter of rhys ap tewdwr , last king of deheubarth , although his mother has been identified as a member of '' the gay or gayt family of north oxfordshire '' , david crouch , historical research , 1999 possibly a daughter of rainald gay ( fl . 1086 ) of hampton gay and northbrook gay in oxfordshire . rainald had known issue robert gay of hampton ( died c . 1138 ) and stephen gay of northbrook ( died after 1154 ) . a number of oxfordshire women feature as the mothers of robert 's siblings . c . given-wilson & a . curteis . the royal bastards of medieval england ( london , 1984 ) , page 74 robert may have been a native of caen or he may have been only constable and governor of that city , jure uxoris .

and his wife mabel fitzhamon married in 1119 , and they had seven children : william fitzrobert ( c.1121 & ndash ; 1183 ) : succeeded his father as 2nd earl of gloucester roger fitzrobert ( c . 1123 & ndash ; 1179 ) : bishop of worcester hamon fitzrobert , knight ( c . 1124 & ndash ; 1159 ) : killed at the siege of toulouse . richard fitzrobert , lord of creully ( c . 1125 & ndash ; 1175 ) : succeeded his mother as sire de creully . matilda fitzrobert ( c . 1126 & ndash ; 1189 ) : married in 1143 ranulf de gernon , 4th earl of chester . mabel fitzrobert : married aubrey de vere philip fitzrobert , lord of cricklade ( c . 1130 & ndash ; 1148 ) he also had four illegitimate children : richard fitzrobert ( died 1142 ) : bishop of bayeux mother : isabel de douvres , sister of richard de douvres , bishop of bayeux ( 1107–1133 ) robert fitzrobert ( died 1170 ) : castellan of gloucester , married in 1147 hawise de reviers ( daughter of baldwin de redvers , 1st earl of devon and his first wife adelisa ) , had daughter mabel fitzrobert ( married firstly jordan de chambernon and secondly william de soliers ) mabel fitzrobert : married gruffud , lord of senghenydd , son of ifor bach . thomas fitzrobert . relationship with king stephen . there is evidence in the contemporary source , the gesta stephani , that robert was proposed by some as a candidate for the throne , but his illegitimacy ruled him out : this suggestion can not have led to any idea that he and stephen were rivals for the crown , as geoffrey of monmouth in 1136 referred to robert as one of the 'pillars ' of the new king 's rule . the capture of king stephen at the battle of lincoln on 2 february 1141 gave the empress matilda the upper hand in her battle for the throne , but by alienating the citizens of london she failed to be crowned queen . her forces were defeated at the rout of winchester on 14 september 1141 , and robert of gloucester was captured nearby at stockbridge . the two prisoners , king stephen and robert of gloucester , were then exchanged , but by freeing stephen , the empress matilda had given up her best chance of becoming queen . she later returned to france , where she died in 1167 , though her son succeeded stephen as king henry ii in 1154 . robert of gloucester died in 1147 at bristol castle , where he had previously imprisoned king stephen , and was buried at st james ' priory , bristol , which he had founded in 1129 . in popular culture . robert of gloucester is a figure in many of the novels by ellis peters in the cadfael chronicles ( written between 1977 and 1994 ) where he is seen as a strong moderating force to his half-sister ( see saint peter 's fair ) . his efforts to gain the crown for his sister by capturing king stephen and her own actions in london are part of the plot in the pilgrim of hate . his capture by stephen 's wife queen mathilda is in the background of the plot of an excellent mystery . the exchange of the imprisoned robert for the imprisoned stephen is in the background of the plot of the raven in the foregate . robert 's travels to persuade his brother-in-law to aid empress maud militarily in england is in the background of the novel the rose rent . his return to england when empress maud is trapped in oxford castle figures in the hermit of eyton forest . robert 's return to england with his young nephew henry , years later the king succeeding stephen , is in the background of the plot of the confession of brother haluin , as the battles begin anew with robert 's military guidance . robert 's success in the battle of wilton ( 1143 ) leads to the death of a fictional character , part of the plot of the potter 's field . in the last novel , he is a father who can disagree with then forgive his son philip ( see the last novel , brother cadfael 's penance ) . in that last novel , brother cadfael speculates on the possibly different path for england if the first son of old king henry , the illegitimate robert of gloucester , had been recognised and accepted . in wales of that era , a son was not illegitimate if recognized by his father , and to many in the novels , robert of gloucester seemed the best of the contenders to succeed his father . robert is also a central character in sharon penman 's 1995 novel when christ and his saints slept . he was also central in the struggle during the anarchy as portrayed in ken follet 's 1989 novel the pillars of the earth and in the 2010 mini-series of the same name . see also . kenfig castle – an important 12th-century motte and bailey for controlling the
