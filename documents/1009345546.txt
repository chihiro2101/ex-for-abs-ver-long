Stratford, New Zealand

geography . road and rail . stratford is at the junction of state highway 3 and state highway 43 . on state highway 3 new plymouth is north , inglewood north , eltham south and hāwera south . on state highway 43 taumarunui is to the east . this road is known as '' the forgotten world highway '' , due to the scarcity of settlement along the road in contrast to its earlier history . a sign reads '' no petrol for '' . stratford railway station is the junction of the marton–new plymouth and stratford–okahukura lines . physical geography . the stratford district takes in about one quarter of the taranaki region , and includes four major geological features : the taranaki volcanic cone , its associated ring plain , the patea river catchment , and the eastern hill country . taranaki volcanic cone . the south-eastern face of mount taranaki is in the stratford district , the north-westernmost point of the district being the 2518 m high peak . from the peak the boundaries run almost due east and due south . pembroke road winds up the mountain slope from stratford to a carpark and lookout at '' the plateau '' , at manganui is a short hike from the carpark , across the manganui gorge . on the south-eastern face of the mountain , manaia road gives access to dawson falls and the konini lodge , at altitude . the natural wilkies pools are a short hike above the lodge . taranaki volcanic ring plain . the taranaki volcanic ring plain provides a steady contour with a subtle gradient , upon which stratford and its environs have been settled . the easy gradient and rich volcanic soils and the high level of rainfall provide high quality pasture and agricultural land . within this area the ring plain is drained by three river catchments : the manganui river catchment to the north , the waingongoro river catchment to the south , and the dominant patea river catchment . patea river . the headwaters of the patea river are on the eastern face of mount taranaki , above stratford . from there the river flows eastwards , its upper catchment taking in a narrow area of land between the manganui river catchment to the north and the waingongoro river catchment to the south . stratford is on the banks of the patea river , at the junction of the patea river and paetahi stream , approximately east of the headwaters . due to the narrow width of the catchment , the southern boundary of the town is on the patea/waingongoro divide , while to the north midhirst is on the patea/manganui divide . beyond stratford the catchment widens significantly to include a number of ancient swamps , including ngaere and toko , and also the kahouri and piakau ring plain streams . the river then takes in the expansive eastern hill country catchments of the toko , makuri , mangaehu , mangaotuku , puniwhakau and makahu streams , before winding its way southwards through the hills of the south taranaki district , to its mouth at patea . eastern hill country . beyond stratford the district extends approximately to the east , between the waitara river to the north and the matemateāonga range to the south , with the whanganui river and heao stream constituting much of the district 's eastern boundary . this area is dominated by steep sandstone , greywacke and mudstone hills and winding valleys . much of the steep and isolated hill country is in native or exotic forestry . the remainder of the district is in sheep and/or beef pastoral farming . much of the eastern hill country falls within the catchment of the patea river and its tributaries . however , to the north the district takes in waitara river and its tributaries , including the makara , makino , matau , mangapapa and mangaowata catchments . at its northernmost point the district also includes the mt damper stream and its associated swamp and falls , which feed into the tongaporutu river . in the east the district takes in the whangamōmona river catchment , and also most of the tangarakau river catchment , both of which feed into the whanganui river . this area is separated from the west by the densely forested whangamōmona saddle , making it an isolated and distinctive part of the district , and the area once had its own county council . to the south-east the district also takes in the upper reaches of the waitotara river catchment , within the matemateāonga range and the waitotara conservation area . surrounding settlements . stratford is surrounded by a number of small villages and settlements . to the north on state highway 3 are midhirst and beyond that waipuku , and to the south is the locality of ngaere . cardiff , mahoe , rowan and pembroke are beneath the mountain to the west , and wharehuia , tuna , te popo and kupe are to the north-east . to the east , along state highway 43 and the stratford-okahukura railway , lie settlements that in their heyday were bustling villages . toko and the renowned whangamōmona have retained their character as villages , while the settlements of douglas , strathmore , huiakama , te wera , pohokura , marco , kohuratahi and tahora now consist of no more than a few houses . along roads off state highway 3 are a number of other settlements , some of which were also once bustling villages . huiroa , kiore , matau and mt . damper are to the north and west of the highway , and huinga , tututawa , puniwhakau , makahu , aotuhia and tangarakau are to the south and east . national parks . stratford is the gateway to two national parks - egmont national park to the west , and whanganui national park to the east ( via kohi saddle , aotuhia ) . population . stratford is a rural service centre , serving the agricultural economy of its wider hinterland . the population of the district peaked in 1961 at 11,300 , and until the end of the century the town fluctuated between 5229 ( 2001 ) and 5664 ( 1996 ) . the 21st century has seen significant economic growth and some associated population growth in the town . stratford district had a population of 9,474 at the 2018 new zealand census , an increase of 486 people ( 5.4 % ) since the 2013 census , and an increase of 585 people ( 6.6 % ) since the 2006 census . there were 3,687 households . there were 4,722 males and 4,752 females , giving a sex ratio of 0.99 males per female . of the total population , 2,043 people ( 21.6 % ) were aged up to 15 years , 1,635 ( 17.3 % ) were 15 to 29 , 4,152 ( 43.8 % ) were 30 to 64 , and 1,644 ( 17.4 % ) were 65 or older . figures may not add up to the total due to rounding . ethnicities were 91.4 % european/pākehā , 14.2 % māori , 1.4 %

although some people objected to giving their religion , 50.2 % had no religion , 37.7 % were christian , and 2.5 % had other religions . of those at least 15 years old , 669 ( 9.0 % ) people had a bachelor or higher degree , and 2,142 ( 28.8 % ) people had no formal qualifications . the median income was 28,700 . the employment status of those at least 15 was that 3,672 ( 49.4 % ) people were employed full-time , 1,080 ( 14.5 % ) were part-time , and 270 ( 3.6 % ) were unemployed . . economy . the egmont ring plain provides steady contours and fertile volcanic soils which , together with the high level of rainfall , make for some of the best dairy country in new zealand . the district is predominantly dairying ( 57,300 dairy cattle ) , while the rolling to steep eastern hill country supports dry stock farming and forestry ( 42,000 beef cattle ; 281,300 sheep ) . the energy and tourism industries are both of growing significance to the stratford district . the stratford power station is located east of the town . history and culture . whakaahurangi . the māori name for stratford is whakaahurangi , meaning to look to the sky . the name is taken from a story of the ngati ruanui chieftainess/puhi ariki named ruapu-tahanga who , fled her husband whatihua from waikato , she travelled the track known as te ara tapu o ruaputahanga which stretches from urenui down through tariki , and ends near patea ) . here she stopped at the side of the kahouri river near a fresh water spring . it is said she sat distraught and cried into the spring , naming it te puna roimata o ruaputahanga the spring of ruaputahangas tears hear camped overnight east of the current town . being a clear night , ruaputahanga lay contemplating the stars when slumber overtook her . withdrawing in respect , her followers observed that their chieftainess slept '' with her face to the sky '' . the site continued to be used as a camping place for māori , the track she followed linking the south taranaki tribes to those in north taranaki , and further north to kawhia . each traveling party would recollect the story of ruapu-tahanga sleeping with her face to the sky . gordon , w.f . , battersby , j.h . , richards , j.b . , kennedy , w.l . , and kelly , c.s . carved from the bush : stratford 1878-1928 . 1928 . the name is fitting , given the exposure of the area to a broad horizon on the face of the mountain 's ring plain . surveying . there is no record of māori settlement in the vicinity of stratford . before british settlement the area was covered in dense forest and swamp . the julius vogel of the 1870s provided the necessary impetus to lead to the construction of a railway line south of new plymouth , and the creation of road access at the same time , to open up access to the rich soils under the mountain . in 1876 , taranaki waste lands board assistant surveyor edwin stanley brookes , jnr . cut a meridian line from waitara to the site of stratford , and oversaw the subdivision of a block between the manganui river and the patea river . the surveying of a new site for a town on the banks of the patea river was authorised on 11 june 1877 , and the northern half of the town ( above the patea river ) was laid out by william skinner in july . more lots were laid out by peter cheal in 1879 , and in 1880 skinner was directed to survey the southern half of the town . naming . on 3 december 1877 , the name stratford-upon-patea was adopted , on the motion of william crompton of the taranaki waste lands board . the supposed similarity of the patea river to the river avon in england led to the adoption of this name , and crompton was known to have a literary turn of mind . there was a trend at the time to name towns after the birthplace of prominent british men . the william shakespeare 'connection ' led to the naming of 67 streets after shakespearian characters from 27 of his plays . today new zealand 's only carillon clock tower plays the balcony scene from romeo and juliet three times a day . the spoken words are provided via external loudspeakers - there is no carillon ( multiple bells ) as would be more typical for glockenspiels in towers . settlement and growth . stratford was formally classified as a town in june 1878 , and on 31 august 1878 an auction of 455 sections saw the first sections sold . by 1881 the population was 97 , comprising 56 males and 41 females , with 22 houses . by 1891 this had grown to a population of 342 and by 1896 1,256 . this growth continued steadily until the mid-late 20th century , and has since fluctuated between 5229 ( 2001 ) and 5664 ( 1996 ) , numbering 5,337 at the last census . marae . whakaahurangi marae , a marae ( meeting ground ) of the ngāti ruanui tribe and its ahitahi sub-tribe , is located
