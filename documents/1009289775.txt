Dickinson College

history . 18thâ€“20th centuries . the carlisle grammar school was founded in 1773 as a frontier latin school for young men in western pennsylvania . within years carlisle 's elite , such as james wilson and john montgomery , were pushing for development of the school as a college . in 1782 , benjamin rush , a physician who was a prominent leader during and after the american revolution , met in philadelphia with montgomery and william bingham , a prominent businessman and politician . as their conversation about founding a frontier college in carlisle took place on his porch , '' bingham 's porch '' was long a rallying cry at dickinson . dickinson college was chartered by the pennsylvania legislature on september 9 , 1783 , six days after the signing of the treaty of paris ( 1783 ) that ended the american revolution ; it was the first college to be founded in the newly independent nation . rush intended to name the college after the governor of pennsylvania john dickinson and his wife mary norris dickinson , proposing '' john and mary 's college . '' the dickinsons had given the new college an extensive library which they jointly owned , one of the largest libraries in the colonies . the name dickinson college was chosen instead . when founded , its location west of the susquehanna river made it the westernmost college in the united states . for the first meeting of the trustees , held in april 1784 , rush made his first journey to carlisle . the trustees selected charles nisbet , a scottish minister and scholar , to serve as the college 's first president . he arrived and began to serve on july 4 , 1785 , serving until his unexpected death in 1804 . a combination of financial troubles and faculty dissension led to a college closing from 1816 to 1821 . in 1832 , when the trustees were unable to resolve a faculty curriculum dispute , they ordered dickinson 's temporary closure a second time . the law school dates to 1833 . it became a separate school 1890 , although the law school and the college continued to share a president until 1912 . the law school is now affiliated with the pennsylvania state university . among the 18th-century graduates of dickinson were robert cooper grier and roger brooke taney , who later became u.s . supreme court justices , and served together on the court for 18 years . during the 19th century , two noted dickinson college alumni had prominent roles in the lead up to the civil war . they were james buchanan , the 15th president of the united states , and roger brooke taney , the 5th chief justice of the united states . dickinson is one of three liberal arts colleges to have graduated a president and a chief justice ( bowdoin and amherst are the others ) . taney led the supreme court in its ruling on the dred scott v . sandford decision , which held that congress could not prohibit slavery in federal territories , overturning the missouri compromise . buchanan threw the full prestige of his administration behind congressional approval of the lecompton constitution in kansas . during the civil war , the campus and town of carlisle were occupied twice by confederate forces in 1863 . when george metzger , class of 1798 , died in 1879 , he left his land and 25,000 to the town of carlisle to found a college for women . in 1881 , the metzger institute opened . the college operated independently until 1913 , when its building was leased to dickinson college for the education of women . the building served as a women 's dorm until 1963 . in 1887 , zatae longsdorff became the first woman to graduate from dickinson . in 1901 , john robert paul brock became the first black man to graduate from dickinson ; in 1919 , esther popel shaw was the first black woman to graduate . henry clarke , an alumnus who developed the klondike bar into a national brand for an ice cream bar , founded the clarke forum for contemporary issues at dickinson college , and in 1994 established the clarke center . the town of carlisle was also the location of the carlisle army barracks , which was adapted in the late 1870s for use as the carlisle indian industrial school . in 1879 dickinson college and the nearby carlisle indian school began a collaboration , when james andrew mccauley , president of the college , led the first worship service at the indian school . the collaboration between the institutions lasted almost four decades , from the opening day to the closing of the indian school in 1918 . dickinson college professors served as chaplains and special faculty to the native american students . professor charles francis himes , dr . george edward reed , stephen baird , and joshua lippincott fostered the relationship between the institutions through religious services , advisory meetings , lectures , and commencement speeches . dickinson college students volunteered services , observed teaching methods , and participated in events at the indian school . dickinson students visited the indian school to offer their talents and services . the october 24 , 1896 dickinsonian reported that volunteer sunday school teachers came from the college chapter of the ymca . those teachers with indian students were said to '' enjoy a rare privilege . the work is doubly interesting because one can be studying the characteristics of his scholars , at the same time learning many valuable lessons in methods of teaching . '' the college gave dickinson students a half-day holiday to attend the annual commencement and '' very interesting exercises '' at the indian school . dickinson college accepted select indian school students to attend its preparatory school ( '' conway hall '' ) and gain college-level education . dickinson also admitted native american students directly : thomas marshall was one of the first such students at dickinson . in 1910 , frank mount pleasant was the first native american to graduate from dickinson college . 21st century . since 2000 , dickinson 's acceptance rate has dropped by 20 % ,
