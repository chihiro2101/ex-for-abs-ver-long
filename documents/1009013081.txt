Leptospermum scoparium

description . it is a prolific scrub-type tree and is often one of the first species to regenerate on cleared land . it is typically a shrub growing to tall , but can grow into a moderately sized tree , up to or so in height . it is evergreen , with dense branching and small leaf long and broad , with a short spine tip . the flowers are white , occasionally pink , ( rarely up to in diameter , with five petals . the wood is tough and hard . this species is often confused with the related species kānuka ( kunzea ericoides ) – the easiest way to tell the difference between the two species in the field is to feel their foliage – mānuka leaves are prickly , while kānuka leaves are soft . j . dawson , r . lucas , nature guide to the new zealand forest . godwit , 2000 alternatively , the seed capsules of mānuka are large in diameter ) and are not present for much of the year . the latin specific epithet scoparium means '' like broom '' , referring to northern hemisphere genera such as genista and cytisus which it superficially resembles , but to which it is only distantly related . history and habitat . evidence suggests that l . scoparium originated in australia before the onset of the miocene aridity , and moved as a result of biological dispersal to new zealand from eastern australia sometime during the last 20 million years ( stephens et al , 2010 ) . cyclones and other wind activity are most likely responsible for transporting seeds long distances . supporters of this claim cite evidence that the genus leptospermum arose under conditions where frequent forest fires were common ( i.e . in australia , and not temperate new zealand ) , because they possess fire-adaptive traits like serotiny and storage lignotubers . it has been postulated that on arrival in new zealand , l . scoparium became established in limited edaphically suitable areas until the arrival of the polynesian people , whose fire and forest-clearing brought about the low-nutrient-status soils for which it was preadapted in its homeland . it is now more common in new zealand than it is in australia . it is found throughout new zealand , but is particularly common on the drier east coasts of the north and south islands , and in australia in tasmania , victoria and new south wales . j . m . c . stephens , p . c . molan & b . d . clarkson ( 2005 ) a review of leptospermum�scoparium ( myrtaceae ) in new zealand , new zealand journal of botany , 43:2 , 431-449 , doi : 10.1080/0028825x.2005.9512966 . ecology . pests and diseases . the adult mānuka beetle ( pyronota festiva ) and its larvae feed on l . scoparium in new zealand . . pollinators . various pollinators are known to visit l . scoparium , some examples include melangyna novaezelandiae , hylaeus , and honey bee . . continued evolution . leptospermum scoparium is in the process of evolutionary differentiation as a result of its isolation from fellow members of the leptospermum genus . new studies demonstrate a loss of lignotubers among populations of leptospermum scoparium located in relatively fire-free zones of new zealand 's south island , while australian and tasmanian populations retain their lignotubers along with stronger manifestations of serotiny . australian populations of leptospermum scoparium are shown to be chemically distinct from their new zealand counterparts , with significantly higher levels of cinteole and monoterpene . chemotypical variations also exist between different populations within new zealand , leading some to suggest that l . & nbsp ; scoparium be divided into three subspecies : those with high pinenes , high triketones , and high sesquiterpenes . recently , however , new research suggests that plant-to-plant variation far outstrips the variation seen between geographically isolated manuka sites , at least with regard to nectar chemistry . . names . tea tree , and are common names for this species .
