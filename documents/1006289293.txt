HGM-25A Titan I

silos . weapon system 107a-2 was a weapon system . i encompassed all of the equipment and even the bases for the titan i strategic missile . the titan i was first american icbm designed to be based in underground silos , and it gave usaf managers , contractors and missile crews valuable experience building and working in vast complexes containing everything the missiles and crews needed for operation and survival . the complexes were composed of an entry portal , control center , powerhouse , terminal room , two antenna silos for the athena guidance radar antennas , and three launchers each composed of : three equipment terminals , three propellant terminals , and three missile silos . all connected by an extensive network of tunnels . united states air force , the t.o .

isolated with double door blast locks the doors of which could not be open at the same time . this was to ensure that if there was an explosion in a missile launcher or the site was under attack , only the exposed antenna and/or missile silo would be damaged . united states air force , the t.o . 21m-hgm25a-1-1 technical manual operation and organizational maintenance hgm-25a missile weapon

missile analyst technician ( bmat ) , and two electrical power production technicians ( eppt ) . united states air force , the t.o . 21m-hgm25a-1-1 technical manual operation and organizational

operator , power house chief , three pad chiefs , three assistant pad chiefs , another cook and more air police . there could be a number of electricians , plumbers , power production technicians , air conditioning technicians , and other specialist when maintenance was being performed . simpson , charles g , the titan i part 2 , breckenridge , colorado : association of air force missileers , october 1993 , p . 5 . these early complexes while safe from a nearby nuclear detonation , however , had certain drawbacks . first , the missiles took about 15 minutes to fuel , and then , one at a time , had to be lifted to the surface on elevators for launching and guidance , which slowed their reaction time . rapid launching was crucial to avoid possible destruction by incoming missiles . even though titan complexes were designed to withstand nearby nuclear blasts antenna and missile extended for launch and guidance were quite susceptible to even a relatively distant miss . united

squadron were placed at least 17 ( usually 20 to 30 ) miles apart so that a single nuclear weapon could not take out two sites . green warren e.1962 , the development of the sm-68 titan ,

failed it could '' handover '' its missiles to another site of the squadron . hoselton , gary a . , titan i guidance system , brekenridge , colorado : association of air force missileers , volume 6 ,

3-100 the distance between the antenna silos and the most distant missile silo was between 1,000 and . these were by far the most complex , extensive and expensive missile launch facilities ever deployed by the usaf . simpson , charles g , the titan i part 1 , breckenridge , colorado : association of air force missileers , july 1993 , p . 3 . green warren e . , 1962 , the development of the

silo , and then raising the launcher and missile out of the silo on an elevator . before each launch , the guidance radar , which was periodically calibrated by acquiring a special target at a precisely known range and bearing , hoselton , gary a . , titan i guidance system , brekenridge , colorado : association of air force missileers , volume 6 , number 1 , march 1998 , p . 7 . had to

missile weapon system , united states air force , 1964 , paragraph 1-159 when the missile was launched , the guidance radar tracked the missile and supplied precise velocity range and azimuth data to the guidance computer , which then generated guidance corrections that were transmitted to the missile . because of this , the complex could only launch and track one missile at a time , although another could be elevated while the first was being guided . retirement . when the storable-fueled titan ii and the solid-fueled minuteman i were deployed in 1963 , the titan i and atlas missiles became obsolete . they were retired from service as icbms in early 1965 . on alert an operational history of the united states air force intercontinental ballistic missile ( icbm ) program , 1945-2011

) occurred on 5 march 1965 . at that time , the disposition of the 101 total production missiles was as follows : 17 were test launched from vafb ( september 1961 – march 1965 ) one was destroyed in beale afb site 851-c1 silo explosion 24 may 1962 54 were deployed in silos on 20 january 1965 29 were in storage at sbama ( three at vafb , one at each of five bases , one at lowry , and 20 in storage at sbama elsewhere ) the 83 surplus missiles remained in inventory at mira loma afs . it did not make economic sense to refurbish them as sm-65 atlas missiles with similar payload capacities had already been converted to satellite launchers . about 33 were distributed to museums , parks and schools as static displays ( see list below ) . the remaining 50 missiles were scrapped at mira loma afs near san bernardino , ca ; the last was broken up in 1972 , in accordance with the salt-i treaty of 1 february 1972 . by november 1965 the air force logistics command had determined that the cost of modifying the widely dispersed sites to support other ballistic missiles was prohibitive , and attempts were made to find new uses . clemmer , wilbur e.1966 , phase-out of the atlas e and f and titan i weapon systems , wright-patterson air force base : historical research division air force logistics command , 1962 , p . 28 . by spring 1966 a number of possible uses and users had been identified . by 6 may 1966 the air force wanted to retain 5 titan sites and the general services administration had earmarked 1 for possible use . the usaf removed equipment it had uses for , the rest was offered to other government agencies . clemmer , wilbur e.1966 , phase-out of the atlas e and f and titan i weapon systems , wright-patterson air force base : historical research division air force logistics command , 1962 , p . 31 . eventually no sites were retained and all were salvaged . the chosen method was the service and salvage contract , which required the contractor to remove the equipment the government wanted before proceeding with scrapping . clemmer , wilbur e.1966 , phase-out of the atlas e and f and titan i weapon systems , wright-patterson air force base : historical research division air force logistics command , 1962 , p . 49 . this accounts for the varied degree of salvage at the sites today . most are sealed today , with one in colorado that is easily entered but also very unsafe . one is open for tours . most of the athena guidance computers were given to universities . one is in the smithsonian . one remained in use at vandenberg afb until it guided a last thor-agena launch in may 1972 . it had guided over 400 missiles . mcmurran , marshall w . , achieving accuracy a legacy of computers and missiles , p 141 , xlibris corporation , 2008 on 6

nitrogen gas to 60-psi and did not contain any fuel or oxidizer . a follow-up test 6 days later was conducted on a scrapped thor irbm , its remnants reside at the slc-10 museum at vandenberg afb . ”
