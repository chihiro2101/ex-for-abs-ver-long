'' block now invites plog and the actors to shelter from the plague in his castle . when they encounter skat and lisa in the forest , she returns to plog , while skat fakes a remorseful suicide . as the group moves on , skat climbs a tree to spend the night , but death appears beneath and cuts down the tree . meeting the condemned woman being drawn to execution , block asks her to summon satan so he can question him about god . the girl claims she has done so , but the knight only sees her terror and gives her herbs to take away her pain as she is placed on the pyre . they encounter raval , stricken by the plague . jöns stops the servant girl from uselessly bringing him water , and raval dies alone . jof tells his wife that he can see the knight playing chess with death and decides to flee with his family , while block knowingly keeps death occupied . as death states '' no one escapes me '' , block knocks the chess pieces over but death restores them to their place . on the next move , death wins the game and announces that when they meet again , it will be the last time for all . death then asks block if he achieved the '' meaningful deed '' he wished to accomplish and the knight replies that he has . block is reunited with his wife and the party shares a final supper , interrupted by death 's arrival . the rest of the party then introduce themselves , and the mute servant girl greets him with '' it is finished . '' jof and his family have sheltered in their caravan from a violent storm , which he interprets as the angel of death passing by . in the morning , jof 's second sight allows him to see the knight and his companions being led away over the hillside in a wild dance of death . cast . gunnar björnstrand – jöns , squire bengt ekerot – death nils poppe – jof max von sydow – antonius block , knight bibi andersson – mia , jof 's wife inga landgré – karin , block 's wife åke fridell – blacksmith plog inga gill – lisa , blacksmith 's wife erik strandmark – jonas skat bertil anderberg – raval , the thief gunnel lindblom – mute girl maud hansson – witch gunnar olsson – albertus pictor , church painter anders ek – the monk benkt-åke benktsson – merchant gudrun brost – maid lars lind – young monk tor borong – farmer harry asklund – inn keeper ulf johanson – jack 's leader ( uncredited ) . production . ingmar bergman originally wrote the play trämålning ( wood painting ) in 1953 / 1954 for the acting students of malmö city theatre . its first public performance , which he directed , was on radio in 1954 . he also directed it on stage in malmö the next spring , and in the autumn it was staged in stockholm , directed by bengt ekerot , who would later play the character death in the film version . det sjunde inseglet – pressreaktion & kommentar svensk filmografi ( in swedish ) . swedish film institute . retrieved on 17 august 2009 . in his autobiography , the magic lantern , bergman wrote that '' wood painting gradually became the seventh seal , an uneven film which lies close to my heart , because it was made under difficult circumstances in a surge of vitality and delight .

'' death , impersonating the confessional priest , refuses to reply . similarly , later , as he eats the strawberries with the family of actors , antonius block states : '' faith is a torment – did you know that ? it is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears , no matter how loudly you call . '' melvyn bragg notes that the concept of the '' silence of god '' in the face of evil , or the pleas of believers or would-be-believers , may be influenced by the punishments of silence meted out by bergman 's father , a chaplain in the state lutheran church . in bergman 's original radio play sometimes translated as a painting on wood , the figure of death in a dance of death is represented not by an actor , but by silence , '' mere nothingness , mere absence.terrifying.the void . '' martin esslin . mediations : essays on brecht , beckett and the media . abacus . london . 1980 . p . 181 . some of the powerful influences on the film were picasso 's picture of the two acrobats , carl orff 's carmina burana , strindberg 's dramas folkungasagan ( '' the saga of the folkung kings '' ) and to damascus , the frescoes at härkeberga church , and a painting by albertus pictor in täby church . just prior to shooting , bergman directed for radio the play everyman by hugo von hofmannsthal . by this time he had also directed plays by shakespeare , strindberg , camus , chesterton , anouilh , tennessee williams , pirandello , lehár , molière and ostrovsky . the actors bibi andersson ( with whom bergman was in a relationship from 1955 to 1959 ) who played the juggler 's wife mia , and max von sydow , whose role as the knight was the first of many star parts he would bring to bergman 's films and whose rugged nordic dignity became a vital resource within bergman 's '' troupe '' of key actors , höök , marianne , ingmar bergman , wahlström & widstrand , stockholm , 1962 p.115f both made a strong impact on the mood and style of the film . bergman grew up in a home infused with an intense christianity , his father being a charismatic rector ( this may have explained bergman 's adolescent infatuation with hitler , which later deeply tormented him ) . as a six-year-old child , bergman used to help the gardener carry corpses from the royal hospital sophiahemmet ( where his father was chaplain ) to the mortuary . when as a boy he saw the film black beauty , the fire scene excited him so much he stayed in bed for three days with a temperature . despite living a bohemian lifestyle in partial rebellion against his upbringing , bergman often signed his scripts with the initials '' s.d.g '' ( soli deo gloria ) — '' to god alone the glory '' — just as j . & nbsp ; s . & nbsp ; bach did at the end of every musical composition . gerald mast writes : '' like the gravedigger in hamlet , the squire . treats death as a bitter and hopeless joke . since we all play chess with death , and since we all must suffer through that hopeless joke , the only question about the game is how long it will last and how well we will play it . to play it well , to live , is to love and not to hate the body and the mortal as the church urges in bergman 's metaphor . '' gerald mast a short history of the movies . p . 405 . melvyn bragg writes : '' it is constructed like an argument . it is a story told as a sermon might be delivered : an allegory.each scene is at once so simple and so charged and layered that it catches us again and again.somehow all of bergman 's own past , that of his father , that of his reading and doing and seeing , that of his swedish culture , of his political burning and religious melancholy , poured into a series of pictures which carry that swell of contributions and contradictions so effortlessly that you could tell the story to a child , publish it as a storybook of photographs and yet know that the deepest questions of religion and the most mysterious revelation of simply being alive are both addressed . '' the jesuit publication america identifies it as having begun '' a series of seven films that explored the possibility of faith in a post-holocaust , nuclear age '' . likewise , film historians thomas w . bohn and richard l . stromgren identify this film as beginning '' his cycle of films dealing with the conundrum of religious faith '' . . reception . upon its original swedish release , the seventh seal was met with a somewhat divided critical response ; its cinematography was widely praised , while '' bergman the scriptwriter was lambasted . '' swedish journalist and critic nils beyer , writing for morgon-tidningen , compared it to carl theodor dreyer 's the passion of joan of arc and day of wrath . while finding dreyer 's films to be superior , he still noted that '' it is n't just any director that you feel like comparing to the old danish master . '' he also praised the usage of the cast , in particular max von sydow , whose character he described as '' a pale , serious don quixote character with a face as if sculpted in wood '' , and '' bibi andersson , who appears as if painted in faded watercolours but still can emit small delicious glimpses of female warmth . '' hanserik hjertén for arbetaren started his review by praising the cinematography , but soon went on to describe the film as '' a horror film for children '' and said that beyond the superficial , it is mostly reminiscent of bergman 's '' sophomoric films from the 40s . '' bergman 's international reputation , on the other hand , was largely cemented by the seventh seal . bosley crowther had only positive things to say in his 1958 review for the new york times , and praised how the themes were elevated by the cinematography and performances : '' the profundities of the ideas are lightened and made flexible by glowing pictorial presentation of action that is interesting and strong . mr . bergman uses his camera and actors for sharp , realistic effects . '' the film is now regarded as a masterpiece of cinema . the village voice ranked the seventh seal at number 33 in its top 250 '' best films of the century '' list in 1999 , based on a poll of critics . the film was included in '' the new york times guide to the best 1,000 movies ever made '' in 2002 . empire magazine , in 2010 , ranked it the eighth-greatest film of world cinema . in a poll held by the same magazine , it was voted 335th 'greatest movie of all time ' from a list of 500 . in addition , on the 100th anniversary of cinema in 1995 , the vatican included the seventh seal in its list of its 45 '' great films '' for its thematic values . in 2012 , the film ranked 93rd on critic 's poll and 75th on director 's poll in sight & sound magazine 's 100 greatest films of all time list . in 2018 the film was ranked 30th in bbc 's list of the 100 greatest foreign language films . the film was selected as the swedish entry for the best foreign language film at the 30th academy awards , but was not nominated . on rotten tomatoes , the film holds an approval rating of 93 % based on 54 reviews , with an average rating of 9.1/10 . the website 's critical consensus reads : '' narratively bold and visually striking , the seventh seal brought ingmar bergman to the world stage – and remains every bit as compelling today '' . on metacritic , the film has a rating of 88/100 based on 15 reviews , indicating '' universal acclaim '' . . influence . the seventh seal significantly helped bergman in gaining his position as a world-class director . when the film won the special jury prize at the 1957 cannes film festival , the attention generated by it ( along with the previous year 's smiles of a summer night ) made bergman and his stars max von sydow and bibi andersson well known to the european film community , and the critics and readers of cahiers du cinéma , among others , discovered him with this movie . within five years of this , he had established himself as the first real auteur of swedish cinema . with its images and reflections upon death and the meaning of life , the seventh seal had a symbolism that was '' immediately apprehensible to people trained in literary culture who were just beginning to discover the 'art ' of film , and it quickly became a staple of high school and college literature courses . unlike hollywood 'movies , ' the seventh seal clearly was aware of elite artistic culture and thus was readily appreciated by intellectual audiences . '' . film and television . the representation of death as a white-faced man who wears a dark cape and plays chess with mortals has been a popular object of parody in other films and television . several films and comedy sketches portray death as playing games other than or in addition to chess . in the final scene of the 1968 film de düva ( mock swedish for '' the dove '' ) , a 15-minute pastiche of bergman 's work generally and his wild strawberries in particular , the protagonist plays badminton against death , and wins when the droppings of a passing dove strike death in the eye . the photography imitates throughout the style of bergman 's cinematographers sven nykvist and gunnar fischer . remembering de düva ( the dove ) , a 30 july 2007 slate article there are two scenes in monty python 's '' meaning of life '' that parody the film . death enters a home where the occupants are at a dinner party , taken from the scene at the knight 's castle . then the guests , now deceased , all enter their cars , and follow death in a line , similar to the iconic '' dance of death '' on the ridge . popular music . the film is referenced in several songs . the plot is recapitulated in scott walker 's '' the seventh seal '' from his album scott 4 . genius.com there is a passing reference in bruce cockburn 's song '' how i spent my fall vacation '' , from his album humans , in which the song 's narrative is bracketed by two young men watching the film in a cinema . on iron maiden 's album dance of death ( 2003 ) , the title track was inspired by the final scene of the seventh seal where , according to guitarist janick gers , '' these figures on the horizon start doing a little jig , which is the dance of death .
