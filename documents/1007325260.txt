strategies for low emission vehicles ? , 2004 oecd publishing – p . 166 . lng – liquefied natural gas . in april 2012 iveco presented its first vehicle with this technology , the stralis lng . as opposed to vehicles with cng technology , lng technology takes the vehicle farther on a full tank ( up to 750km ) and reduces the vehicle 's tare thus increasing the load . the main difference between the two technologies lies in the type of natural gas storage employed , which in this case is kept in a liquid state at −161°c in cryogenic tanks ; it is then heated in a heat exchanger so that once it reaches the engine it is a gas . also , the noise emitted decreases by 3 to 6 decibels over an analogous diesel engine vehicle . . iveco trakker bifuel – diesel-ethanol prototype . iveco created the first prototype of a bifuel , diesel and ethanol-run vehicle . the technology was developed by iveco together with fpt industrial and bosch . the prototype uses a trakker truck with common rail cursor9 engine with 360hp that may be powered by a 40–60 % ethanol-diesel blend . the prototype was tested by raízen , a joint venture between the cane sugar producer cosan and shell . in 2011 , this prototype earned iveco the '' prêmio top etanol '' – for the alternative fuel technology . . heating and air-conditioning systems . a prototype of a heat pump system for electric and hybrid vehicles was installed on the iveco daily vehicle . the system cools or heats the passenger compartment by transferring low temperature heat generated by the drive systems . at the same time , the control strategies minimise the energy demand in order to achieve a low impact on consumption . . iveco vehicles . current models . iveco iveco daily iveco eurocargo iveco trakker iveco s-way iveco stralis iveco stralis iveco powerstar iveco strator iveco tector iveco acco iveco 682 iveco bus iveco urbanway iveco crealis iveco crossway iveco evadys iveco magelys iveco daily . major sponsorships . iveco has in the past sponsored many major professional boxing events , including , in each case , the first of two fights between sugar ray leonard and tommy hearns and between aaron pryor and alexis arguello . . photos . file:2014 iveco daily 35 s13 mwb 2.3.jpg 2014 iveco daily 35 s13 van file:2019 iveco s-way in madrid.jpg 2019 iveco s-way file : iveco eurocargo 2015.jpg 2015 iveco eurocargo file : iveco tector 8 e 11 toneladas.jpg 2017 iveco tector file : iveco 682 truck.jpg 2018 iveco 682 file : ivecostralisallblacksvysokemyto.jpg 2007 iveco stralis file : iveco trakker 310 f.jpg 2016 iveco trakker file : iveco evadys n°8288 ( vue avant gauche ) - transisère ( lumbin ) . jpg 2016 iveco bus evadys file : crossway 937.jpg 2017 iveco bus crossway file : iveco stralis x-way as440x46tp np - front and right side iaa 2018.jpg 2018 iveco stralis x-way
