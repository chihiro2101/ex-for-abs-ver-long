Tiger II

reliability and mobility . early tiger iis proved unreliable , owing principally to leaking seals and gaskets , and an overburdened drive train originally intended for a lighter vehicle . jentz and doyle 1993 , p . 34 the double radius steering gear was initially particularly prone to failure . jentz and doyle 1993 , p . 11 lack of crew training could amplify this problem ; drivers originally given only limited training on other tanks were often sent directly to operational units already on their way to the front . the schwere heeres panzer abteilung 501 ( s.h.pz.abt . 501 ) arrived on the eastern front with only eight out of 45 tanks operational ; these faults were mostly due to drive-train failures . the first five tiger iis delivered to the panzer lehr division broke down before they could be used in combat , and were destroyed to prevent capture . jentz and doyle 1993 , p . 35 . the introduction of modified seals , gaskets and drive train components , as well as improved driver training and sufficient maintenance improved the tank 's mechanical reliability . jentz and doyle 1993 , p . 18 . statistics from 15 march 1945 show reliability rates of 59 percent for the tiger , almost equal to the 62 percent of the panzer iv and better than the 48 percent of the panther that were operational by this period . notwithstanding its initial reliability problems , the tiger ii was remarkably agile for such a heavy vehicle . contemporary german records and testing results indicate that its tactical mobility was as good as or better than most german or allied tanks . jentz and doyle 1993 , pp . 33–34 . . combat history . the first combat use of the tiger ii was by the 1st company of the 503rd heavy panzer battalion ( s.h.pz.abt . 503 ) during the operation overlord , opposing operation atlantic between troarn and demouville on 18 july 1944 . two were lost in combat , while the company commander 's tank became irrecoverably trapped after falling into a bomb crater created during operation goodwood . schneider 2000 , p . 133 . on the eastern front , it was first used on 12 august 1944 by the 501st heavy panzer battalion ( s.h.pz.abt . 501 ) resisting the lvov–sandomierz offensive . it attacked the soviet bridgehead over the vistula river near baranów sandomierski . on the road to oględów , three tiger iis were destroyed in an ambush by a few t-34 . zaloga 1994 , p . 14 . because these german tanks suffered ammunition explosions , which caused many crew fatalities , main gun rounds were no longer allowed to be stowed within the turret , reducing capacity to 68 . schneider 2000 , p . 46 . up to fourteen tiger iis of the 501st were destroyed or captured in the area between 11 and 14 august to ambushes and flank attacks by both soviet t-34-85 and is-2 tanks , and isu-122 assault guns in inconvenient sandy terrain . the capture of three operational tiger iis allowed the soviets to conduct tests at kubinka and to evaluate its strengths and weaknesses sledgehammers : strengths and flaws of tiger tank battalions in world war ii . christopher w . wilbeck . aberjona , 2004 . p.135 on 15 october 1944 , tiger iis of 503rd heavy panzer battalion played a crucial role during operation panzerfaust , supporting otto skorzeny 's troops in taking the hungarian capital of budapest , which ensured that the country remained with the axis until the end of the war . the 503rd then took part in the battle of debrecen . the 503rd remained in the hungarian theater of operations for 166 days , during which it accounted for at least 121 soviet tanks , 244 anti-tank guns and artillery pieces , five aircraft and a train . this was set against the loss of 25 tiger iis ; ten were knocked out by soviet troops and burned out , two were sent back to vienna for a factory overhaul , while thirteen were blown up by their crews for various reasons , usually to prevent them from falling into enemy hands . kurt knispel , the highest scoring tank ace of all time ( 162 enemy armoured fighting vehicles destroyed ) , also served with the 503rd , and was killed in action on 29 april 1945 in his tiger ii . számvéber , 2000 . p . 147 . the tiger ii was also used in significant numbers , distributed into four heavy panzer battalions , during the ardennes offensive ( also known as the battle of the bulge ) of december 1944 . schneider 2005 , pp . 214–216 . at least 150 tiger iis were present , nearly a third of total production , and most were lost during the course of the offensive . green , michael . '' german tanks of world war ii '' . may 14 , 2000 . page 73 . some tiger iis were also present during the soviet vistula–oder schneider 2000 , p . 47 . and east prussian offensives in january 1945 , schneider 2000 , pp . 89–91 . as well as the german lake balaton offensive in hungary in march 1945 , schneider 2005 , p . 217 . the battle of the seelow heights in april 1945 , and the battle of berlin at the end of the war . schneider 2005 , pp . 300–303 . on 12 january 1945 , a column of tiger iis among other tanks from 524th heavy panzer battalion were involved in a short-range engagement with t-34 85 tanks near the village of lisow , with the germans leaving behind 5 tiger iis , 7 tiger is and 5 panthers for the loss of 4 t-34 85 tanks burnt out . the germans claimed they had destroyed 50-60 is-2s even though no is-2 tanks were present . the 103rd ss heavy panzer battalion ( s.ss pz.abt . 503 ) claimed approximately 500 kills in the period from january to april 1945 on the eastern front for the loss of 45 tiger iis ( most of which were abandoned and destroyed by their own crews after mechanical breakdowns or for lack of fuel ) . schneider 2005 , pp . 304 , 324 . . gun and armour performance . the heavy armour and powerful long-range gun gave the tiger ii an advantage against all opposing western allied and soviet tanks attempting to engage it from head on . this was especially true on the western front where , until the arrival of the few m26 pershings in 1945 and the few m4 sherman upgrades that were scattered around europe after d-day , as well as a few late churchill models , neither the british nor us forces brought heavy tanks into service . a wa prüf 1 report estimated that the tiger ii 's frontal aspect was impervious to the 122 & nbsp ; mm d-25t , the largest calibre tank gun of ww2 . however , soviet testing contradicted this as they found that the frontal glacis could be destroyed by firing 3-4 shots at the weld joints from the ranges of 500-600m which were found to be inferior in quality to that of previous german designs like the tiger i or panther . on the other hand , an r.a.c 3.d . document of february 1945 estimated that the british ordnance qf 17-pounder gun , using armour-piercing discarding sabot shot was theoretically capable of penetrating the front of the tiger ii 's turret and nose ( lower front hull ) at respectively although , given the lack of a stated angle , this was presumably at the ideal 90 degrees and in combat the tiger ii was never penetrated frontally by the qf 17-pounder . jentz and doyle , 1993 , pp 34–36 as a result of its thick frontal armour , flanking manoeuvres were most often used against the tiger ii to attempt a shot at the thinner side and rear armour , giving a tactical advantage to the tiger ii in most engagements . jarymowycz 2001 , p . 274 . moreover , the main armament of the tiger ii was capable of knocking out any allied tank frontally at ranges exceeding , well beyond the effective range of allied tank guns . jarymowycz 2001 , p . 258 . . soviet wartime testing . during august 1944 , two tiger ausf b tanks were captured by the soviets near sandomierz , and were soon moved to the testing grounds at kubinka . during the transfer , the two tanks suffered from various mechanical breakdowns ; the cooling system was insufficient for the excessively hot weather , where the engine tended to overheat and cause a consequential failure of the gearbox . the right suspension of one of the tanks had to be completely replaced , and its full functionality could not be re-established . the tank broke down again every 10–15 & nbsp ; km . the 8.8 cm kwk 43 gave positive results in penetration and accuracy , which were on par with the 122 & nbsp ; mm d-25t . it proved capable of passing completely through its '' colleague '' , a tiger ausf b 's turret at a range of 400 m . the armour of one vehicle was tested by firing at it with shells between 100 and 152 & nbsp ; mm calibre . the welding was , despite careful workmanship , significantly worse than on similar designs . as a result , even when shells did not penetrate the armour , there was often a large amount of spalling from the inside of the plates , which damaged the transmission and rendered the tank inoperable . further testing showed that the armour plate itself exhibited deficiencies in quality compared to earlier german tanks such as the tiger i and panther . lab testing found that the armour plates lacked molybdenum ( ascribed to a loss of supply , being replaced by vanadium ) , resulting in low malleability . der riesige deutsche „ königstiger “ war ein irrweg von sven felix kellerhoff . veröffentlicht am 07.07.2014 the expanded firing test states that the ар projectiles from the 100 mm bs-3 and 122 mm a-19 gun penetrated a tiger ausf b 's turret at ranges of 1000–1500 metres , which suggests a quality factor of 0.86 for the tiger ausf b 's turret . the firing test against the tiger b turret front , however , was conducted after removal of the gun and mantlet , and resulted in penetrations close to armour openings , such as vision slits and gun location . the penetrations to the right gun opening were influenced by previous 100 & nbsp ; mm projectile penetration hits or armour damage . the 100 mm bs-3 and 122 mm a-19 could also penetrate the weld joints of the front hull at ranges of 500–600 metres after 3–4 shots . . surviving vehicles . before being transferred to the museum in 1975 . believed to have carried turret number 123 , colonel michel aubry , the founder of the museum , decided to put 233 on the turret in honour of the tiger ii that destroyed his sherman tank at the end of the war . unlike other captured german vehicles , this tiger ii was never used by the french army . other survivors include : the tank museum , dorset , uk . tiger ii with early production turret is on display . this vehicle was the second soft steel prototype made and did not see active service . this tiger ii 's engine was removed for use in the restoration of tiger 131 , the only working example of a tiger i . this item is currently on display at nationaal

( production turret ) . this vehicle was from s.ss pz.abt . 501 , with hull number 280093 , turret number 104 , and has a comprehensive coating of zimmerit . jentz and doyle 1997 , p.108 . it was claimed by sergeant roberts of a squadron , 23rd hussars , 11th armoured division in a sherman tank near beauvais , although it had already been disabled and abandoned by its crew following damage to its tracks and final drive . schneider 2005 , p . 212 . there is a photograph showing this vehicle after its final action in a beet field with its turret turned 90° . this item is currently on display
