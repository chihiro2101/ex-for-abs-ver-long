Bug-out bag

terminology . the term '' bug-out bag '' is related to , and possibly derived from , the '' bail-out bag '' emergency kit many military aviators carry . in the united states , the term refers to the korean war practice of the u.s . army designating alternative defensive positions , in the event that the units had to retreat . they were directed to '' bug out '' when being overrun was imminent . the term has since been adopted by military training institutions around the world , with standard operating procedures involving a bug out location , a method of withdrawal , and the bare supplies needed to withdraw quickly but still survive in the field . the concept passed into wide usage among other military and law enforcement personnel , though the '' bail-out bag '' is as likely to include emergency gear for going into an emergency situation as for escaping an emergency . the term go-kit is popular in the amateur radio service , especially in the amateur radio emergency service ( ares ) and radio amateur civil emergency service ( races ) communities , and describes a combination personal bug-out bag and portable amateur radio station . a personal go-kit generally takes some combination of units : a '' one-day '' ( or '' 24 hour '' ) kit , a '' three day '' ( or '' 72 hour '' ) kit that adds additional supplies , or a '' one week kit '' that adds yet additional personal items to the three-day kit . any or all supports deploying the operator plus his or her privately owned self-contained radio communications setup . rationale . the primary purpose of a bug-out bag is to allow one to evacuate quickly if a disaster should strike . it is therefore prudent to gather into a single place all of the materials and supplies that might be required to do this , such as a bag or a few storage containers . the recommendation that a bug-out bag contain enough supplies for 72 hours arises from advice from organizations responsible for disaster relief and management that it may take them up to 72 hours to reach people affected by a disaster and offer help . the bag 's contents may vary according to the region of the user , as someone evacuating from the path of a hurricane may have different supplies from someone who lives in an area prone to blizzards , earthquakes , or wildfires . in addition to allowing one to survive a disaster evacuation , a bug-out bag may also be used when sheltering in place as a response to emergencies such as blackouts , house fires , tornadoes , and other severe natural disasters . some survivalists also recommend keeping a get me home kit in the car and/or at work . this is a kit to enable a person to get back home from work in an emergency where all transport cars and public transport have broken down . it is designed around personal circumstances where , for example , a walk of 25 kilometres might be required from work to home . the get me home kit can include , for example , enough water to get home , suitable walking shoes , a map ( not electronic ) , enough food for 12 hours , clothing for adverse weather , etc . typical contents . the suggested contents of a bug-out bag vary , but most of the following
