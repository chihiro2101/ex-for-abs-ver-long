Ahnentafel

inductive reckoning . to find out what someone 's number would be without compiling a list , one must first trace how they relate back to the subject or person of interest , meaning one records that someone is the subject 's father 's mother 's mother 's father 's father 's & nbsp ; . once one has done that , one can use two methods . first method . use the definition that a father 's number will be twice that individual 's number , or a mother 's will be twice plus one , and just multiply and add 1 accordingly . for instance , someone can find out what number sophia of hanover would be on an ahnentafel of peter phillips . she is phillips 's mother 's mother 's father 's father 's father 's mother 's father 's father 's father 's father 's father 's mother . so , we multiply and add : :1 & times ; 2 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; 1 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 3 : :3 & times ; 2 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; 1 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 7 : ::7 & times ; 2 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 14 : : : :14 & times ; 2 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 28 : : : ::28 & times ; 2 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 56 : : : : : :56 & times ; 2 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; 1 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 113 : : : : : ::113 & times ; 2 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 226 : : : : : : : :226 & times ; 2 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 452 : : : : : : : ::452 & times ; 2 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 904 : : : : : : : : : :904 & times ; 2 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 1808 : : : : : : : : : ::1808 & times ; 2 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 3616 : : : : : : : : : : : :3616 & times ; 2 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; 1 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 7233 thus , if we were to make an ahnentafel for peter phillips , electress sophia would be 7233 . second method . write down the digit '' 1 '' , which represents the subject , then from left to right write '' 0 '' for each father and '' 1 '' for each mother in the relation , ending with the ancestor of interest . the result will be the binary representation of the ancestor 's ahnentafel number . then convert the binary number to decimal form . using the sophia example : : sophia peter 's mother 's mother 's father 's father 's father 's mother 's father 's father 's father 's father 's father 's mother : sophia 1110001000001 :1110001000001 1×4096 + 1×2048 + 1×1024 + 0×512 + 0×256 + 0×128 + 1×64 + 0×32 + 0×16 + 0×8 + 0×4 + 0×2 + 1×1 : sophia 7233 . deductive reckoning . we can also work in reverse to find what the relation is from the number . reverse first method . one starts out by seeing if the number is odd or even . if it is odd , the last part of the relation is '' mother , '' so subtract 1 and divide by 2 . if it is even , the last part is '' father , '' and one divides by 2 . repeat steps 2–3 , and build back from the last word . once one gets to 1 , one is done . on an ahnentafel of prince william , john wark is number 116 . we follow the steps : . calculation of the generation number . the generation number can be calculated as the logarithm to base 2 of the ahnentafel number , and rounding down to a full integer by truncating decimal digits . for example , the number 38 is between 2 5 32 and 2 6 64 , so log 2 ( 38 ) is between 5 and 6 . this means that ancestor no.38 belongs to generation five , and was a great-great-great-grandparent of the reference person who is no.1 ( generation zero ) . example . the example , shown below , is an ahnentafel of prince william , duke of cambridge , listing all of his ancestors up to his fourth great-grandparents . prince william , duke of cambridge ( born 21 june 1982 ) charles , prince of wales ( born 14 november 1948 ) diana , princess of wales ( 1 july 1961 – 31 august 1997 ) prince philip , duke of edinburgh ( born 10 june 1921 ) elizabeth ii , queen of the united kingdom et al .

the same information in a tree : . multiple numbers for the same person . an ancestor may have two or more numbers due to pedigree collapse . for example in the above ahnentafel for prince william , queen victoria is both no.79 and no.81 . she is no.79 because she was the great-great-grandmother of william 's grandfather prince philip , and she is also no.81 because she was the great-great-grandmother of william 's grandmother queen elizabeth ii . the relationships are easier to follow using the ancestry tree with ahnentafel numbering . other german definitions . european nobility took pride in displaying their descent . in the german language , the term '' ahnentafel '' may refer to a list of coats of arms and names of one 's ancestors , even when it does not follow the numbered tabular representation given above . in this case the german '' tafel '' is taken literally to be a physical '' display board '' instead of an abstract scheme . in nazi germany , the law for the restoration of the professional civil service required a person to prove non-jewish ancestry with an ariernachweis ( aryan certificate ) . the certificate could take the form of entries in the permanent ahnenpass ( that was sorted according to the ahnentafel numbering system ) or as entries in a singular arierschein ( aryan attestation ) that was titled '' ahnentafel '' . software . see
