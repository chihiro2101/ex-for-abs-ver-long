Douglas DC-3

design and development . '' dc '' stands for '' douglas commercial '' . the dc-3 was the culmination of a development effort that began after an inquiry from trans world airlines ( twa ) to donald douglas . twa 's rival in transcontinental air service , united airlines , was starting service with the boeing 247 and boeing refused to sell any 247s to other airlines until united 's order for 60 aircraft had been filled . o'leary 1992 , p . 7 . twa asked douglas to design and build an aircraft that would allow twa to compete with united . douglas ' design , the 1933 dc-1 , was promising , and led to the dc-2 in 1934 . the dc-2 was a success , but there was room for improvement . the dc-3 resulted from a marathon telephone call from american airlines ceo c . r . smith to donald douglas , when smith persuaded a reluctant douglas to design a sleeper aircraft based on the dc-2 to replace american 's curtiss condor ii biplanes . the dc-2 's cabin was wide , too narrow for side-by-side berths . douglas agreed to go ahead with development only after smith informed him of american 's intention to purchase twenty aircraft . the new aircraft was engineered by a team led by chief engineer arthur e . raymond over the next two years , and the prototype dst ( douglas sleeper transport ) first flew on december 17 , 1935 ( the 32nd anniversary of the wright brothers ' flight at kitty hawk ) with douglas chief test pilot carl cover at the controls . its cabin was wide , and a version with 21 seats instead of the 14–16 sleeping berths berths were long ; lowers were wide and uppers were . of the dst was given the designation dc-3 . there was no prototype dc-3 , and the first dc-3 built followed seven dsts off the production line for delivery to american airlines . pearcy 1987 , p . 17 . the dc-3 and dst popularized air travel in the united states . eastbound transcontinental flights could cross the u.s . in about 15 hours with three refueling stops while westbound trips against the wind took hours . a few years earlier such a trip entailed short hops in slower and shorter-range aircraft during the day , transcontinental air transport . o'leary 2006 , p . 54 . a variety of radial engines were offered for the dc-3 . early-production civilian aircraft used either the nine-cylinder wright r-1820 cyclone or the fourteen-cylinder pratt & whitney r-1830 twin wasp , but the twin wasp was chosen for most military versions and was also used by most dc-3s converted from military service . five dc-3s super dc-3s with pratt & whitney r-2000 twin wasps were built in the late 1940s , three of which entered airline service . production . total production including all military variants was 16,079 . gradidge 2006 , p . 20 . more than 400 remained in commercial service in 1998 . production was as follows : 607 civil variants of the dc-3 ; 10,048 military c-47 and c-53 derivatives built at santa monica , california , long beach , california , and oklahoma city ; 4,937 built under license in the soviet union ( 1939–1950 ) as the lisunov li-2 ( nato reporting name : cab ) ; 487 mitsubishi kinsei-engined aircraft built by showa and nakajima in japan ( 1939–1945 ) , as the showa/nakajima l2d ( allied codename tabby ) . production of dsts ended in mid-1941 and civil dc-3 production ended in early 1943 , although dozens of the dsts and dc-3s ordered by airlines that were produced between 1941 and 1943 were pressed into the us military service while still on the production line . pearcy 1987 , p . 76 pearcy 1987 , pp . 69–117 military versions were produced until the end of the war in 1945 . a larger , more powerful super dc-3 was launched in 1949 to positive reviews . the civilian market was flooded with second-hand c-47s , many of which were converted to passenger and cargo versions . only five super dc-3s were built , and three of them were delivered for commercial use . the prototype super dc-3 served the us navy with the designation yc-129 alongside 100 r4ds that had been upgraded to the super dc-3 specification . turboprop conversions . from the early 1950s , some dc-3s were modified to use rolls-royce dart engines , as in the conroy turbo three . other conversions featured armstrong siddeley mamba or pratt & whitney pt6a turbines . the greenwich aircraft corp dc-3-tp is a conversion with an extended fuselage and with pratt & whitney canada pt6 engines fitted . turbo dakota dc-3 '' turbine conversion aircraft '' . dodson.com . retrieved september 12 , 2012 .
