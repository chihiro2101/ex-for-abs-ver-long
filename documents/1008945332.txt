History of Crete

prehistoric crete . in 2002 , the paleontologist gerard gierlinski discovered what he claimed were fossil footprints left by ancient human relatives 5,600,000 years ago , but the claim is controversial . excavations in south crete in 2008–2009 revealed stone tools at least 130,000 years old . team led by pc faculty member finds evidence of earliest seafaring by human ancestors , providence college . strasser f . thomas et al .

cultural records are written in the undeciphered script known as '' linear a '' . the archaeological record of crete includes superb palaces , houses , roads , paintings and sculptures . early neolithic settlements in crete include knossos and trapeza . for the earlier times , radiocarbon dating of organic remains and charcoal offers some dates . based on this , it is thought that crete was inhabited from about 130,000 years ago , in the lower paleolithic , hemingway , seán , art of the aegean bronze age , p . 25 , the metropolitan museum of art bulletin , spring 2012 volume lxix , number 4 perhaps not continuously , with a neolithic farming culture from the 7th millennium bc onwards . the first settlers introduced cattle , sheep , goats , pigs , and dogs , as well as domesticated cereals and legumes . the native fauna of crete included pygmy hippo , dwarf elephant paleoloxodon chaniensis , dwarf deer praemegaceros cretensis , giant mice kritimys catreus , and insectivores as well as badger , beech marten and lutrogale cretensis , a kind of terrestrial otter . large mammalian carnivores were lacking ; in their stead , the flightless cretan owl was the apex predator . most of these animals died out at the end of the last ice-age . humans played a part in this extinction , which occurred on other medium to large mediterranean islands as well ; , for example , on cyprus , sicily and majorca . remains of a settlement found under the bronze age palace at knossos date to the 7th millennium bc . up to now , knossos remains the only aceramic site . the settlement covered approximately 350,000 square metres . the sparse animal bones contain the above-mentioned domestic species as well as deer , badger , marten and mouse : the extinction of the local megafauna had not left much game behind . neolithic pottery is known from knossos , lera cave and gerani cave . the late neolithic sees a proliferation of sites , pointing to a population increase . in the late neolithic , the donkey and the rabbit were introduced to the island ; deer and agrimi were hunted . the kri-kri , a feral goat , preserves traits of the early domesticates . horse , fallow deer and hedgehog are only attested from minoan times onwards . minoan civilization and mycenaean period . crete was the centre of europe 's most ancient civilization , the minoans . tablets inscribed in linear a have been found in numerous sites in crete , and a few in the aegean islands . the minoans established themselves in many islands besides ancient crete : secure identifications of minoan off-island sites include kea , kythera , milos , rhodes , and above all , thera ( santorini ) . because of a lack of written records , estimates of the minoan chronology are based on well-established minoan pottery styles , which can at points be tied to egyptian and ancient near eastern chronologies by finds away from crete and clear influences . archaeologists ever since sir arthur evans have identified and uncovered the palace-complex at knossos , the most famous minoan site . other palace sites in crete such as phaistos have uncovered magnificent stone-built , multi-story palaces containing drainage systems , c.michael hogan , phaistos fieldnotes , the modern antiquarian ( 2007 ) and the queen had a bath and a flushing toilet . the expertise displayed in the hydraulic engineering was of a very high level . there were no defensive walls to the complexes . by the 16th century bc pottery and other remains on the greek mainland show that the minoans had far-reaching contacts on the mainland . in the 16th century a major earthquake caused destruction on crete and on thera that was swiftly repaired . by about the 15th century bc a massive volcanic explosion known as the minoan eruption blew the island of thera apart , casting more than four times the amount of ejecta as the explosion of krakatoa and generating a tsunami in the enclosed aegean that threw pumice up to 250 meters above sea level onto the slopes of anaphi , 27 & nbsp ; km to the east . any fleet along the north shore of crete was destroyed and john chadwick suggests that the majority of cretan fleets had kept the island secure from the greek-speaking mainlanders . the sites , save knossos , were destroyed by fires . mycenaeans from the mainland took over knossos , rebuilding some parts to suit them . they were in turn subsumed by a subsequent dorian migration . iron age and archaic crete . the collapse of the mycenaean civilization was followed by the appearance of the first greek city-states in the 9th century bc and the epics of homer in the 8th century bc . some of the dorian cities that prospered on crete during those times are kydonia , lato , dreros , gortyn and eleutherna . classical and hellenistic crete . in the classical and hellenistic period crete fell into a pattern of combative city-states , harboring pirates . in the late 4th century bc , the aristocratic order began to collapse due to endemic infighting among the elite , and crete 's economy was weakened by prolonged wars between city states . during the 3rd century bc , gortyn , kydonia ( chania ) , lyctus and polyrrhenia challenged the primacy of ancient knossos . while the cities continued to prey upon one another , they invited into their feuds mainland powers like macedon and its rivals rhodes and ptolemaic egypt . in 220 bc the island was tormented by a lyttian war . as a result , the macedonian king philip v gained hegemony over crete which lasted to the end of the cretan war ( 205–200 bc ) , when the rhodes opposed the rise of macedon and the romans started to interfere in cretan affairs . in the 2nd century bc ierapytna ( ierapetra ) gained supremacy on eastern crete . roman , byzantine and arab crete . in 88 bc mithridates vi of pontus on the black sea , went to war to halt the advance of roman hegemony in the aegean . on the pretext that knossos was backing mithradates , marcus antonius creticus attacked crete in 71 bc and was repelled . rome sent quintus caecilius metellus with three legions to the island . after a ferocious three-year campaign crete was conquered for rome in 69 bc , earning this metellus the agnomen '' creticus . '' at the archaeological sites , there seems to be little evidence of widespread damage associated with the transfer to roman power : a single palatial house complex seems to have been razed . gortyn seems to have been pro-roman and was rewarded by being made the capital of the joint province of crete and cyrenaica . gortyn was the site of the largest christian basilica on crete , the basilica of saint titus , dedicated to the first christian bishop in crete , to whom paul addressed one of his epistles . the church was begun in the 1st century . as revealed in the epistle to titus in the new testament and confirmed by cretan poet epimenides , the people of crete were considered to be always liars , evil beasts and gluttons . ( note : epimenides was a poet in the 6th century bc . paul cited him in titus 1:12 . ) crete continued to be part of the eastern roman or byzantine empire , a quiet cultural backwater , until it fell into the hands of iberian muslims under abu hafs in the 820s , who established a emirate of crete on the island . the archbishop cyril of gortyn was killed and the city so thoroughly devastated it was never reoccupied . candia ( chandax , modern heraklion ) , a city built by the iberian muslims , was made capital of the island instead . the emirate of crete became a center of muslim piratical activity in the aegean , and a thorn in byzantium 's side . successive campaigns to recover the island failed until 961 , when nikephoros phokas reconquered crete for the byzantine empire and made it into a theme . panagiotakis , introduction , p . xvi . the byzantines held the island until the fourth crusade ( 1204 ) . in its aftermath , possession of the island was disputed between the genoese and the venetians , with the latter eventually solidifying their control by 1212 . despite frequent revolts by the native population , the venetians retained the island until 1669 , when the ottoman empire took possession of it .

'' égypte/monde arabe 4 ( 2007 ) : 35-54 online . after greece achieved its independence , crete became an object of contention as the christians revolted several times against ottoman rule . revolts in 1841 and 1858 secured some privileges , such as the right to bear arms , equality of christian and muslim worship , and the establishment of christian councils of elders with jurisdiction over education and customary law . despite these concessions , the christian cretans maintained their ultimate aim of union with greece , and tensions between the christian and muslim communities ran high . thus , in 1866 the great cretan revolt began . the uprising , which lasted for three years , involved volunteers from greece and other european countries , where it was viewed with considerable sympathy . despite early successes of the rebels , who quickly confined the ottomans to the northern towns , the uprising failed . the ottoman grand vizier a'ali pasha personally assumed control of the ottoman forces and launched a methodical campaign to retake the rural districts , which was combined with promises of concession ( politics ) , notably by the introduction of an organic law , which gave the cretan christians equal ( in practice , because of their superior numbers , majority ) control of local administration . his approach bore fruits , as the rebel leaders gradually submitted . by early 1869 , the island was again under ottoman control . during the congress of berlin in the summer of 1878 , there was a further rebellion , which was halted quickly by the intervention of the british and the adaptation of the 1867-8 organic law into a constitutional settlement known as the pact of halepa . crete became a semi-independent parliamentary state within the ottoman empire under an ottoman governor who had to be a christian . a number of the senior '' christian pashas '' including photiades pasha and kostis adosidis pasha ruled the island in the 1880s , presiding over a parliament in which liberals and conservatives contended for power . disputes between the two powers led to a further insurgency in 1889 and the collapse of the pact of halepa arrangements . the international powers , disgusted at what seemed to be factional politics , allowed the ottoman authorities to send troops to the island and restore order but did not anticipate that ottoman sultan abdul hamid ii would use this as a pretext to end the halepa pact constitution and instead rule the island by martial law . this action led to international sympathy for the cretan christians and to a loss of any remaining acquiescence among them to continued ottoman rule . when a small insurgency began in september 1895 , it spread quickly , and by the summer of 1896 the ottoman forces had lost military control of most of the island . a new cretan insurrection in 1897 led to the ottoman empire declaring war on greece . however , the great powers ( austria-hungary , france , the german empire , the kingdom of italy , the russian empire and great britain ) decided that the ottoman empire could no longer maintain control and intervened , dispatching a multinational naval force , the international squadron , to cretan waters in february 1897 . the squadron 's senior admirals formed an '' admirals council '' which temporarily governed the island . the international squadron bombarded cretan insurgents , placed sailors and marines ashore , and instituted a blockade of crete and key ports in greece , bringing organized combat on the island to an end by late march 1897 . soldiers from the armies of five of the powers ( germany refused to participate ) then occupied key cities in crete during late march and april 1897 . mctiernan , pp . 13–23 . eventually , the admirals council decided to establish an autonomous state within the ottoman empire on crete . mctiernan , p . 28 . after a violent riot by cretan turks on 6 september 1898 ( 25 august according to the julian calendar then in use on crete , which was 12 days behind the modern gregorian calendar during the 19th century ) , the admirals also decided to expel all ottoman troops from crete , which was accomplished on 6 november 1898 . when prince george of greece arrived in crete on 21 december 1898 ( 9 december according to the julian calendar ) as the first high commissioner of the autonomous cretan state , crete effectively was detached from the ottoman empire , although it remained under the sultan 's suzerainty . mctiernan , pp . 35–39 . . modern crete . cretan state . after the expulsion of ottoman forces in november 1898 , and the autonomous cretan state ( official greek name : κρητική πολιτεία ) , headed by prince george of greece and denmark , was founded under ottoman suzerainty in december 1898 . prince george was replaced by alexandros zaimis in 1906 , and in 1908 , taking advantage of domestic turmoil in turkey as well as the timing of zaimis 's vacation away from the island , the cretan deputies declared union with greece . ion , theodore p . , '' the cretan question , '' the american journal of international law , april , 1910 , pp . 276–284 but this act was not recognized internationally until 1913 after the balkan wars when , by the treaty of london , sultan mehmed v relinquished his formal rights to the island . in december , the greek flag was raised at the firkas fortress in chania , with eleftherios venizelos and king constantine in attendance , and crete was unified with mainland greece . the muslim ( turkish ? ) minority of crete initially remained on the island but was later relocated to turkey under the general population exchange agreed in the 1923 treaty of lausanne between turkey and greece . one of the most important figures to emerge from the end of ottoman crete was the liberal politician eleftherios venizelos , probably the most important statesman of modern greece . venizelos was an athens-trained lawyer who was active in liberal circles in chania , then the cretan capital . after autonomy , he was first a minister in the government of prince george and then his most formidable opponent . in 1910 venizelos transferred his career to athens , quickly became the dominant figure on the political scene and in 1912 , after careful preparations for a military alliance against the ottoman empire with serbia , montenegro , and bulgaria , allowed cretan deputies to take their place in the greek parliament . this was treated as grounds for war by ottoman empire but the balkan allies won a series of sweeping victories in the hostilities that followed ( see balkan wars ) . ottoman empire was effectively defeated in the ensuing war and were forced out of the balkans and thrace by the alliance , except for the borders which turkey continues to hold to this day . world war ii . . battle of greece . in 1939 , the united kingdom guaranteed military aid to greece if its territorial integrity was threatened . joëlle dalègre , op . cit . , p.20 the priority of the united kingdom was to prevent crete from falling into enemy hands , because the island could be used to defend egypt , ( the suez canal and the route to india ) . van creveld , op . cit . , p . 67 . british troops landed on crete with the consent of the greek government from 3 november 1940 , in order to make the 5th greek division of crete available for the albanian front . the invasion of mainland greece by the axis powers began on 6 april 1941 and was complete within a few weeks despite the intervention of the armies of the commonwealth along with greece . king george ii and the government of emmanouil tsouderos were forced to flee athens and took refuge in crete on april 23 . crete was also the refuge of commonwealth troops that fled from the beaches of attica and the peloponnese to crete to organize a new front of resistance . battle of crete . after the conquest of mainland greece , germany turned to crete and the last stage of the balkans campaign . after a fierce and bloody conflict between nazi germany and the allies ( united kingdom , new zealand , australia , and greece ) that lasted ten days ( between the 20 and 31 may 1941 ) , the island fell to the germans . on the morning of 20 may 1941 , crete was the theater of the first major airborne assault in history . the third reich launched an airborne invasion of crete under the code name of '' operation mercury '' . 17,000 paratroopers under the command of general kurt student were dropped at three strategic locations with airfields : maleme , heraklion , and rethymnon . their goal was the capture and control of the three airfields to allow the arrival of reinforcements airlifted by the luftwaffe from mainland greece to bypass the royal navy and the hellenic navy who still controlled the seas . on 1 june 1941 the allies completely evacuated the island of crete . despite the victory of the german invaders , the elite german paratroopers suffered such heavy losses , from the resistance of the allied troops and civilians , that adolf hitler forbade further airborne operations of such large scale for the rest of the war . beevor , op . cit . , p . 231 . the cretan resistance . from the first days of the invasion , the local population organized a resistance movement , participating widely in guerrilla groups and intelligence networks . the first resistance groups formed in the cretan mountains as early as june 1941 . in september 1943 , a memorable battle between the troops of occupation resistance fighters led by '' kapetan '' bandouvas in the region of syme resulted in the deaths of eighty-three german soldiers and another thirteen were taken as prisoners . there were reprisals for resistance , german officers routinely used firing squads against cretan civilians and razed villages to the ground . standing out amongst the atrocities , are the holocausts of viannos and kedros in amari , the destruction of anogeia and kandanos and the massacre of kondomari . beevor , antony . crete : the battle and the resistance , john murray ltd , 1991 . penguin books , 1992 . . liberation . by late 1944 german forces were withdrawing from greece to avoid being cut off by the advancing russian army moving west across europe . by the end of september , german and italian troops began withdrawing from crete , and on october 13 both rethymon and heraklion were liberated as the occupying forces were withdrawn to the chania area . on may 9 , 1945 the german commander signed an unconditional surrender at the villa ariadne at knossos , effective “ 10 o'clock greenwich mean time on the tenth day of may 1945 ” . other notable historical events . cretan school of art . an important school of icon painting , under the umbrella of post-byzantine art with latin influences , which flourished while crete was under venetian rule during the late middle ages , reaching its climax after the fall of constantinople , becoming the central force in greek painting during the 15th , 16th and 17th centuries . cretan literature . due to the economic and intellectual growth observed in crete during the venetian era , cretan literature was rich in quantity and quality and important for the subsequent course of modern greek literature . the peaceful living and contact with a developed intellectual and cultural people were the factors that contributed to the cultivation of education and literature and the emergence of remarkable literary production . the black death . as a result of plagues of the black death , many cretans migrated overseas during difficult periods on the island , some acquiring great fortune abroad , such as constantine corniaktos ( c . 1517–1603 ) who became one of the richest people in eastern europe . . see also . cretan revolt history of greece list of rulers of crete . further reading . hopkins , adam crete : its past , present and people
