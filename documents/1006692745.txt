Supply chain

overview . a typical supply chain begins with the ecological , biological , and political regulation of natural resources , followed by the human extraction of raw material , and includes several production links ( e.g . , component construction , assembly , and merging ) before moving on to several layers of storage facilities of ever-decreasing size and increasingly remote geographical locations , and finally reaching the consumer . many of the exchanges encountered in the supply chain are therefore between different companies that seek to maximize their revenue within their sphere of interest but may have little or no knowledge or interest in the remaining players in the supply chain . more recently , the loosely coupled , self-organizing network of businesses who cooperate to provide product and service offerings has been called the extended enterprise , and the use of the term '' chain '' and the linear structure it appears to represent have been criticised as '' harder to relate . to the way supply networks really operate . keith , r . , so why do we call it a 'supply chain ' anyway ? , industry week , emphasis added , published 3 december 2012 , accessed 6 january 2021 a chain is actually a complex and dynamic supply and demand network . as part of their efforts to demonstrate ethical practices , many large companies and global brands are integrating codes of conduct and guidelines into their corporate cultures and management systems . through these , corporations are making demands on their suppliers ( facilities , farms , subcontracted services such as cleaning , canteen , security etc . ) and verifying , through social audits , that they are complying with the requirement . a lack of transparency in the supply chain is known as mystification , which bars consumers from the knowledge of where their purchases originated and can enable socially irresponsible practices . supply-chain managers are under constant scrutiny to secure the best pricing for their resources , which becomes a difficult task when faced with the inherent lack of transparency . cost benchmarking is one effective method for identifying competitive pricing within the industry . this gives negotiation a solid basis to form their strategy on and drive overall spend down . modeling . there are a variety of supply-chain models , which address both the upstream and downstream elements of supply-chain management ( scm ) . the scor ( supply-chain operations reference ) model , developed by a consortium of industry and the non-profit supply chain council ( now part of apics ) became the cross-industry de facto standard defining the scope of supply-chain management . scor measures total supply-chain performance . it is a process reference model for supply-chain management , spanning from the supplier 's supplier to the customer 's customer . it includes delivery and order fulfillment performance , production flexibility , warranty and returns processing costs , inventory and asset turns , and other factors in evaluating the overall effective performance of a supply chain . the global supply chain forum has introduced another supply chain model . this framework is built on eight key business processes that are both cross-functional and cross-firm in nature . each process is managed by a cross-functional team including representatives from logistics , production , purchasing , finance , marketing , and research and development . while each process interfaces with key customers and suppliers , the processes of customer relationship management and supplier relationship management form the critical linkages in the supply chain . the risk-averse optimal position of the delivery window ( ra-opdw ) is another supply chain model . it was the first model to report that '' the optimal position of the supply chain delivery window , which is necessary to achieve supply chain resilience , is neither determined by penalty cost per time unit late nor by the penalty cost per time unit early but by their ratio . '' the american productivity and quality center ( apqc ) process classification framework ( pcf ) sm is a high-level , industry-neutral enterprise process model that allows organizations to see their business processes from a cross-industry viewpoint . the pcf was developed by apqc and its member organizations as an open standard to facilitate improvement through process management and benchmarking , regardless of industry , size , or geography . the pcf organizes operating and management processes into 12 enterprise-level categories , including process groups , and over 1,000 processes and associated activities . in the developing country public health setting , john snow , inc . has developed the jsi framework for integrated supply chain management in public health , which draws from commercial sector best practices to solve problems in public health supply chains . . management . in the 1980s , the term supply-chain management ( scm ) was developed to express the need to integrate the key business processes , from end user through original suppliers . original suppliers are those that provide products , services , and information that add value for customers and other stakeholders . the basic idea behind scm is that companies and corporations involve themselves in a supply chain by exchanging information about market fluctuations and production capabilities . keith oliver , a consultant at booz allen hamilton , is credited with the term 's invention after using it in an interview for the financial times in 1982 . andrew feller , dan shunk , & tom callarman ( 2006 ) . bptrends , march 2006 - value chains vs . supply chains the term was used earlier by alizamir et al . in 1981 . alizamir , s . , alptekinoglu , a . , & sapra , a .

'' supply chain strategy development '' retrieved 2014-3-25 . supply chain resilience is improved by inter-firm and inter-personal collaboration across the network , supporting faster adaptation to supply changes . it is not about responding to a one-time crisis , or just having a flexible supply chain . it is about continuously anticipating and adjusting to discontinuities that can permanently impair the value proposition of a core business with special focus on delivering customer satisfaction . strategic resilience requires continuous innovation with respect to product structures , processes , but also corporate behaviour . . role of the internet . on the internet , customers can directly contact the distributors . this has reduced the length of the chain to some extent by cutting down on middlemen . some of the benefits are cost reduction and greater collaboration . . social responsibility . incidents like the 2013 savar building collapse with more than 1,100 victims have led to widespread discussions about corporate social responsibility across global supply chains . wieland and handfield ( 2013 ) suggest that companies need to audit products and suppliers and that supplier auditing needs to go beyond direct relationships with first-tier suppliers ( those who supply the main customer directly ) . they also demonstrate that visibility needs to be improved if the supply can not be directly controlled and that smart and electronic technologies play a key role to improve visibility . finally , they highlight that collaboration with local partners , across the industry and with universities is crucial to successfully manage social responsibility in supply chains . . traceability in agricultural supply chains . many agribusinesses and food processors source raw materials from smallholder farmers . this is particularly true in certain sectors , such as coffee , cocoa and sugar . over the past 20 years , there has been a shift towards more traceable supply chains . rather than purchasing crops that have passed through several layers of collectors , firms are now sourcing directly from farmers or trusted aggregators . the drivers for this change include concerns about food safety , child labor and environmental sustainability as well as a desire to increase productivity and improve crop quality . international finance corporation ( 2013 ) , working with smallholders : a handbook for firms building sustainable supply chains ( online ) . . regulation . supply chain security has become particularly important in recent years . as a result , supply chains are often subject to global and local regulations . in the united states , several major regulations emerged in 2010 that have had a lasting impact on how global supply chains operate . these new regulations include the 10 + 2 ( isf ) and additional provisions of the certified cargo screening program . . development and design . with increasing globalization and easier access to alternative products in today 's markets , the importance of product design to generating demand is more significant than ever . in addition , as supply , and therefore competition , among companies for the limited market demand increases and as pricing and other marketing elements become less distinguishing factors , product design likewise plays a different role by providing attractive features to generate demand . in this context , demand generation is used to define how attractive a product design is in terms of creating demand . in other words , it is the ability of a product 's design to generate demand by satisfying customer expectations . but product design affects not only demand generation but also manufacturing processes , cost , quality , and lead time . the product design affects the associated supply chain and its requirements directly , including manufacturing , transportation , quality , quantity , production schedule , material selection , production technologies , production policies , regulations , and laws . broadly , the success of the supply chain depends on the product design and the capabilities of the supply chain , but the reverse is also true : the success of the product depends on the supply chain that produces it . since the product design dictates multiple requirements on the supply chain , as mentioned previously , then once a product design is completed , it drives the structure of the supply chain , limiting the flexibility of engineers to generate and evaluate different ( and potentially more cost-effective ) supply-chain alternatives . . see also . supply chain sustainability freight forwarder logistics supply chain attack . references . external links . supply chain and logistics terms and glossary logistics glossary by inbound logistics fr : gestion de la chaine logistique ja : サプライチェーン
