Minox

history . from 1936 to 1975 the history of the minox brand is essentially that of the minox subminiature camera . from 1975 the minox name also became associated with other products , most notably the minox 35 & nbsp ; mm compact cameras produced from 1975 until 2004 . minox was acquired by leica in 1996 , but a management buyout on 25 august 2001 left minox an independent company again . minox subminiature camera . subminiature camera history . right the original minox subminiature camera was invented by walter zapp in 1936 . zapp , a baltic german , was born in 1905 in riga , then part of the russian empire . the family moved to reval ( now called tallinn , estonia ) where he first took a job as an engraver before finding a position with a photographer . he became friends with nikolai 'nixi ' nylander and richard jürgens , and it was through discussions with these friends that the idea of a camera that could always be carried came to him . nixi nylander also coined the name '' minox '' and drew up the minox mouse logo . jürgens funded the original project but was not able to get support in estonia for production . jürgens contacted an english representative of the vef ( valsts elektrotehniskā fabrika ) electrotechnical manufacturing business in riga ( by then independent latvia ) who then arranged a meeting where zapp demonstrated the minox prototype ( urminox ) , with a set of enlargements made from ur-minox negatives . production began in riga at vef , running from 1937 until 1943 . morris moses & john wade : spycamera , the minox story , 2nd ed , . in the same time , vef had received patent protection on zapp 's inventions in at least 18 countries worldwide . shortly after its introduction , the minox was widely advertised in the european and american markets . it did not surmount the popularity of 35 & nbsp ; mm cameras ( which were then referred to as '' miniature cameras '' ) , but did achieve a niche market . it also attracted the attention of intelligence agencies in america , britain and germany , due to its small size and macro focusing ability . ironically during world war ii production of the minox was put in jeopardy several times as latvia fell victim to invasion by the soviet union , then germany , and then by the soviets again . cameras were produced under both russian and german occupation nevertheless , and the camera became both a luxury gift item for nazi leaders as well as a tool for their spies . in the meantime , zapp and his associates protected their interest in the product by searching for alternative production facilities in germany . right right after world war ii , production of the minox ii began in 1948 at a new company , minox gmbh , in giessen/heuchelheim near wetzlar , west germany . the new camera very much resembled the original , but was made with a plastic chassis covered by an aluminum shell . this greatly reduced its weight and , to an extent , cost . the camera continued to appeal to a luxury '' gadget '' market which broadened during the 1950s and early 1960s . it also continued to see use as an espionage camera by both sides during the cold war . during this time , the minox company continued to develop the camera , working with gossen to develop a companion miniature exposure meter , as well as improved models such as the minox b , which incorporated an even smaller gossen-designed meter into the camera itself . the minox b became the most popular and widely produced model of the line . further developments included autoexposure , and the company developed an extensive line of accessories . these included flash guns , viewfinder attachments , tripod mounts , and copying stands , all increasing the camera utility in a variety of applications . one accessory even allowed the camera to use a pair of binoculars as a telephoto lens ( see illustration ) . limited editions of the camera were also produced in a variety of luxury finishes , such as gold plating . standard cameras were also available in an optional black anodized finish . the riga minox camera , along with the luxury finish postwar cameras , are now collector 's items . newer electronic versions , such as the minox tlx , remain in production , essentially unchanged in features from the lx model since the late 1970s . with the introduction of the lx came significant redesign of the camera 's basic controls . there is also the fully electronic entry-level model , the ec , which has a very different internal design and has a fixed-focus lens . the production rate for these cameras is considerably slower than in former years , however , as minox devotes more time to the design and marketing of oem cameras under the minox brand . the minox tlx camera was available until september 2014 . interest in minox subminiature cameras is likely to increase as minox began manufacturing 8x11mm film in january 2015 . . spy camera . the minox subminiature camera attracted the attention of intelligence agencies in america , britain and germany , and most of the eastern bloc ( east germany , romania ) due to its small size and macro focusing ability . there is at least one document in the public record of 25 minox cameras purchased by the us office of strategic services intelligence organisation in 1942 . moses & wade , ibid . , p.69 . the close-focusing lens and small size of the camera made it perfect for covert uses such as surveillance or document copying . the minox was used by both axis and allied intelligence agents during world war ii . later versions were used well into the 1980s . the soviet spy john a . walker jr . , whose actions against the us navy cryptography programs represent some of the most compromising intelligence actions against the united states during the cold war era , used a minox c to photograph documents and ciphers . an measuring chain was provided with most minox subminiature cameras , which enabled easy copying of letter-sized documents . the espionage use of the minox has been portrayed in hollywood movies and tv shows , and some 1980s minox advertising has played up the '' spy camera '' story . other special uses . a minox b , operated by remote trigger and protected in a special housing , was used to inspect the interior of the united states army 's sl-1 experimental nuclear reactor after it experienced an internal steam explosion in 1961 . this camera and housing were shown in the film report released following the accident investigation . technical details of minox 8×11 cameras . right the original riga-made minox had a brass chassis covered in a stainless steel shell , which telescopes to reveal or cover the lens and viewfinder windows , as well as to advance the film . it was equipped with a parallax correcting viewfinder , which was coupled to a cooke triplet type minostigmat 15 & nbsp ; mm f/3.5 lens . the lens was capable of focusing as close as 20 & nbsp ; cm , and , due to its small image size , provided such depth of field at full aperture that a diaphragm was deemed unnecessary . the maximum focus zone was about one meter to infinity . in front of the lens was a metal foil curtain shutter , which was itself protected by a window . these were advanced features at the time for any camera , regardless of size . the dimensions of the minox subminiature camera are : 80 & nbsp ; mm × 27 & nbsp ; mm x 16 & nbsp ; mm ; weight : 130 & nbsp ; g . the minox cameras project an image of 8×11 & nbsp ; mm onto the negative . the film is in strips 9.2 & nbsp ; mm wide , or less than one-quarter the size of 35 mm film , and unlike 35 & nbsp ; mm film , it has no sprocket holes . this film strip is rolled up in the supply side chamber of a small twin chamber cartridge , with the film leader taped to a take-up spool in the take up chamber . the film strips can be up to 50 frames in length for riga minox and minox ii , iii , iiis and b cameras . from minox bl and c cameras onward the minox film cartridge holds 15 , 30 , or 36 exposures . the vef riga has a three-element flat film plane lens . performance could be improved , so the short-lived minox ii ( 1948–1951 ) had a new 5 element lens ( called complan ) whose final element would rest against the film itself when the pressure plate pushed the film onto the lens . customers complained of film scratches with this new design , so most of these lenses were replaced by minox with the later curved-field compensating lens . consequently , original 'film lens ' minox ii are exceptional . early minox cameras from minox a/iii to minox b were equipped with a four-element , three-group complan ( lens ) designed by ex-leica lens designer arthur seibert . the complan lens has a curved film plane , hence in these cameras the negative must be held in an arc to improve the edge-to-edge sharpness of the image . the minox enlarger also holds the negative in this same curve . later models , beginning with late model minox b , to the current model tlx , using the 15 & nbsp ; mm f/3.5 four-element , three-group flat-field minox lens , holds the negative flat . the advance was attributed by rolf kasemeier ( small minox big pictures 1971 edition ) to new rare-earth element , high-index , low-dispersion , optical glasses becoming available ( probably from schott glass , of jena ) . note that lens performance between old and new complan/minox lenses was rated by minox themselves as identical . at this time to differentiate between negatives taken with the older complan lens and negatives taken with the later minox lens , minox introduced an edge code in the negative . since the minox c ( the first camera released with the new minox lens ) every 8x11mm camera had a distinct edge code to identify the camera . the reason was that commercial processors used minox enlargers . as the minox lens replaced the complan , so the enlargers had to change lenses : minox ii enlargers were curved negative track and complan lenses , minox iii enlargers were straight negative track and minox lenses . ironically , owners of rigas and model ii cameras would get better results from a minox iii enlarger than a minox ii enlarger . the early minox cameras from riga to minox b , bl and ax , were equipped with a mechanical shutter , while later model minox ( c , lx , ec , tlx ) cameras have an electromagnetic shutter . when closed , the viewfinder and lens windows are protected . complan lens and minox lens are unit focusing lens , focusing from 8 inches ( 20 & nbsp ; cm ) to infinity through precision gear linked to a focusing dial on top of the camera . all minox cameras , except the ec and mx , have a parallax correction viewfinder : when the focusing dial moves , the viewfinder moves in tandem to correct for parallax . from the riga to minox b , the film counter counts up to 50 , while from minox bl , c , to tlx , the film counter counts down from 36/30/15 . for mechanical minox 8x11 cameras , a separate shutter speed dial sets the shutter speed from 1/2 to 1/1000 second , plus b and t ( bl has no documented t ) . for electromagnetic shutter cameras , the shutter dial starts with 1/15 sec , and ends with 1/1000 ( minox c ) , or starts with 1/30 and ends with 1/2000 ( minox lx/tlx/clx ) ; the electromagnetic minox camera also has an ' a ' setting for automatic exposure , controlled by the built-in cds ( minox c ) or spd ( minox lx/tlx ) exposure meter . above the viewfinder is a filter bar used to slide a yellow , green or an orange filter in front of the lens ; starting with the bl , there is only a neutral density filter . for riga minox to minox b , the film advances each time the camera is closed , regardless of whether a picture is taken or not . opening the camera causes the pressure plate to press the film into a concave or flat ( depending on the model ) surface to stiffen thin emulsions for better clarity . when the camera is closed , the pressure plate moves back from the film plane , thus allowing the film strip to move freely to advance to the next frame . from minox bl onward , the camera is equipped with a '' freewheeling '' mechanism , such that the film advances one frame only when a picture is taken , otherwise , closing the camera does not advance a frame . minox bl uses a px625 button cell to power the cds exposure meter ; minox c , lx , ec , used a 5.6v px27 mercury battery to power the exposure meter and electromagnetic shutter . tlx , clx , ecx use four 1.5v 386 silver oxide button cell in an adapter ; this adapter combo can also be used to replace the discontinued 5.6v px27 battery for minox c , lx and ec . 8×11mm tlx special order models were available new until september 2014 . image:2016 minox c 8.jpg minox c image : minoxbl.jpg minox bl image : minoxcopystand.jpg minox bl attached to a minox copystand image : tele minox.jpg minox bl attached to an 8×35 binocular image : lx platin.jpg } minox lx platin image : germanminoxclubec.jpg 1st german minox club ec in riga blue color file : minox mx set.jpg minox mx set image : minox clx.jpg minox clx image : minox tlx w microscope.jpg minox tlx attached to a 400× microscope file : sharan rolleiflex 1.jpg minox/sharan rolleiflex 2.8f classic film camera file : minox film cassette.jpg the minox film cassette . major production runs . right minox models riga – 1938/39 to 1942/43 ( retrospectively labeled model i ;

mm × 61 & nbsp ; mm × 31 & nbsp ; mm ) , glass fibre reinforced makrolon bodied 35 mm film camera designed by professor fischer of vienna university : the minox el , the first one in minox 35 & nbsp ; mm series . these compact cameras featured a drawbridge style lens cover which when lowered brought forward a 35 & nbsp ; mm focal length f/2.8 four-element , three-group tessar-type minotar/minoxar lens with between the lens leaf shutter and diaphragm , a center positioned viewfinder , two stroke film winder lever and a film rewind knob . the minox 35 camera back must be removed for loading or unloading film . the camera offered aperture priority exposure with the option of manual settings . the minox 35ml and minox m.d.c offer program mode ( p mode ) exposure in addition to aperture priority . the 35 & nbsp ; mm/2.8 minotar/minoxar lens was very sharp , with low distortion , while the camera 's metering-system 's capability to produce excellent results especially under low-light conditions was outstanding – using exposure times of up to two minutes . some models have a 2x backlit exposure switch and a 10 sec timer switch . when the timer is engaged , a flashing led indicates the timer counter is counting down , for the last two sec , the flash interval shortened . until 1995 the minox 35 cameras were considered the smallest cameras for the standard 35 & nbsp ; mm film format . the design was inspired by the rollei 35 , which had been the smallest 35 & nbsp ; mm camera for eight years . the rollei 35 is only slightly bigger , but much heavier than the minox 35 cameras . however , the minolta tc-1 , introduced in 1996 , is smaller . minox 35 mm compact camera versions . minox el , 1974 minox gl , 1979–1981 minox gt , 1981–1991 minox gt-golf , 1984 minox gt-sport all the above models use a single 5.6 v px27 battery which can be replaced with two cr 1/3n 3 v lithium batteries by using an adapter . minox pl , 1982–1983 , program-controlled version of el- or g-series minox ml , 1985–1995 minox mb , 1986–1999 minox al , 1987–1988 , simplified program-controlled version of el- or g-series minox af , 1988–1990 , autofocus minox gt-e , 1988–1993 with built in uv filter . minox af-90 , 1990– , autofocus minox mb touring , 1990 minox goldknopf 1991–1993 , el- or g-series version with a solid gold button for shutter release . minox gse , 1991–1994 minox m.d.c , 1992–1995 . this is the flagship of minox 35 & nbsp ;
