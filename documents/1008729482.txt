'' . sentries did detect boats moving along the river that morning , but they were expecting a french supply convoy to pass that night—a plan that had been changed without vergor being notified . . when the boats , loaded with the first wave of british troops , were challenged , a french-speaking officer , either a captain fraser or captain donald mcdonald of the 78th fraser highlanders , was able to answer the challenge in excellent french , allaying suspicion . ; . the boats , however , had drifted slightly off course : instead of landing at the base of the road , many soldiers found themselves at the base of a slope . a group of 24 volunteers led by colonel william howe with fixed bayonets were sent to clear the picket along the road , and climbed the slope , a maneuver that allowed them to come up behind vergor 's camp and capture it quickly . wolfe followed an hour later when he could use an easy access road to climb to the plain . thus , by the time the sun rose over the plains of abraham , wolfe 's army had a solid foothold at the top of the cliffs of the promontory of quebec . . . battle . left the plateau was undefended save for vergor 's camp , as vaudreuil had ordered one of the french regiments to relocate to the east of the city not long before the landing . had the immediate defenders been more numerous , the british might have been unable to deploy or even been pushed back . an officer who would normally have patrolled the cliffs regularly through the night was unable to on the night of the 12th because one of his horses had been stolen and his two others were lame . . the first notice of the landing came from a runner who had fled from vergor 's camp , but one of montcalm 's aides felt the man was mad and sent him away , then went back to bed . . saunders had staged a diversionary action off montmorency , firing on the shore emplacements through the night and loading boats with troops , many of them taken from field hospitals ; this preoccupied montcalm . . montcalm was taken aback to learn of the british deployment , and his response has been regarded as precipitate . . though he might have awaited reinforcement by bougainville 's column ( allowing simultaneous frontal and rear attacks on the british position ) or avoided battle while he concentrated his forces , or even yielded the city to wolfe , he instead elected to confront wolfe 's force directly . had he waited , the british would have been entirely cut off—they had nowhere to go but back down the foulon , and would have been under fire the entire way . . to an artillery officer named montbelliard , montcalm explained his decision thus : '' we can not avoid action ; the enemy is entrenching , he already has two pieces of cannon . if we give him time to establish himself , we shall never be able to attack him with the troops we have . '' . . first engagements . in total , montcalm had 13,390 regular troops , troupes de la marine , and militia available in quebec city and along the beauport shore , as well as 200 cavalry , 200 artillery ( including the guns of quebec ) , 300 first nations ( including many odawa under charles de langlade . ) , and 140 acadian volunteers , but most of these troops did not participate in the action . many of the militia were inexperienced ; the acadian , canadian , and indigenous irregulars were more used to guerilla warfare . by contrast , the british 7,700 troops were almost all regulars . on the morning of 13 september , wolfe 's army formed a line first with their backs to the river , then spread out across the plains with its right anchored by the bluff along the st . lawrence and its left by a bluff and thick wood above the st . charles river . while the regular french forces were approaching from beauport and quebec , the canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the british left flank , sheltering in the trees and scrub ; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat , eventually holding the bridge over the st . charles river . . of the british troops , approximately 3,300 formed into a shallow horseshoe formation that stretched across the width of the plains , the main firing line being roughly one kilometre long . two battalions were deployed , facing north , to cover the left flank and a further two formed a reserve . in order to cover the entire plain , wolfe was forced to array his soldiers two ranks deep , rather than the more conventional three ranks . on the left wing , regiments under townshend exchanged fire with the militia in the scrub and captured a small collection of houses and gristmill to anchor the line . the defenders pushed the british from one house , but were repelled and , in retreat , lit several houses on fire to keep them out of enemy hands . smoke from these fires wound up masking the british left , and may have confused montcalm as to the width of the lines . . as wolfe 's men waited for the defenders , the steady fire became intense enough that wolfe ordered his men to lie down amid the high grass and brush . . image : montcalm leading his troops at the plains of abraham.jpg thumb montcalm leading his troops into battle . watercolour by charles william jefferys ( 1869–1951 ) as french troops arrived from beauport , montcalm , one of few mounted men on the field , decided that a swift assault was the only way to dislodge the british from their position . accordingly , he deployed the forces immediately available in and near quebec city and prepared an immediate attack , without waiting for further reinforcements from the beauport shore . he arrayed his approximately 3,500 soldiers into place , his best regulars three deep , others six deep and his poorest regiment in column . at approximately 10 & nbsp ; a.m . , montcalm , riding his dark horse and waving his sword to encourage his men , . ordered a general advance on the british line . as a european-trained military leader , montcalm 's instinct was for large , set-piece battles in which regiments and soldiers moved in precise order . such actions required a disciplined soldiery , painstakingly drilled for as long as 18 months on the parade ground , trained to march in time , change formation at a word , and retain cohesion in the face of bayonet charges and musket volleys . though his regular regiments ( the '' troupes de terre '' or '' metropolitans '' ) were adept at such formal warfare , in the course of the campaign their ranks had been replenished by less professional militiamen , whose talents at forest warfare emphasised the individual : they tended to fire early and then drop to the ground to reload , thus reducing the effect of concentrated fire at close range . . . main engagement . as the french approached , the british lines held their fire . wolfe had devised a firing method for stopping french column advances in 1755 that called for the centre—in this case , the 43rd and 47th foot regiments—to hold fire while waiting for the advancing force to approach within , then open fire at close range . the french held their fire and both armies waited for two or three minutes . the french finally fired two disorganized volleys . ian macpherson mcculloch , '' son of the mountains '' , pp . 186–187 . wolfe had ordered his soldiers to charge their muskets with two balls each in preparation for the engagement . . captain john knox , serving with the 43rd foot , wrote in his journal that as the french came within range , the regiments '' gave them , with great calmness , as remarkable a close and heavy discharge as i ever saw '' . after the first volley , the british lines marched forward a few paces towards the shocked french force and fired a second general volley that shattered the attackers and sent them into retreat . . thumb wolfe , positioned with the 28th foot and the louisbourg grenadiers , had moved to a rise to observe the battle ; he had been struck in the wrist early in the fight , but had wrapped the injury and continued on . volunteer james henderson , with the louisbourg grenadiers , had been tasked with holding the hill , and reported afterwards that within moments of the command to fire , wolfe was struck with two shots , one low in the stomach and the second , a mortal wound in the chest . . . knox wrote that one of the soldiers near wolfe shouted '' they run , see how they run . '' wolfe , on the ground , opened his eyes and asked who was running . upon being told that the french had broken , he gave several orders , then turned on his side and said '' now , god be praised , i will die in peace '' , and died . . with wolfe dead and several other key officers injured , british troops fell into a disorganised pursuit of the retreating french troops . the 78th fraser highlanders were ordered by brigadier-general james murray to pursue the french with their swords , but were met near the city by a heavy fire from a floating battery covering the bridge over the st . charles river as well as militia that remained in the trees . the 78th took the highest number of casualties of all british units in the battle . . thumb an eyewitness with the 78th highlanders ( dr . robert macpherson ) wrote three days after the battle : the highlanders pursued them to the very sally port of the town . the highlanders returned towards the main body . when the highlanders were gathered together , they lay 'd on a separate attack against a large body of canadians on our flank that were posted in a small village and a bush of woods . here , after a wonderful escape all day , we suffered great loss both in officers and men but at last drove them under the cover of their cannon which likeways did us considerable loss . ian macpherson mcculloch , '' son of the mountains '' , pp . 186 townshend took charge of the british forces and realised that bougainville 's column was approaching from the british rear , having taken some time to arrive from cap rouge . he quickly formed up two battalions from the confused troops on the field and turned them to meet the oncoming french , a day-saving manoeuvre ; instead of attacking with a well rested and ready force , bougainville retreated while the rest of montcalm 's army slipped back across the st . charles . . during the retreat , montcalm , still mounted , was struck by either canister shot from the british artillery or repeated musket fire , suffering injuries to the lower abdomen and thigh . he was able to make it back into the city , but his wounds were mortal and he died at the wee hours the next morning . . a few moments before he drew his last breath , montcalm asked his surgeon how much time he had to live . '' a few hours , '' he was answered . '' all the better , '' he said , '' i will not see the british in quebec . '' he was buried in a shell crater left in the floor of the ursuline chapel by a british shell . . in 2001 , his remains were moved to the military cemetery at the hôpital-général , near the st . charles river , where they were placed in a mausoleum . press release , commission de la capitale nationale du québec , retrieved 26 april 2007 in terms of casualties the british suffered 658 killed or wounded , of these , sixty one officers and men were killed and 597 were wounded . the french , on the other hand , had suffered around 644 to 716 killed or wounded , among those thirteen officers , and a further 350 men were taken prisoner . . aftermath . in the wake of the battle , a state of confusion spread through the french troops . governor de vaudreuil , who later wrote to his government and put the full blame for the french rout on the deceased montcalm , . decided to abandon quebec and the beauport shore , ordering all of his forces to march west and eventually join up with bougainville , leaving the garrison in quebec under the command of jean-baptiste nicolas roch de ramezay . . meanwhile , the british , first under the command of townshend and later with murray in charge , settled in to besiege the city in conjunction with saunders ' fleet . within days , on 18 september , de ramezay , townshend and saunders signed the articles of capitulation of quebec and the city was turned over to british control . . the remaining french forces positioned themselves on the jacques-cartier river west of the city . the british navy was forced to leave the st . lawrence shortly after the capture of quebec , lest pack ice close the mouth of the river . the next april , before the ice left the rivers , the chevalier de lévis , montcalm 's successor as french commander , marched his 7,000 troops to quebec . james murray , the british commander , had experienced a terrible winter , in which scurvy had reduced his garrison to only 4,000 . on 28 april , lévis ' forces met and defeated the british at the battle of sainte-foy , immediately west of the city ( near the site of université laval today ) . this battle proved bloodier than that of the plains of abraham , with about 850 casualties on the french side and 1,100 on the british side . the french had defeated the british , but the british were able to withdraw within the walls of quebec , to which the french laid siege . a lack of artillery and ammunition , combined with british improvements to the fortifications , meant that the french were unable to take the city by storm . both sides awaited reinforcements from europe . the first ships to arrive , in mid-may , were part of a british fleet which had battle of neuville . . the success of the french army 's offensive against quebec in the spring of 1760 had depended on the dispatch of a french armada , with fresh troops and supplies . a naval battle fought at quiberon bay , just off the coast of france , proved the decisive battle for this part of new france . the royal navy destroyed the french fleet , meaning france could not send a reserve force to save new france . . at montréal that september , lévis and 2,000 troops were confronted with 17,000 british and american troops . the french capitulated on 8 september , and the british took possession of montreal . the treaty of paris was signed in 1763 to end the war and gave possession of parts of new france to great britain , including canada and the eastern half of french louisiana—lying between the mississippi river and the appalachian mountains . legacy . image : battlefields park tables and martello tower.jpg thumb martello tower ( constructed by the british 1808–1812 ) in the battlefields park , quebec city in 2009 , a number of activities were proposed to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the battle of the plains of abraham . official reenactors ' website for the event . this website is not the official website of the event . a plan to hold a reenactment of the battle itself ( as well as a reenactment of the subsequent french victory of 1760 at the battle of sainte-foy ) was cancelled due to threats of public disorder . leaders of separatist parties described the event as a slap in the face for quebecers of french ancestry and as an insult for the francophone majority . some sovereigntist groups threatened or made indirect threats by stating that if the event took place , there could be violence . the movement against re-enactment and these threats of violence led the national battlefields commission to cancel the event . cbc news : organizers cancel mock battle of the plains of abraham another commemorative event was proposed for the anniversary , the moulin à paroles . thousands gathered on the plains of abraham to listen to recitations of 140 significant texts from quebec history , including the 1970 flq manifesto . the inclusion of that document in the event led to condemnations and a boycott from federalist politicians and the withdrawal of some government funding for the event . the moulin à paroles took place without incident . cbc news : plains of abraham reading attracts thousands during building
