USS George H.W. Bush

naming . george h . w . bush became one of the u.s . navy 's youngest pilot when he received his naval aviator wings and naval commission on 9 june 1943 , three days before turning 19 . he flew torpedo bombers off on active duty from august 1943 to september 1945 during world war ii . on 2 & nbsp ; september 1944 , during a mission over the pacific , japanese anti-aircraft fire hit his plane . the navy submarine rescued him . he was awarded the distinguished flying cross and three air medals for courageous service in the pacific war . uss george h.w . bush is the second united states aircraft carrier to be named after a naval aviator was the first ) and the second , following , to be named after a then living former president ( ronald reagan was christened in 2001 while reagan was still alive ) . ship 's seal . each element of the seal is significant for its relevance to the ship 's namesake , naval aviation , naval service , and the nation . there are six prominent features of the seal , beginning with the 41 white stars , symbolizing the ship 's namesake ( the 41st president ) . the rays of light that appear on the seal 's horizon represent bush 's concept of a '' thousand points of light '' , wherein he urged americans to find meaning and reward by serving a purpose higher than themselves . the graphic depiction of the aircraft carrier reflects the carrier , as both a symbol and instrument of american strength as a force for freedom . above the carrier are the overhead profiles of a tbm avenger torpedo bomber ( representing bush 's days as a navy pilot ) , an f/a-18 hornet strike fighter , and an f-35c lightning ii , superimposed one upon the other in reverse chronological order of the individual aircraft 's service entry date , and in diminishing scale so each outline is contained within that of the newer aircraft . fouled anchors and shields , centered on naval aviators wings , honor the ship 's namesake 's aviation history . finally , the motto '' freedom at work '' is adapted from bush 's inaugural speech , during which he said , '' we know what works : freedom works . we know what â€™ s right : freedom is right . '' . description . george h.w . bush measures and displaces over 100,000 tons , making her one of the world 's largest warships ( though she is slightly shorter than . her top speed exceeds 30 & nbsp ; knots ; powered with two nuclear reactors , she can operate for more than 20 & nbsp ; years without refueling . several features differentiate cvn-77 from other ships in the nimitz class . . hull . new features include a bulbous bow design that provides more buoyancy to the forward end of the ship and improves hull efficiency , curved flight deck edges to reduce radar signature , a new underwater hull coating system , deck modernized coverings to reduce ship weight by 100 & nbsp ; tons , low solar absorptive and anti-stain paint , a less cluttered hangar bay , and a new propeller design . . island . george h.w . bush is the second carrier to have a modernized island , which includes a new radar tower ( enclosed to reduce radar signature ) , navigation system upgrades , communication systems enhancements , and armored windows . the island is smaller and has been repositioned further aft to improve flight deck access and reduce signature and electronic self-interference . . air operations . new air operations design features include an updated aviation fuel storage and distribution system , semi-automated refueling and servicing with new deck locations to provide faster , more efficient aircraft pit stops , requiring fewer people , modernized aircraft launch , and recovery equipment , and redesigned jet blast deflectors . . environmental . environmental upgrades have also been designed into the ship , including a vacuum collection/marine sanitation device ( vc/msd ) , a new marine sewage system that uses sea water in lieu of fresh water for lower maintenance costs . many older ships in the u.s . & nbsp ; navy utilize a gravity-driven collection holding and transfer ( cht ) system to handle sewage waste . newer u.s . & nbsp ; navy ships , including now cvn-77 , collect sewage waste by vacuum , allowing for greater flexibility in piping installation , smaller pipe sizes overall and reducing water consumption . the collection tanks of george h.w . bush were modified to accommodate both the vcht ( vacuum cht ) equipment and the elements of a marine sanitization device to treat the waste prior to discharge . george h.w . bush is the only aircraft carrier in the u.s . navy to combine the two technologies . this new vc/msd driven waste management system has , however , not been without problems . reports began surfacing immediately after delivery in may 2009 of issues with the ship 's toilet system . as of november 2011 , the entire system has gone down at least twice , rendering all 423 commodes in the ship 's 130 heads inoperable , with many more incidents that have rendered either half of the ship , or sections of the ship , without operating sanitary facilities . in one ship-wide incident , a repair crew spent 35 non-stop hours attempting to return the system to working order . the system is said to suffer breakdowns when inappropriate materials such as feminine hygiene products are flushed down the toilets . during a four-month maintenance period in the dock in 2012 , anti-clog measures were installed in the ship 's toilet disposal systems . shapiro , michael welles , '' naval shipyard tackles toilet clogs on the bush while ship is in for repairs '' , newport news daily press , 29 september 2012 . electronics and communications . new electronics and communications technology , space rearrangement , operational procedure changes , advanced sensor technologies and maintenance systems have been incorporated to reduce manning costs . a new zonal electrical distribution system will keep problems from affecting other parts of the ship . automated material movement devices , semi-autonomous , gravity compensated weapons handling devices , damage control automation systems and components have also been installed . medical and dental equipment have been upgraded , integrated display screens in damage control central have been modernized to improve data integration and display , and equipment in general shops has been modernized to improve productivity . . history . the contract to build cvn-77 was awarded to northrop grumman shipbuilding newport news on 26 & nbsp ; january 2001 . a naming ceremony was held on 9 & nbsp ; december 2002 at northrop grumman newport news , with former president george h.w . bush attending . secretary of the navy gordon r . england , presided at the ceremony . construction . the keel laying ceremony was held on 6 september 2003 , with former president george h . w . bush serving as the keynote speaker . former first lady barbara bush also attended with their daughter , dorothy bush koch , the ship 's sponsor . the former president authenticated the keel by chalking his initials onto a metal plate . his initials were then welded onto the plate , which was permanently affixed to the ship . the ship was modularly constructed , where large sections are assembled and then lifted into place using a large crane . major milestones in the construction include the bow placement in march 2005 , followed by the island placement on 8 & nbsp ; july 2006 . the was lifted onto the flight deck in a ceremony called '' mast stepping '' which dates from antiquity and consists of placing coins or other items of significance under the step or bottom of a ship 's mast during construction . since at least the construction of in the 1790s , this tradition has been passed on as a symbol of good luck for u.s . navy ships . george h . w . bush participated in the event , placing his naval aviator wings underneath the island during the ceremony . george h.w . bush was christened on 7 & nbsp ;
