in the broadest sense it provided a statutory governance framework . the act established the 'tripartite ' model of policing , which formed police authority . this established a three-way balance of power between the authority 's chairman , the chief constable and the home secretary . this arrangement varied within london for the metropolitan police and the city of london police . the police act 1964 was superseded by the police act 1996 , which contained similar provisions . further legislation was introduced for the british transport police and the civil nuclear constabulary that was similar in defining their organisational form and embedding governance arrangements . constables outside police forces . legislation exists allowing constables to be appointed for specific roles , enjoying the full powers and privileges of a constable while carrying out their duty . environment agency water bailiffs , who check fishing permits and enforce some wildlife laws . her majesty 's prison service prison officers ( only those employed by the state , not private employees contracted to operate in prisons ) . national crime agency ( formerly soca ) investigators are designated with the powers of a constable ( as well as those of an immigration officer and customs officer ) . ports , tunnels , oxford and cambridge universities , epping forest , anglican cathedrals ( cathedral constables ) , and markets can also appoint constables to police on their land . these are often referred to as 'private police forces/constabularies ' . local authorities can appoint constables to enforce local by-laws , as seen in a number of london boroughs . channel islands . in jersey and guernsey , the elected heads of the parishes ( paroisse ( s ) in french ) are titled '' constables '' ( connétable ( s ) in french ) . the constables are entitled each to carry a silver-tipped baton of office . in jersey , each parish elects a constable for a three-year mandate to run the parish and also represent the parish in the legislature , the states of jersey . the constable presides over the roads committee , the conseil paroissial ( parish council , the only exception being st . helier ) and parish assemblies . the twelve constables also collectively sit as the comité des connétables ( committee of constables ) . the constable is the titular head of the honorary police . with the roads inspectors , roads committee and other officers , the constable of each parish also carries out the visite du branchage twice a year . in guernsey , each parish elects two constables , the senior constable and the junior constable . persons elected generally serve a year as junior and then senior constable . the senior constable presides over the douzaine ( dozen ) that runs the parish . the constables are responsible for enforcing the brancage ( summer hedge-cutting ) and also have the power to declare any parishioner insane . united states . in the united states , there is no consistent use of the office of constable throughout the states , and use may even vary within a state . a constable may be an official responsible for service of process : such as summonses and subpoenas for people to appear in court in criminal and/or civil matters . on the other hand , they can be fully empowered police officers . constables may also have additional specialized duties unique to the office . in some states , a constable may be appointed by the governor or a judge or magistrate of the court which he or she serves ; in others the constable is an elected or appointed position at the state or local level of local government . their jurisdiction can vary from statewide to county/parish and local township boundaries based on the state 's laws . the office developed from its british counterpart during the colonial period . prior to the modernization of law enforcement which took place in the middle 19th century , local law enforcement was performed by constables and watchmen . a brief guide to police history , north carolina wesleyan college constables were appointed or elected at the local level for specific terms and , like their uk counterparts the parish constable , were not paid and did not wear a uniform . however , they were often paid a fee by the courts for each writ served and warrant executed . following the example of the british metropolitan police established in 1829 , the states gradually enacted laws to permit municipalities to establish police departments . this differed from the uk in that the old system was not uniformly abolished in every state . often the enacting legislation of the state conferred a police officer with the powers of a constable , the most important of these powers being the common law power of arrest . police and constables exist concurrently in many jurisdictions . perhaps because of this , the title '' constable '' is not used for police of any rank . the lowest rank in a police organization would be officer , deputy , patrolman , trooper , and historically , private , depending on the particular organization . in many states , constables do not conduct patrols or preventive policing activities . in such states the office is relatively obscure to its citizens . a constable may be assisted by deputy constables as sworn officers or constable 's officers as civil staff , usually as process servers . in some states , villages or towns , an office with similar duties is marshal . historical usage . medieval armenia and georgia . the titles of sparapet and spaspet , derived from the ancient iranian spahbod , were used to designate the supreme commander of the armed forces in the medieval kingdoms of armenia and georgia , respectively . byzantine empire . the position of constable originated from the roman empire ;

but he can not judge , because there is no judgment at the tower , since there the third element of a judicial proceeding is lacking , namely a judge and jurisdiction . he has record as to matters of fact , not matters of judgment and law . in bracton 's time , anyone seeing a '' misdeed '' was empowered to make an arrest . the role of the constable in bracton 's description was as the '' eyes and ears '' of the court , finding evidence and recording facts on which judges could make a ruling . by extension , the constable was also the '' strong arm '' of the court ( i.e . , of the common law ) , marking the basic role of the constable that continues into the present day . in 1285 , king edward i of england passed the statute of winchester , with provisions which '' constituted two constables in every hundred to prevent defaults in towns and on highways '' . p276-7 , markham , sir frank , history of milton keynes and district , vol.1 ( 1973 ) , records of their narrower area successors , parish constables , appear in the early 17th century in the records of buckinghamshire ;
