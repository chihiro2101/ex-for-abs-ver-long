Pentium OverDrive

486 sockets . the pentium overdrive is a heavily modified , 3.3 volt pentium p54 core manufactured on 0.6 micrometer technology . it is fitted with a 486-compatible bus unit ( though with an increased pin-count ) , an integrated heatsink and fan , and 32 kb of cpu cache , double the 16 kb offered on regular p54c chips . intel announces first pentium ( tm ) overdrive ( tm ) processor , press release , google groups , february , 1995 . as the data bus was effectively reduced to 32-bit width , per-clock performance was much lower than that of a 'regular ' pentium , though still substantially faster compared to a similarly-clocked 486 owing to the pentium 's architectural improvements , such as the much improved fpu . it was also equipped with an integrated 3.3 volt power regulator as many 486 motherboards only provided 5 volt power . the 63 & nbsp ; mhz model was launched in february 1995 , and supported 25 & nbsp ; mhz bus systems . the much faster 83 & nbsp ; mhz version , which supported both 25 ( 63 & nbsp ; mhz effective ) and 33 & nbsp ; mhz bus systems , launched much later the same year on october , and was very expensive at 299 compared to other upgrade alternatives , such as those based on am5x86 and cyrix cx5x86 chips . crothers , brooke . system upgrades : intel plans overdrive for pentium systems . infoworld , september 11 , 1995 , vol . 17 , issue 37 . the processor 's heatsink is permanently attached , and the removable fan module is powered via spring-like metal prongs that connect to a trio of conductors on the surface of the chip . the clip that releases the fan is visible in the first photo , at the top left corner of the cpu . the central plastic '' column '' that leads from the center of the fan houses the fan wiring and leads down the side of the heatsink at this corner . the small plastic points at each top left of this column are the locking mechanism for the fan and are released by squeezing them . the opposite corner of the cpu has a latch that locks the fan around underneath the heatsink , by swinging into place upon assembly . the processor monitors the fan and will throttle back on clock speed to prevent overheating and damage if the fan is not operating . this is a predecessor to the internal temperature detection and protection in intel 's modern processors . compatibility and performance . during development , intel had changed the design specification , causing various compatibility and performance problems with some boards that were previously fully compatible . for instance , the packard bell 450 motherboard required a specially-designed interposer to be installed between the processor and the motherboard to cope with the changed specification , with the unfortunate consequence of precluding access to the motherboard 's level 2 cache , resulting in sub-par performance . ukt support page for the packard bell 450 motherboard in addition , some older chipsets do not support the write-back functionality of the chip 's level 1 cache , which could also reduce performance . however , the majority of socket 3 motherboards , particularly later ( post-1994 ) vlb and most pci boards , provide proper support for the pentium overdrive including fully operational access to the level 2 cache , and many earlier boards also support the processor with varying levels of compatibility and performance . performance-wise , many popular synthetic benchmarks of the time showed the pentium overdrive under-performing its much cheaper and higher-clocked rivals , though its real-world performance ( given the motherboard cache was being optimally used ) could be much different : programs that were floating-point dependent or optimized for the pentium architecture ( as were both becoming increasingly common in the mid to late nineties ) derived a more substantial benefit from the pentium overdrive , particularly the 83 & nbsp ; mhz version . in addition , it fully supported programs and operating systems specifically coded for the pentium architecture , such as many emulators , multimedia utilities and even later windows operating systems and games ; however , the benefit of running such programs on a clock- and motherboard bus-constrained system may be questionable . models . podp5v63 introduced february 3 , 1995 235 pins , p24t pinout 5 or 3.3 volts l1 cache 32 kb ( 16 kb + 16 kb ) 63 mhz on 25 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus ( 25 × 2.5 ) podp5v83 introduced october 1995 237 pins , p24t pinout 5 or 3.3 volts l1 cache 32 kb ( 16 kb + 16 kb ) 83 & nbsp ; mhz on 33 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus ( 33 × 2.5 ) some 63 cpu models ( part number 109x4405h6j05 ) have 234 pins instead of 235 . some cpus came with the pin chopped off ( pin a4 ) and others had the pin completely missing and covered with the encapsulation . images of 234 pin cpus . reference is the cpu in hand . pentium sockets . the original pentium chips ran at higher voltages than later models , with a slower 60 or 66 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus speed ( socket 4 , 5v ) . although little known , intel did in fact release an overdrive chip for these sockets , that used an internal clock multiplier of 2 , to change them to a '' 120/133 '' machine . podp5v120 : 120 & nbsp ; mhz on 60 & nbsp ; mhz bus podp5v133 : 133 & nbsp ; mhz on 66 & nbsp ; mhz bus or 120 & nbsp ; mhz on 60 & nbsp ; mhz bus the overdrive processors for the pentium 75 , 90 and 100 were also released ( socket 5 , 3.3 v ) , running at 125 , 150 and 166 & nbsp ; mhz ( clock multiplier of 2.5 ) . the 125 is an oddity , because intel never made a pentium 125 as a stand-alone processor . podp3v125 : 125 & nbsp ; mhz on 50 & nbsp ; mhz bus podp3v150 : 150 & nbsp ; mhz on 60 & nbsp ; mhz bus podp3v166 : 166 & nbsp ; mhz on 66 & nbsp ; mhz bus these were replaced by pentium overdrive & nbsp ; mmx , which also upgraded the pentium 120 - 200 & nbsp ; mhz to the faster version with mmx technology . podpmt66x200 : up to 200 & nbsp ; mhz on 66 & nbsp ; mhz bus ( clock multiplier of 3.0 ) podpmt66x166 : up to 166 & nbsp ; mhz on 66 & nbsp ; mhz bus ( clock multiplier of 2.5 ) podpmt60x180 : up to 180 & nbsp ; mhz on 60 & nbsp ; mhz bus ( clock multiplier of 3.0 ) podpmt60x150 : up to 150 & nbsp ; mhz on 60 & nbsp ; mhz bus ( clock multiplier of 2.5 ) . socket 8 . in 1998 the pentium ii overdrive , part number podp66x333 , was released as an upgrade path for pentium pro owners . this upgrade could be used in single and dual processor socket 8 systems , or in two sockets of quad processor socket 8 systems with cpu 3 and 4 removed . combining the pentium ii deschutes core in a flip-chip package with a 512 kb full speed l2 cache chip from the pentium ii xeon into a socket 8-compatible module resulted in a 300 or 333 & nbsp ; mhz processor that could run on a 60 or 66 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus . this combination brought together some of the more attractive aspects of the pentium ii and the pentium ii xeon : mmx support/improved 16-bit performance and full-speed l2 cache , respectively . the later '' dixon '' mobile pentium ii core would emulate this combination with its 256 kb of full-speed cache . in intel 's '' family/model/stepping '' scheme , the pentium ii overdrive cpu is family 6 , model 3 . though it was based on the deschutes core , when queried by the cpuid command , it identified as a klamath pentium ii . , wayback machine archive of heise , accessed april 12 , 2009 as noted in the pentium ii processor update documentation from intel , '' please note that although this processor has a cpuid of 163xh , it uses a pentium ii processor cpuid 065xh processor core . '' specification update for the pentium ii processor , page 15 , note 3 the major customer for the production of these chips was sandia national laboratories 's asci red supercomputer , which had all 4,510 cpus upgraded in 1999 . after the upgrade the system was once again the world 's fastest on the top500 . see also . intel 80486 overdrive rapidcad . references . external links . intel pentium overdrive pictures of pentium overdrive intel pentium overdrive support page
