The Jesus and Mary Chain

biography . early years . brothers jim and william reid had been inspired to form a band as far back as 1977 , having heard groups of the british punk scene ; in the early 1980s they formed their own . william stated , '' it was perfect timing because there were n't any guitar bands . everybody was making this electronic pop music . '' before forming the band , the brothers had spent five years on the dole , during which they wrote and recorded songs at home and worked out the sound and image of the band . originally called the poppy seeds , and then death of joey , they initially told journalists that they had taken their eventual name from a line in a bing crosby film , although six months later they admitted that this was not true . other accounts suggest that the name derived from an offer on a breakfast cereal packet , where customers could send off for a gold jesus & mary chain . the brothers started recording and sending demos to record companies in 1983 ( using a portastudio bought with £300 given to them by their father from redundancy pay after he lost his factory job ) , and by early 1984 they had recruited bass player douglas hart and teenage drummer murray dalglish . early influences included the velvet underground , the stooges , and the shangri-las , william stating in 1985 , '' we all love the shangri-las , and one day we 're going to make shangri-las records . '' jim mentioned his liking for pink floyd , siouxsie and the banshees , the monkees and muddy waters . early demos displayed a similarity to the ramones , prompting the brothers to add another element to their sound ; in william 's words : '' that 's why we started using noise and feedback . we want to make records that sound different . '' they began playing live in spring 1984 . in the early days william reid 's guitar would be left out of tune , while dalglish 's drum kit was limited to two drums , and hart 's bass guitar only had three strings , down to two by 1985 ; in hart 's words , '' that 's the two i use . i mean , what 's the fucking point spending money on another two ? two is enough . '' sky news interview , 1985 struggling to get gigs , the band took to turning up at venues claiming to be the support band , playing their short set and making a quick exit . after failing to generate any interest from concert promoters and record labels in scotland , the band relocated to fulham , london , in may 1984 , and soon afterwards their demo tape was passed to fellow scot alan mcgee by bobby gillespie . subsequently , mcgee promoted a gig for the band at the living room in london in june 1984 . on the strength of hearing the band sound check , mcgee signed them to his creation records label on a one-off deal , and mcgee also became the band 's manager . their debut single , '' upside down '' , was recorded in october and released in november that year . the sessions were produced by joe foster , but mcgee , unsatisfied with foster 's work , remixed the a-side , although the b-side , a cover version of syd barrett 's '' vegetable man '' , remained credited to foster . the band were gaining increasing attention from the music press at this time with neil taylor of the nme describing them as '' the best band in the world '' . dalglish left in november 1984 after a dispute over money and was replaced shortly afterwards by bobby gillespie who had also formed primal scream two years earlier in 1982 . '' upside down '' topped the uk indie chart in february 1985 and then again in march and stayed on the chart for 76 weeks , selling around 35,000 copies in total , making it one of the biggest-selling indie singles of the 1980s . playing in front of small audiences , during early shows the mary chain performed very short gigs , typically fuelled by amphetamines and lasting around 20 minutes , and played with their backs to the audience , refusing to speak to them . in late december 1984 , the band performed as part of the ica rock week . during their performance , bottles were thrown on stage , with press reports exaggerating events and claiming that there had been a riot , and national newspaper the sun running a story on the band concentrating on violence and drugs , the band attracting the tag '' the new sex pistols '' . this led several local councils to ban the band from performing in their area . psychocandy . the success of '' upside down '' led to interest from wea-subsidiary blanco y negro records which signed the group in early 1985 . the group released the single '' never understand '' in february which reached number forty-seven in the uk singles chart . the label had initially refused to press the single due to its b-side , '' suck '' , but went ahead given the alternative put forward by the band , a song called '' jesus fuck '' . the band were eager to get '' jesus fuck '' released , and alan mcgee got as far as producing test pressings of a re-issue of '' upside down '' with the song on the b-side , before the band insisted that blanco y negro include the track on their next single . the follow-up , '' you trip me up '' , was delayed due to staff at the pressing plant refusing to press it due to the presence of the song , now re-titled '' jesus suck '' ; the single was released in june 1985 with a new b-side , '' just out of reach '' . john peel got the band to record a second session for his bbc radio 1 show in february 1985 ( the first was only a few months earlier ) , and the band also made a tv appearance on whistle test in march and the tube the same year . the third single for blanco y negro , '' just like honey '' , released in october , gave them their biggest hit to date , reaching no . & nbsp ; 45 . eager to avoid the violence of earlier gigs and to give an opportunity for their songs to be heard without distortion and feedback , the band planned to perform several unannounced acoustic sets supporting sonic youth , but this was abandoned when the plans were leaked . their debut album psychocandy followed in november that year . the album fused together the reids ' two primary influences : the guitar noise of the stooges and the velvet underground with the pop songwriting and melodies of the beach boys , the shangri-las and phil spector ; in fact , the album 's opening song , '' just like honey , '' borrows hal blaine 's famous drum intro from the ronettes 1963 classic , '' be my baby '' , produced and co-written by spector . the record received unanimously positive reviews and is now considered a landmark recording . drummer gillespie announced his departure from the band in october 1985 , to concentrate on primal scream . he had recorded most of the drums on psychocandy , with john moore filling in when gillespie was unavailable , eventually joining the band to replace him . john loder also acted as a stand-in drummer when gillespie was unavailable for live performances . when the band signed to wea subsidiary blanco y negro in january 1985 , there were stories reporting that they had stolen money from managing director rob dickens 's jacket and destroyed his office , all untrue but seen as good publicity by manager mcgee . in a performance on belgian television in march 1985 , the band did smash the set and the audio equipment , but this was at the request of the tv producer . such behaviour became expected of the band and many shows culminated with the reids trashing their equipment , which was often followed by the audience throwing projectiles onto the stage and damaging equipment . on 15 march 1985 , the jesus and mary chain played a gig at the north london polytechnic in front of one of their largest crowds up to that point . the organizers had overbooked the venue , leaving hundreds of fans locked outside . when gillespie and hart attempted to break the locks , the police were called . support band meat whiplash had stirred up violence before the mary chain set foot onto the stage when singer paul mcdermott threw an empty wine bottle into the audience , prompting four members of the crowd to attack him , leading to their set being abandoned . second act the jasmine minks got through their set without incident , but the jesus and mary chain then kept the audience waiting for over an hour before taking the stage , and then left the stage after playing for less than twenty minutes . members of the audience began throwing cans at where the band were hiding behind the stage curtains , before mounting the stage to smash the equipment that remained there . the violence continued for some time before police eventually took control . the venue blamed the band 's late appearance and two equipment breakdowns , while mcgee issued a statement saying that '' the audience were not smashing up the hall , they were smashing up pop music '' , going on to say '' this is truly art as terrorism '' . the violence soon started to become a hindrance to the band , with people attending concerts simply for the violence rather than the music , william commenting '' i hate it , i despise it . it gets in the way in terms of getting more gigs , and it gets in the way of our image '' . many performances were cancelled during the remainder of 1985 , with promoters or local councils not prepared to risk a riot . the violence flared up again at a performance at the electric ballroom in camden town in september , with bottles thrown at the band while they played , and a section of the audience smashing up the amplification equipment and smashing the lights afterwards , with several people injured by flying glass . a major factor in the audience reaction was the length of the band 's sets at the time , which lasted less than twenty-five minutes , jim explaining this with '' there 's never been a group good enough to play any longer '' . lack of songs was also a factor , according to jim : '' we 've only got enough songs to play for that long '' . after the success of the album in the uk , the band embarked on a tour of the united states in late 1985 and 1986 , followed by a tour of japan . on returning to the uk they toured the uk , this time without the trouble that had marred earlier performances . the band revived their acoustic intentions with a stripped-down session for john peel in november 1985 , which included '' psychocandy '' , the original album title track that was omitted from the release , and '' some candy talking '' , a song which they had been performing for over a year , but had left off the album . a second version of '' some candy talking '' was issued on a free ep issued with the nme in january 1986 , and the song was released as the band 's next single in july . it reached number thirteen in the uk singles chart , but attracted controversy when bbc radio 1 dj mike smith decided that the song was a paean to illegal drugs ( denied by the band at the time , but admitted by william a year later ) and convinced the station to ban it from being played . darklands and automatic . in september 1986 , the band parted ways with manager alan mcgee , and came close to splitting up later in the year , with jim reid suffering from '' exhaustion '' . john moore had become an established member , but moved to rhythm guitar , with former redskins member martin hewes joining the band briefly ( although he strongly denies ever joining ) and former dead can dance percussionist james pinker taking over on drums . blanco y negro manager geoff travis took over management duties , and the band returned in december with two gigs at the national ballroom in kilburn , where they premiered new songs including '' april skies '' and '' hit '' . early in 1987 , they entered the studio to record their second album . the first fruits of these sessions were released on the '' april skies '' single in april , which saw the band have their first top ten hit . the beach boys influence was evident on the b-side , which included '' kill surf city '' , a reworking of brian wilson 's '' surf city '' . the various formats released also included a cover of bo diddley 's '' who do you love ? '' , a tribute to him with '' bo diddley is jesus '' , and a live version of can 's '' mushroom '' . '' happy when it rains '' was the second pre-album single , strongly influenced by smokey robinson 's '' my girl '' , but it failed to match the success of '' april skies '' , only reaching number twenty-five . the band set out on another uk tour , this time with sets stretching to 45 minutes , although to a mixed reaction from the music press . they toured without a drummer , instead using a drum machine . the band 's second album , darklands , was released during the tour , in september , described by writer steve taylor as '' the definitive blend of light and shade '' . featuring a more melodic sound , the album was recorded almost entirely by the reids themselves , replacing live drums with a drum machine , and received overwhelmingly positive reviews by the british music press . the album 's title track was released as a single in october , and the band were thrown off the itv music show the roxy when they failed to mime well enough to it . the band 's dangerous reputation culminated at a gig at the rpm club in toronto in november 1987 , when after being heckled throughout the gig by a group in the audience , jim reid thrust his microphone stand towards them , hitting one on the head . jim was arrested and spent a night in jail , before being bailed to return the following february . he was subsequently given an absolute discharge after agreeing to give around £500 to a salvation army charity and apologise to the complainant . with the court case hanging over the band , they compiled a collection of b-sides and rarities for release in april 1988 as barbed wire kisses . they also selected live tracks from a detroit concert the previous november for release while they planned further studio work . dave evans , former mary chain soundman and bass player with biff bang pow ! ( which also featured alan mcgee and dick green of creation records ) was recruited in september 1987 to replace moore , who formed john moore and the expressway . richard thomas joined on drums in early 1988 . the band had been using drum tapes on tour before thomas . their next release was the new recording '' sidewalking '' , released in march 1988 , and backed by some the live tracks , followed a month later by barbed wire kisses . later that year , they did a remix for the single '' birthday '' by the sugarcubes . in september 1989 , the band provided backing vocals for the erasure single '' drama ! '' . the band 's third studio album automatic was released in october 1989 , by which time evans had been replaced by ben lurie . boasting heavy use of synthesized bass and keyboards , the album was not received quite as well as its predecessors . it contained the singles '' head on '' and '' blues from a gun '' . by this time , the violence that was originally associated with the band was practically non-existent and the reid brothers were less antagonistic and aggressive in general . the rollercoaster ep ( august 1990 ) would be their last release for over a year , the band undertaking rollercoaster tour with my bloody valentine , dinosaur jr . and blur . the 1990s . douglas hart had moonlighted with the acid angels in 1988 , and left the band in 1991 , to have a career in film making , before picking up his bass again in 2006 , playing with the sian alice group , le volume courbe and cristine . daly , steven ( 1992 ) '' teenage fanclub '' , spin , january 1992 , p . 36 rubiner , julie m .

' i wan na die just like jesus , i wan na die on a bed of spikes ' ) . the single was followed by the release of the album honey 's dead ( 1992 ) , which received mixed reviews . following the rollercoaster tour to support the album , the band concentrated on cracking the united states , with an appearance on david letterman 's show , and a tour as part of the lollapalooza line-up , which william later described as '' the worst experience of our lives , '' followed by their own headlining tour . in december 1992 , the reids again lost their rhythm section , with ben lurie returning and steve monti joining on drums . another compilation was released in 1993 , the sound of speed , before they returned to the studio to record their fifth album proper , stoned & dethroned which would see release in 1994 , and featured guest appearances from shane macgowan and william 's then-girlfriend hope sandoval . the album was originally planned as an acoustic album , but this idea was abandoned because , in jim 's words , '' we could n't do enough interesting things with acoustic guitars to make an album '' . in the 1995 ep released under american records , a number of new works and b-sides were published which were later collected in the album munki . following the release of the 1995 compilation hate rock ' n ' roll , the mary chain parted ways with blanco y negro , their record label of over a decade , and re-signed to their original label creation records , and sub pop in america . the band now included former lush bassist phil king . they then recorded 1998 's munki album , which would turn out to be their last before splitting the following year . munki was commercially the least successful album the band released , peaking at number forty-seven in the uk album chart . the album featured the reid 's sister linda , who sang on the track '' mo tucker '' as well as vocals from hope sandoval on '' perfume '' . though it was not until october 1999 that the split was made official , on 12 september 1998 , william had a falling out in the tour bus with guitarist ben lurie before they were to play a sold out performance at the famous los angeles house of blues . jim appeared onstage apparently drunk and barely able to stand or sing . william walked offstage about 15 minutes into their set , and the show ended . the audience was later refunded the price of their tickets . the band finished up their u.s . and japanese dates without william , but from that point , it was clear that the band was at its end . jim reid said in 2006 of the tension between himself and william : '' after each tour we wanted to kill each other , and after the final tour we tried '' . . post-split . immediately after the split , william reid went solo as lazycame—having already released a solo ep in april 1998—and jim reid founded freeheat along with lurie and ex-gun club bassist romi mori and earl brutus drummer nick sanderson , although neither act received much attention or found any success . in october 2005 , it was announced that the reids were reunited ; jim reid 's track '' song for a secret '' a duet with his wife julie barber , was released as a single , paired up with sister vanilla 's '' ca n't stop the rock '' , which was written and produced by william reid and the brothers ' younger sibling , linda . the single was released by transistor records on 17 october . jim reid promoted his side of the single with a very rare solo gig at london 's sonic cathedral club on john peel day , thursday 13 october 2005 . he finished this rare live appearance with a performance of the early mary chain classic '' never understand '' . jim reid also performed new material at low-key gigs with a new band comprising phil king on guitar , loz colbert ( ride ) on drums and bassist mark crozer ( international jetsetters ) . in 2006 five albums were reissued through rhino records : psychocandy , darklands , automatic , honey 's dead and stoned & dethroned on 11 july 2006 . each album was released with a dvd containing three promo videos from that particular album . . reunion : 2007-present . they performed at coachella 2007 in april . during their 27 april 2007 main-stage performance , they were joined onstage for the song '' just like honey '' by actress scarlett johansson ( who acted in the film lost in translation , which featured the song ) . at the warm up gig on 26 april 2007 , in pomona , california , they were instead joined by annie hardy of giant drag . the jesus & mary chain news on yahoo !
