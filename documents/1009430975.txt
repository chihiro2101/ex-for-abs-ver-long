John Betjeman

after the second world war . betjeman 's wife penelope became a roman catholic in 1948 . the couple drifted apart and in 1951 he met lady elizabeth cavendish , with whom he developed an immediate and lifelong friendship . by 1948 betjeman had published more than a dozen books . five of these were verse collections , including one in the usa . sales of his collected poems in 1958 reached 100,000 . the popularity of the book prompted ken russell to make a film about him , john betjeman : a poet in london ( 1959 ) . filmed in 35 & nbsp ; mm and running 11 minutes and 35 seconds , it was first shown on the bbc 's monitor . in 1953 his address was the old rectory , farnborough , wantage , berkshire . he continued writing guidebooks and works on architecture during the 1960s and 1970s and started broadcasting . he was a founder member of the victorian society ( 1958 ) . betjeman was closely associated with the culture and spirit of metro-land , as outer reaches of the metropolitan railway were known before the war . in 1973 he made a widely acclaimed television documentary for the bbc called metro-land , directed by edward mirzoeff . on the centenary of betjeman 's birth in 2006 , his daughter led two celebratory railway trips : from london to bristol , and through metro-land , to quainton road . in 1974 , betjeman and mirzoeff followed up metro-land with a passion for churches , a celebration of betjeman 's beloved church of england , filmed entirely in the diocese of norwich . in 1975 , he proposed that the fine rooms of somerset house should house the turner bequest , so helping to scupper the plan of the minister for the arts for a theatre museum to be housed there . in 1977 the bbc broadcast '' the queen 's realm : a prospect of england '' , an aerial anthology of english landscape , music and poetry , selected by betjeman and produced by edward mirzoeff , in celebration of the queen 's silver jubilee . betjeman was fond of the ghost stories of m.r . james and supplied an introduction to peter haining 's book m . r . james & nbsp ; – book of the supernatural . he was susceptible to the supernatural ; diana mitford tells the story of betjeman staying at her country home , biddesden house , in the 1920s . she says , '' he had a terrifying dream , that he was handed a card with wide black edges , and on it his name was engraved , and a date . he knew this was the date of his death '' . for the last decade of his life betjeman suffered increasingly from parkinson 's disease . he died at his home in trebetherick , cornwall , on 19 may 1984 , aged 77 , and is buried nearby at st enodoc 's church . . poetry . betjeman 's poems are often humorous , and in broadcasting he exploited his bumbling and fogeyish image . his wryly comic verse is accessible and has attracted a great following for its satirical and observant grace . auden said in his introduction to slick but not streamlined , '' so at home with the provincial gaslit towns , the seaside lodgings , the bicycle , the harmonium . '' his poetry is similarly redolent of time and place , continually seeking out intimations of the eternal in the manifestly ordinary . there are constant evocations of the physical chaff and clutter that accumulates in everyday life , the miscellanea of an england now gone but not beyond the reach of living memory . he talks of ovaltine and sturmey-archer bicycle gears . '' oh ! fuller 's angel cake , robertson 's marmalade , '' he writes , '' liberty lampshades , come shine on us all . '' in a 1962 radio interview he told teenage questioners that he could not write about 'abstract things ' , preferring places , and faces . philip larkin wrote of his work , '' how much more interesting & worth writing about betjeman 's subjects are than most other modern poets , i mean , whether so-and-so achieves some metaphysical inner unity is not really so interesting to us as the overbuilding of rural middlesex '' . betjeman was an anglican and his religious beliefs come through in some of his poems . in a letter written on christmas day 1947 , he said : “ also my view of the world is that man is born to fulfil the purposes of his creator i.e . to praise his creator , to stand in awe of him and to dread him . in this way i differ from most modern poets , who are agnostics and have an idea that man is the centre of the universe or is a helpless bubble blown about by uncontrolled forces . '' he combined piety with a nagging uncertainty about the truth of christianity . unlike thomas hardy , who disbelieved in the truth of the christmas story while hoping it might be so , betjeman affirms his belief even while fearing it might be false . in the poem '' christmas '' , one of his most openly religious pieces , the last three stanzas that proclaim the wonder of christ 's birth do so in the form of a question '' and is it true . ? '' his views on christianity were expressed in his poem '' the conversion of st . paul '' , a response to a radio broadcast by humanist margaret knight : betjeman became poet laureate of the united kingdom in 1972 , the first knight bachelor to be appointed ( the only other , sir william davenant , was knighted after his appointment ) . this role , combined with his popularity as a television performer , ensured that his poetry reached an audience enormous by the standards of the time . similarly to tennyson , he appealed to a wide public and managed to voice the thoughts and aspirations of many ordinary people while retaining the respect of many of his fellow poets . this is partly because of the apparently simple traditional metrical structures and rhymes he uses . in the early 1970s , he began a recording career of four albums on charisma records which included betjeman 's banana blush ( 1974 ) and late flowering love ( 1974 ) , where his poetry reading is set to music with overdubbing by leading musicians of the time . mojo no 187 pp122 his recording catalogue extends to nine albums , four singles and two compilations . betjeman and slough . prompted by the rapid development of the buckinghamshire town before world war ii , betjeman wrote the ten-stanza poem slough to express his dismay at the industrialisation of britain . he later came to regret having written it . the poem was first included in his 1937 collection continual dew . betjeman and architecture . betjeman had a fondness for victorian architecture at a time when it was unfashionable and was a founding member of the victorian society . he wrote on this subject in first and last loves ( 1952 ) and more extensively in london 's historic railway stations in 1972 , defending the beauty of 12 stations . he led the campaign to save holy trinity , sloane street , in london when it was threatened with demolition in the early 1970s . he fought a spirited but unsuccessful campaign to save the propylaeum , known commonly as the euston arch , london . he is considered instrumental in helping to save st pancras railway station , london , and was commemorated when it became an international terminus for eurostar in november 2007 . he called the plan to demolish st pancras a '' criminal folly '' . about it he wrote , '' what the londoner sees in his mind 's eye is that cluster of towers and pinnacles seen from pentonville hill and outlined against a foggy sunset and the great arc of barlow 's train shed gaping to devour incoming engines and the sudden burst of exuberant gothic of the hotel seen from gloomy judd street '' . on the reopening of st pancras station in 2007 , the statue of john betjeman was commissioned from curators futurecity . a proposal by artist martin jennings was selected from a shortlist . the finished work was erected in the station at platform level , including a series of slate roundels depicting selections of betjeman 's writings . betjeman was given the remaining two-year lease on victorian gothic architect william burges 's tower house in holland park upon leaseholder mrs e . r . b . graham 's death in 1962 . betjeman felt he could not afford the financial implications of taking over the house permanently , with his potential liability for £10,000 of renovations upon the expiry of the lease . after damage from vandals , restoration began in 1966 . betjeman 's lease included furniture from the house by burges and betjeman gave three pieces , the zodiac settle , the narcissus washstand and the philosophy cabinet , to evelyn waugh . betjeman responded to architecture as the visible manifestation of society 's spiritual life as well as its political and economic structure . he attacked speculators and bureaucrats for what he saw as their rapacity and lack of imagination . in the preface of his collection of architectural essays first and last loves he wrote in a bbc film made in 1968 but not broadcast at that time , betjeman described the sound of leeds to be of '' victorian buildings crashing to the ground '' . he went on to lambast john poulson 's british railways house ( now city house ) , saying how it blocked all the light out to city square and was only a testament to money with no architectural merit . he also praised the architecture of leeds town hall . in 1969 betjeman contributed the foreword to derek linstrum 's historic architecture of leeds . betjeman was for over 20 years a trustee of the bath preservation trust and was vice-president from 1965 to 1971 , at a time when bath—a city rich in georgian architecture—was coming under increasing pressure from modern developers and a road had been proposed to cut across it . he also created a short television documentary called architecture of bath , in which he voiced his concerns about the way the city 's architectural heritage was being mistreated . from 1946 to 1948 he had served as secretary to the oxford preservation trust . betjeman was also instrumental in saving the duke of cornwall hotel in plymouth . legacy . prizes . the society for the protection of ancient buildings annually presents a
