Battle of Ocaña

background . maneuvers . the spanish campaign in the autumn of 1809 called for their armies to lunge at madrid from both north and south . they called for assistance from arthur wellesley , viscount wellington , but after experiencing a lack of cooperation from the spanish during the talavera campaign the british general refused . the french were nearly surprised by the southern thrust . by 9 november , the southern army was within 35 miles of madrid with only 7,000 french troops blocking them . then aréizaga lost his nerve and halted for three days . he then pressed on toward madrid but ran into two french divisions and pulled back . several days of fruitless countermarching found the thoroughly alerted french concentrated and moving to intercept the spanish army . glover , p 115 . spanish army . aréizaga commanded 51,000 men chandler , p 319 ;

'' napier , vol ii , pp . 248-249 . . positions . west of ocaña town , aréizaga placed josé pascual de zayas y chacón 's vanguard and rivas 's cavalry . from ocaña to the east , the spanish commander aligned his center and right . the right flank , which hung in air , was held by freire 's remaining three cavalry divisions . from there to ocaña , luis roberto de lacy , castejon , pedro agustín girón and vigodet held the front line . their battalions were arranged in a double line . in reserve behind castejon stood jacome 's men , zerain supported giron and copons backed up vigodet . the royal guard and one brigade of dessolles stood north of ocaña , facing across a deep ravine . the next unit to the east was louis rey 's brigade of dessolles . gazan and girard of the v corps , leval and werlé of iv corps , and the cavalry completed the line to the east . soult massed 30 cannons near dessolles and the v corps ' positions . zimmermann , p 22-23 . battle . on 19 november , the massed battery pounded the spanish center as leval attacked castejon and werlé went in against lacy 's division . at first the spanish swung their line back . then , as the iv corps halted to wait for artillery to be brought up , the two spanish divisions surged forward into musket range and opened fire . the dutch , germans and poles began to edge rearward . soult ordered up girard 's division to support the wavering iv corps battalions . while this was going on , milhaud 's dragoons , supported by woirgard and paris , moved rapidly toward the vulnerable spanish right flank . screened by olive groves , they suddenly appeared in front of freire 's command . the french charged and soon routed the spanish horsemen . milhaud , paris and woirgard neatly wheeled their squadrons and tore into the unprotected flank of lacy 's infantry . soult sent the french line forward . the massed battery savaged the spanish line with renewed fury . faced by the threat of infantry pressing their front while cavalry slashed into their flank , the spanish divisions collapsed one after another and bolted for the rear . at this crisis , dessolles and the royal guard dashed across the ravine and burst into ocaña , severing the spanish left from their disintegrating center and right . as the spanish army streamed away to the south , only zayas 's division remained intact to cover the retreat . soult 's cavalry pressed the pursuit and broke zayas later in the day . results . the french captured 14,000 spaniards , 50 cannon , 30 flags and the entire baggage train . another 4,000 were killed and wounded . french losses were 2,000 killed and wounded . paris was killed and girard wounded . this catastrophe temporarily laid spain open to french domination . the northern spanish army was beaten a week later at the battle of alba de tormes . the way was open for the french conquest of andalusia . footnotes . bibliography . glover , michael . the peninsular war 1807-1814 . london : penguin , 2001 . napier , william . history of the war in the peninsula and the south of france , from the year 1807 to the year 1814 ( 1873 ) new york : d . & j . sadlier . smith , digby . the napoleonic wars data book . london : greenhill , 1993 . zimmermann , dick .
