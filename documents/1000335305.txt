Andy Devine

early life . devine was born in flagstaff , arizona , on october 7 , 1905 . he grew up in kingman , arizona , where his family moved when he was one year old . his father was thomas devine , jr . , born in 1869 in kalamazoo county , michigan . andy 's grandfather , thomas devine , sr . , was born in 1842 in county tipperary , ireland , and immigrated to the united states in 1852 . andy 's mother was amy ward , a granddaughter of commander james h . ward , the first officer of the united states navy killed during the civil war . devine was a republican . he attended st . mary 's college in leavenworth , kansas , st . benedict 's college in atchison , kansas , and northern arizona state teacher 's college ( now northern arizona university ) , and was a football player at santa clara university . corneau , ernest n . ( 1969 ) . the hall of fame of western film stars . christopher publishing house . p . 234 . he also played semiprofessional football under the pseudonym jeremiah schwartz . his football experience led to his first sizable film role in the spirit of notre dame in 1931 . . career . devine had an ambition to act , so after college , he went to hollywood , where he worked as a lifeguard at venice beach , in easy distance of the studios . while filming doctor bull at fox studios in 1933 , he met dorothy house ( 1915-2000 ) . they were married on october 28 , 1933 , in las vegas , nevada , and remained united until his death , on february 18 , 1977 . they had two children : timothy andrew ( tad ) devine and dennis patrick gabriel devine . his peculiar wheezy voice was first thought likely to prevent him from moving to the talkies , but instead , it became his trademark . devine claimed that his distinctive voice resulted from a childhood accident in which he fell while running with a curtain rod in his mouth at the beale hotel in kingman , causing the rod to pierce the roof of his mouth . when he was able to speak again , he had a labored , scratchy , duo-tone voice . a biographer , however , indicated that this was one of several stories devine fabricated about his voice . his son tad related in an interview for encore westerns channel ( jim beaver , reporting from the 2007 newport beach film festival ) that there indeed had been an accident , but he was uncertain if it resulted in his father 's unusual voice . when asked if he had strange nodes on his vocal cords , devine replied , '' i 've got the same nodes as bing crosby , but his are in tune . '' devine first attempted stand-up comedy , as he was part of a vegas act called three fat guys , along with david arvedon and jackie gleason . they would have back-and-forth banter on stage revolving around second-rate jokes , which did not get much reaction from the audience . after devine and gleason left this act , devine later appeared in more than 400 films and shared with walter brennan , another character actor , the rare ability to move with ease from b-movie westerns to feature films . his notable roles included cookie , roy rogers 's sidekick , in 10 films ; a role in romeo and juliet ( 1936 ) , stanley , john .
