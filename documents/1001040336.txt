Naïve art

characteristics . naïve art nathalia brodskaïa l'art naïf éd . parkstone international is often seen as outsider art that is by someone without formal ( or little ) training or degree . while this was true before the twentieth century , there are now academies for naïve art . naïve art is now a fully recognized art genre , represented in art galleries worldwide . the characteristics of naïve art are an awkward relationship to the formal qualities of painting , especially not respecting the three rules of the perspective ( such as defined by the progressive painters of the renaissance ) : decrease of the size of objects proportionally with distance , muting of colors with distance , decrease of the precision of details with distance , the results are : effects of perspective geometrically erroneous ( awkward aspect of the works , children 's drawings look , or medieval painting look , but the comparison stops there ) strong use of pattern , unrefined color on all the plans of the composition , without enfeeblement in the background , an equal accuracy brought to details , including those of the background which should be shaded off . simplicity rather than subtlety are all supposed markers of naïve art . it has , however , become such a popular and recognizable style that many examples could be called pseudo-naïve . whereas naïve art ideally describes the work of an artist who did not receive formal education in an art school or academy , for example henri rousseau or alfred wallis , 'pseudo naïve ' or 'faux naïve ' art describes the work of an artist working in a more imitative or self-conscious mode and whose work can be seen as more imitative than original . strict naïvety is unlikely to be found in contemporary artists , given the expansion of autodidactism as a form of education in modern times . naïve categorizations are not always welcome by living artists , but this is likely to change as dignifying signals are known . museums devoted to naïve art now exist in kecskemét , hungary ; kovačica , serbia ; riga , latvia ; jaen , spain ; rio de janeiro , brasil ; vicq france and paris . examples of english-speaking living artists who acknowledge their naïve style are : gary bunt , lyle carbajal , gabe langholtz , gigi mills , barbara olsen , paine proffitt , and alain thomas . '' primitive art '' is another term often applied to art by those without formal training , but is historically more often applied to work from certain cultures that have been judged socially or technologically '' primitive '' by western academia , such as native american , subsaharan african or pacific island art ( see tribal art ) . this is distinguished from the self-conscious , '' primitive '' inspired movement primitivism . another term related to ( but not completely synonymous with ) naïve art is folk art . there also exist the terms '' naïvism '' and '' primitivism '' which are usually applied to professional painters working in the style of naïve art ( like paul gauguin , mikhail larionov , paul klee ) . irina arnoldova . painter sergey zagraevsky : the view of an art critic . movements . nobody knows exactly when the first naive artists appeared on the scene , as from the very first manifestations of art right up to the days of the '' modern classic '' , naive artists quite unconsciously bequeathed us unmistakable signs of their creative activity . at all events , naive art can be regarded as having occupied an '' official '' position in the annals of twentieth-century art since – at the very latest – the publication of the der blaue reiter , an almanac in 1912 . wassily kandinsky and franz marc , who brought out the almanac , presented 6 reproductions of paintings by le douanier ' rousseau ( henri rousseau ) , comparing them with other pictorial examples . however , most experts agree that the year that naive art was '' discovered '' was 1885 , when the painter paul signac became aware of the talents of henri rousseau and set about organizing exhibitions of his work in a number of prestigious galleries . . earth group . the earth group ( grupa zemlja ) were croatian artists , architects and intellectuals active in zagreb from 1929 to 1935 . the group was marxist in orientation and was partly modelled on '' neue sachlichkeit '' , leading to more stylized forms , and the emergence of naive painting . the group included the painters krsto hegedušić , edo kovačević , omer mujadžić , kamilo ružička , ivan tabaković , and oton postružnik , the sculptors antun augustinčić , frano kršinić , and the architect drago ibler . the earth group searched for answers to social issues . their program emphasised the importance of independent creative expression , and opposed the uncritical copying of foreign styles . rather than producing art for art 's sake , they felt it ought to reflect the reality of life and the needs of the modern community . activities at the group 's exhibitions were increasingly provocative to the government of the day , and in 1935 the group was banned . . hlebine school . a term applied to croatian naive painters working in or around the village of hlebine , near the hungarian border , from about 1930 . at this time , according to the world encyclopedia of naive art ( 1984 ) , the village amounted to little more than ' a few muddy winding streets and one-storey houses ' , but it produced such a remarkable crop of artists that it became virtually synonymous with yugoslav naive painting . hlebine is a small picturesque municipality in the north of croatia that in 1920s became a setting against which a group of self-taught peasants began to develop a unique and somewhat revolutionary style of painting . this was instigated by leading intellectuals of the time such as the poet antun gustav matoš and the biggest name in croatian literature , miroslav krleža , who called for an individual national artistic style that would be independent from western influences . these ideas were picked up by a celebrated artist from hlebine – krsto hegedušić and he went on to found the hlebine school of art in 1930 in search of national “ rural artistic expression ” . ivan generalić was the first master of the hlebine school , and the first to develop a distinctive personal style , achieving a high standard in his art . after the second world war , the next generation of hlebine painters tended to focus more on stylized depictions of country life taken from imagination . generalić continued to be the dominant figure , and encouraged younger artists , including his son josip generalić . the hlebine school became a worldwide phenomenon with the 1952 venice biennale and exhibitions in brazil and brussels . some of the best known naive artists are dragan gaži , ivan generalić , josip generalić , krsto hegedušić , mijo kovačić , ivan lacković-croata , franjo mraz , ivan večenaj and mirko virius . artists . 18th century . oluf braren ( 1787–1839 ) justus dalee ( 1793–1878 ) edward hicks ( 1780–1849 ) joshua johnson ( 1763–1824 ) . 19th century .
