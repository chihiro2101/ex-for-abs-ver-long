'' james , p . 59 . . wakr akron . in 1945 , alan freed joined wakr ( 1590 & nbsp ; am ) in akron , ohio and became a local favorite , playing hot jazz and pop recordings . the radio editor for the akron beacon journal followed freed and his '' request review '' nightly program of dance . when he left the station , the non-compete clause in his contract limited his ability to find work elsewhere , and he was forced to take the graveyard shift at cleveland 's wjw radio where he eventually made history playing the music he called '' rock and roll '' . . wjw cleveland . in the late 1940s , while working at wakr , freed met cleveland record store owner leo mintz . record rendezvous , one of cleveland 's largest record stores , had begun selling rhythm and blues records . mintz told freed that he had noticed increased interest in the records at his store , and encouraged him to play them on the radio . jackson , p . 35 . freed moved to cleveland in 1951 , still under a non-compete clause with wakr . however , in april , through the help of william shipley , rca 's northern ohio distributor , he was released from the non-compete clause . he was then hired by wjw radio for a midnight program sponsored by main line , the rca distributor , and record rendezvous . freed peppered his speech with hipster language , and , with a rhythm and blues record called '' moondog '' as his theme song , broadcast r & b hits into the night . mintz proposed buying airtime on cleveland radio station wjw ( 850 & nbsp ; am ) , which would be devoted entirely to r & b recordings , with freed as host . on july 11 , 1951 , freed began playing rhythm and blues records on wjw . miller , pp . 57–61 . while r & b records were played for many years on lower powered , inner city radio stations aimed at african-americans , this is arguably the first time that authentic r & b was featured regularly on a major , mass audience station . freed called his show '' the moondog house '' and billed himself as '' the king of the moondoggers '' . he had been inspired by an offbeat instrumental called '' moondog symphony '' that had been recorded by new york street musician louis t . hardin , aka '' moondog '' . freed adopted the record as his show 's theme music . his on-air manner was energetic , in contrast to many contemporary radio presenters of traditional pop music , who tended to sound more subdued and low-key in manner . he addressed his listeners as if they were all part of a make-believe kingdom of hipsters , united in their love for black music . he also began popularizing the phrase '' rock and roll '' to describe the music he played . bordowitz , p . 63 . thumb later that year , freed promoted dances and concerts featuring the music he was playing on the radio . he was one of the organizers of a five-act show called '' moondog coronation ball '' on march 21 , 1952 , at the cleveland arena . this event is now considered to have been the first major rock and roll concert . crowds attended in numbers far beyond the arena 's capacity , and the concert was shut down early due to overcrowding and a near-riot . freed gained a priceless notoriety from the incident . wjw immediately increased the airtime allotted to freed 's program , and his popularity soared . in those days , cleveland was considered by the music industry to be a '' breakout '' city , where national trends first appeared in a regional market . freed 's popularity made the pop music business take notice . soon , tapes of freed 's program , moondog , began to air in the new york city area over station wnjr & nbsp ; 1430 ( now wnsw ) , in newark , new jersey . . new york stations . in july 1954 , following his success on the air in cleveland , freed moved to wins ( 1010 & nbsp ; am ) in new york city . hardin , the original moondog , later took a court action suit against wins for damages against freed for infringement in 1956 , arguing prior claim to the name '' moondog '' , under which he had been composing since 1947 . hardin collected a 6,000 judgment from freed , as well as an agreement to give up further usage of the name moondog . scotto , robert ( 2007 ) . moondog , the viking of 6th avenue : the authorized biography process music edition ( preface by philip glass ) freed left the station in may 1958 '' after a riot at a dance in boston featuring jerry lee lewis '' . wins eventually became an around-the-clock top 40 rock and roll radio station , and would remain so until april 19 , 1965 , long after freed left and three months after he had died—when it became an all-news outlet . earlier , in 1956 , freed had hosted '' alan freed 's rock ' n ' roll dance party '' on cbs radio from new york . freed also worked at wabc ( am ) starting in may 1958 but was fired from that station on november 21 , 1959 curtis , p . 37 . after refusing to sign a statement for the fcc that he had never accepted payola bribes . he subsequently arrived at a small los angeles station , kday ( 1580 am ) and worked there for about one year . . film and television . freed also appeared in a number of pioneering rock and roll motion pictures during this period . these films were often welcomed with tremendous enthusiasm by teenagers because they brought visual depictions of their favorite american acts to the big screen , years before music videos would present the same sort of image on the small television screen . freed appeared in several motion pictures that presented many of the big musical acts of his day , including : 1956 : rock around the clock featuring freed , bill haley & his comets , the platters , freddie bell and the bellboys , lisa gaye . 1956 : rock , rock , rock featuring freed , teddy randazzo , tuesday weld , chuck berry , frankie lymon and the teenagers , johnny burnette , lavern baker , the flamingos , the moonglows . 1957 : mister rock and roll featuring freed , rocky graziano and teddy randazzo , lionel hampton , ferlin husky , frankie lymon , little richard , brook benton , chuck berry , clyde mcphatter , lavern baker , screamin ' jay hawkins . 1957 : do n't knock the rock featuring freed , bill haley and his comets , alan dale , little richard and the upsetters , the treniers , dave appell and his applejacks . 1959 : go , johnny go ! featuring freed , jimmy clanton , chuck berry , ritchie valens , eddie cochran , the flamingos , jackie wilson , the cadillacs , sandy stewart , jo ann campbell , harvey fuqua and the moonglows . chuck berry also played freed 's pal and sidekick , a groundbreaking role in those days . freed was given a weekly primetime tv series , the big beat ( tv program ) , which premiered on abc on july 12 , 1957 . brooks & marsh , p . 136 . the show was scheduled for a summer run , with the understanding that if there were enough viewers , it would continue into the 1957–58 television season . although the ratings for the show were strong , it was suddenly terminated . the wall street journal summarized the end of the program as follows .

( berry was eventually able to regain the writing credit . ) in another example , harvey fuqua of the moonglows insisted freed 's name was not merely a credit on the song '' sincerely '' and that he did actually co-write it ( which would still be a conflict of interest for freed to promote ) . another group , the flamingos also claimed that freed had wrongly taken writing credit for some of their songs . in 1964 freed was indicted by a federal grand jury for tax evasion and ordered to pay 37,920 in taxes on income he had allegedly not reported . most of that income was said to be from payola sources . . personal life . on august 22 , 1943 , freed married first wife , betty lou bean . they had two children , daughter alana ( deceased ) and son lance . they divorced on december 2 , 1949 . on august 12 , 1950 , freed married marjorie j . hess . they also had two children , daughter sieglinde and son alan freed , jr . they divorced on july 25 , 1958 . on august 8 , 1958 , freed married inga lil boling with whom he had no children . they remained together until his death . jackson , p . 214 . . later years and death . because of the negative publicity from the payola scandal , no prestigious station would employ freed , and he moved to the west coast in 1960 , where he worked at kday/1580 in santa monica , california . in 1962 , after kday refused to allow him to promote '' rock and roll '' stage shows , freed moved to wqam in miami , florida , arriving in august 1962 . recognizing that his career in major markets might be over , his consumption of alcohol increased and the job lasted only two months . during 1964 , he returned to the los angeles area for a short stint at the long beach station knob/97.9 . los angeles radio people , where are they now ?
