Wilhelm Gesenius

biography . gesenius was born at nordhausen . in 1803 he became a student of philosophy and theology at the university of helmstedt , where heinrich henke was his most influential teacher ; but the latter part of his university course was taken at göttingen , where johann gottfried eichhorn and thomas christian tychsen were then at the height of their popularity . in 1806 , shortly after graduation , he became repetent and privatdozent ( or magister legens ) at göttingen ; and , as he was later proud to say , had august neander for his first pupil in hebrew language . on 8 february 1810 he became professor extraordinarius in theology , and on 16 june 1811 promoted to ordinarius , at the university of halle , where , in spite of many offers of high preferment elsewhere , he spent the rest of his life . edward frederick miller , the influence of gesenius on hebrew lexicography ( contributions to oriental history and philosophy , no . 11 ) ( 1927 , nyc , columbia univ . press ) , pages 11-13 ; edward robinson , bibliotheca sacra or tracts and essays ( 1843 , nyc ) ch . 6 , 'biographical notices of gesenius and nordheimer ' , pages 361-362 . edward robinson was an acquaintance of gesenius and the primary english translator of his works . he taught with great regularity for over thirty years . he was a gifted lecturer whose lectures were so interesting that his lecture room was consistently filled ; by 1810 his lectures were attended by more than 500 students - nearly half the entire student population of the university . edward frederick miller , the influence of gesenius on hebrew lexicography ( contributions to oriental history and philosophy , no . 11 ) ( 1927 , nyc , columbia univ . press ) , pages 14-15 ; edward robinson , bibliotheca sacra or tracts and essays ( 1843 , nyc ) ch . 6 , 'biographical notices of gesenius and nordheimer ' , page 367 . the only interruptions occurred in 1813–1814 , occasioned by the german war of liberation ( war of the sixth coalition ) , during which the university was closed , and those occasioned by two prolonged literary tours , first in 1820 to paris , london and oxford with his colleague johann karl thilo ( 1794–1853 ) for the examination of rare oriental manuscripts , and in 1835 to england and the netherlands in connection with his phoenician studies . he became the most popular teacher of hebrew and of old testament introduction and exegesis in germany ; during his later years his lectures were attended by nearly five hundred students . among his pupils the most eminent were peter von bohlen , c . p . w . gramberg , a . g . hoffmann , hermann hupfeld , emil rödiger , j . c . f . tuch , j . k . w . vatke and theodor benfey . his first hebrew lexicon ( with german text ) was worked up during the winter of 1806–1807 , and published a few years later by f . c . w . vogel , whose printing house in leipzig thereafter published all the editions of his lexicons . this was followed by a somewhat abridged version ( about half the bulk of the first lexicon but with significant improvements ) in 1815 , which went to four german editions ( each substantially larger and improved than its previous editions ) and one latin edition ( although intended merely as a translation of the german edition , this too was a reworked revisions ) . edward frederick miller , the influence of gesenius on hebrew lexicography ( contributions to oriental history and philosophy , no . 11 ) ( 1927 , nyc , columbia university press ) , pages 16 , 35-45 . his large lexicon of biblical hebrew and chaldee ( aramaic ) was first published in 1829 , and its revision and expansion , under the editorship of rödiger , continued after gesenius 's death until 1858 . his textbook on hebrew grammar first appeared , as a small book of a mere 202 pages , in 1813 , and went through 13 editions in gesenius 's lifetime and as many afterward . edward frederick miller , the influence of gesenius on hebrew lexicography ( contributions to oriental history and philosophy , no . 11 ) ( 1927 , nyc , columbia university press ) , page 16 ; edward robinson , bibliotheca sacra or tracts and essays ( 1843 , nyc ) ch . 6 , 'biographical notices of gesenius and nordheimer ' , page 371 . he also published some smaller works , in german , on the grammatical anomalies found in the hebrew text of the old testament . edward frederick miller , the influence of gesenius on hebrew lexicography ( contributions to oriental history and philosophy , no . 11 ) ( 1927 , nyc , columbia university press ) , page 17 . he also wrote extensively on the samaritans and their version of the pentateuch , edward frederick miller , the influence of gesenius on hebrew lexicography ( contributions to oriental history and philosophy , no . 11 ) ( 1927 , nyc , columbia university press ) , page 18 . and on the phoenicians and their language . edward robinson , bibliotheca sacra or tracts and essays ( 1843 , nyc ) ch . 6 , 'biographical notices of gesenius and nordheimer ' , page 370 . in 1827 , after declining an invitation to take eichhorn 's place at göttingen , gesenius was made a . in 1830 there were violent verbal attacks to which he , along with his friend and colleague julius wegscheider , were subjected by e . w . hengstenberg and his party in the evangelische kirchenzeitung , on account of his rationalism and his lecture comments treating lightly the biblical accounts of miracles . edward frederick miller , the influence of gesenius on hebrew lexicography ( contributions to oriental history and philosophy , no . 11 ) ( 1927 , nyc , columbia university press ) , page 19 . he was thereafter troubled with personal stresses ; in 1833 he nearly died of lung disease , in 1835 three of his children died , and subsequently he was tormented by various physical complaints . his death in 1842 came after prolonged misery from gall stones . edward frederick miller , the influence of gesenius on hebrew lexicography ( contributions to oriental history and philosophy , no . 11 ) ( 1927 , nyc , columbia university press ) , pages 19-21 ; edward robinson , bibliotheca sacra or tracts and essays ( 1843 , nyc ) ch . 6 , 'biographical notices of gesenius and nordheimer ' , pages 369 and 376 . robinson said that three of his children died in 1835 , miller says '' several '' children . gesenius died at halle and is buried near the university . according to tradition , theology students in halle put stones on his grave as a token of respect every year before their examinations . gesenius takes much of the credit for having freed semitic philology from the trammels of theological and religious prepossession , and for inaugurating the strictly scientific ( and comparative ) method which has since been so fruitful . as an exegete he exercised a powerful influence on theological investigation . he may also be considered as a founder of phoenician studies . '' wilhelm gesenius '' , in je m'appelle byblos , jean-pierre thiollet , h & d , 2005 , p . 253 . gesenius was keenly aware of previous efforts at dictionaries of biblical hebrew ( he provided an extensive survey of hebrew lexicography in the 1823 edition of his hebrew lexicon for schools an english translation of this essay , '' on the sources of hebrew philology and lexicography '' , appears in the biblical repository , ed . by edward robinson , vol . 3 , nr . 9 ( jan . 1833 ) pages 1-44 . ) , and , compared to previous lexicons which had simply translated hebrew expressions as whatever other versions ( primarily the septuagint and the vulgate ) had in the same verses , his own contribution to that field was the inclusion of insights obtained from the study of other languages , ancient and non-semitic . edward robinson , bibliotheca sacra or tracts and essays ( 1843 , nyc ) ch . 6 , 'biographical notices of gesenius and nordheimer ' , page 369 . from his extensive body of work , the products most familiar to modern english-speaking readers are his hebrew grammar , best represented by an english translation of the 28th german edition , published by oxford university press in 1910 , gesenius ' hebrew grammar as edited and enlarged by e . kautzsch , second english edition , translated and revised in accordance with the 28th german edition ( 1909 ) by a . e . cowley ( 1910 , oxford at the clarendon press , 598 pages ) . and his dictionary of biblical hebrew and aramaic , known through a number of english translations , including the gesenius ' hebrew and chaldee lexicon to the old testament scriptures , a 1853 edition revised by samuel prideaux tregelles gesenius ' hebrew and chaldee lexicon to the old testament scriptures , translated with additions and corrections from the author 's thesaurus and other works by samuel prideaux tregelles ( 1853 , london , samuel bagster and sons , 884 pages ) . and the brown–driver–briggs , a 1907 edition revised by francis brown , samuel rolles driver and charles a . briggs . a hebrew and english lexicon of the old testament , based on the lexicon of william gesenius , as translated by edward robinson , edited by francis brown with the co-operation of s . r . driver and charles a . briggs ( 1907 , ny & boston , houghton mifflin , 1127 pages ) , and reprinted by several other publishers . as indicated by the title pages , the german editions of these works were carried forward by several revised editions , after gesenius 's death , by other scholars , most conspicuously emil rödiger , into the 20th century . edward robinson , an acquaintance of gesenius , and his principal english translator and biographer , said of him , '' so clear were his own conception , that he never uttered a sentence , no scarcely ever wrote one , which even the dullest intellect did not at once comprehend . in this respect , he may be said to stand out almost alone among modern german scholars . in all that fell within the proper sphere of his own researches , he never rested upon the authority of others , but investigated for himself , with all the minute accuracy and closeness of detail and unwearied industry for which german learning is celebrated . his one great object was philological truth . he had no preconceived theories , to the support of which he was at all hazards committed , and in connection with which only he sought for truth . these traits , combined with his extensive learning , inspired a confidence in his researches and opinions on topics connected with hebrew philology , such as has been bestowed on few scholars .
