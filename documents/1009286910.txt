Echo & the Bunnymen

shine so hard . the band embarked on their first major concert tour between september and december 1980 to promote the crocodiles album , supported by london band the sound , during which they performed their first european concerts in france , the netherlands and germany . the end of the '' camo '' tour was followed by a four-month break , which was mainly dedicated to the preparation and recording of their second lp . however , manager bill drummond ( later of klf ) and lighting director bill butt also launched plans for a one-off promotional concert event as the final date of the '' camo '' tour , which would be professionally filmed and recorded . it was primarily intended to provide material for the group 's first music video , but drummond and butt 's vision went well beyond the conventional 3-minute pop-rock promotional clip , and it also reflected their desire to capture echo & the bunnymen 's live performance during this crucial breakthrough phase of their career . butt was originally slated to direct , but british film union regulations at the time meant that the film would not be distributed commercially unless it was directed by a union member . butt took over as producer , and on the recommendation of their mutual friend , patrick duval , butt engaged novice filmmaker john smith , who had earned a union ticket for a film he had directed while at university . after extensive consultation with their clients , smith and duval were '' embedded '' in buxton with the band in the week leading up to the concert , and they were given a completely free hand to structure , shoot and edit the project . smith and duval shaped the first part of the film around the differing characters of the four band members , filming both the town and the musicians , but using unusual shooting angles and perspectives . this material was then assembled into an impressionistic sequence of seemingly disconnected images , which are gradually revealed to be a montage of the activities of the band members as they prepare for and head to the show . the concert itself was staged on january 17 , 1981 , in the striking victorian-era glass concert hall in the buxton pavilion gardens in derbyshire , before a specially-invited audience . prior to the show , advertisements had been placed in the music press , and 500 lucky fans who responded were given free passes and a map directing them to the secret location ( called '' gomorrah '' in the advertisement ) , which also advised '' be prepared : this is an atlas adventure '' . for an additional fee of £5 , coach transport was provided for fans from london , liverpool and other cities . although inclement winter weather complicated the rehearsals , causing transport headaches for the band , as well as for their fans , the concert went ahead as planned , with the band taking the stage 30 minutes after the scheduled start time . the performance was filmed by smith , duval and cameraman mike tomlinson , with multitrack audio recorded on the manor mobile studio by peter woods . the footage captures the band at the height of their early success , and documents both their musical prowess as a live act and the impressive staging and lighting designed by bill butt . the set list was drawn mainly from crocodiles , plus previews of several tracks from the upcoming second album . the finished 33-minute short film combined smith and duval 's opening montage with dynamic footage of four songs from the show . titled shine so hard : an atlas adventure , it was given a limited uk cinema release , although warner executives were reportedly dismayed by its avant-garde structure and the fact that the band do n't even appear clearly until partway through the film . the audio recordings of the four songs featured in the film were also released on the '' shine so hard '' ep , which reached 37 on the uk singles chart , thus becoming the group 's first british hit single . in 1982 the film was also released as a limited edition of 500 vhs cassettes , redeemable only with a voucher given out to those who had attended the concert , although copies soon found their way onto the second-hand market . heaven up here . beginning in april 1981 , the band commenced another round of touring to promote the forthcoming album . this included their first american dates , in new york , toronto , pittsburgh , detroit , chicago , boston , san francisco , and los angeles . after another round of shows in the uk and europe mid-year , they returned to america for more shows during october , and in november they made their only visit to australia , including a show on november 11 at the manly vale hotel on sydney 's northern beaches . this was recorded , and four tracks from that concert were subsequently included as bonus tracks on the 2003 cd reissue of the second album . heaven up here was recorded at rockfield studios in wales during march , and was released in may 1981 . produced by the band and hugh jones , it proved a very positive and enjoyable recording experience for the band , and became an even bigger critical and commercial success , reaching the uk top ten ( no . & nbsp ; 10 ) , although the sole single lifted from the album , '' a promise '' , only reached uk no . & nbsp ; 49 . the cover image continued the elemental theme of crocodiles , and depicted the group standing on a beach , with their backs to the camera , looking out to sea , silhouetted against a bank of storm clouds at sunset , with a flock of seagulls flying across sky in front of them . the photograph was taken on the beach at porthcawl in south wales on a day off from recording . according to photographer brian griffin , they had to use buckets of fish offal to entice the seagulls to fly through thr shot . manager bill drummond and korova label head rob dickins reportedly hated the image and atkins , griffin and the band had to fight to have it accepted as the cover shot . porcupine and mainstream success . after another break over the northern winter , the band played three uk dates in april 1982 . in june they scored their first top 20 uk hit single with '' the back of love '' ( no . & nbsp ; 19 ) . in july they began a short round of festival appearances and headlining concerts in britain and europe , including an appearance at the first womad festival , where they were joined onstage for the song '' all my colours ( zimbo ) '' by the drummers of burundi . their only american date that year was a one-off show at new york 's peppermint lounge on august 24 , and their 1982 touring schedule concluded with four uk dates in december . much of 1982 , however , was taken up with the difficult and protracted process of recording of their highly anticipated third album , porcupine , which reunited them with crocodiles producer ian broudie ( who was also sargeant 's housemate at the time ) . several members also undertook outside projects during the year - pete de freitas produced and played drums on liverpool band the wild swans ' debut single '' revolutionary spirit '' , and lead guitarist will sergeant recorded a solo album of instrumental music called themes for 'grind ' ( 1982 ) . 2 the original version of porcupine was rejected by warner bros as '' too uncommercial '' , so ( over sargent 's objections ) the band agreed to re-record entire lp , and drummond brought in noted indian violinist and composer shankar to add strings . during this period tensions within the band had increased dramatically - bassist les pattinson was openly expressing his weariness with the industry , and personal relations between the four deteriorated to the point that they either refused to speak to each other , or argued when they did . mcculloch later described the band 's mood at this time as '' horrible '' , and de freitas opined that , in stark contrast to the quick and confident making of heaven up here , he felt that with porcupine , '' we had to drag it out of ourselves '' . despite these impediments , the re-recording went relatively smoothly , and the sessions ultimately produced their uk chart breakthrough . released in early 1983 , the more radio-friendly '' the cutter '' , became their first top 10 single , climbing to no . & nbsp ; 8 , while the parent album , porcupine ( feb . 1983 ) , hit no . 2 in the album chart . now firmly established as a chart act , further hits followed with a one-off single , the dance-oriented '' never stop '' ( no . & nbsp ; 15 ) , and the epic '' the killing moon '' , a preview from the new album featuring a dramatic mcculloch vocal , which became the band 's second uk top 10 single at no . & nbsp ; 9 . . ocean rain . the band kicked off a hectic year of touring in 1984 with their first dates in japan , in january , followed by a month-long round of dates in the united states beginning in march . april-may saw them playing multiple concerts in europe and the uk , followed by the second and more extensive leg of their us tour during august-september , concluding with a show at the famed greek theater in los angeles on september 9 . the band then immediately undertook an intensive two month uk tour , beginning in dublin on september 15 and concluding at london 's brixton academy on october 24 ( their last concert of 1984 ) . following a pr campaign which proclaimed it '' the greatest album ever made '' according to mcculloch , 1984 's ocean rain reached no . & nbsp ; 4 , and today is widely regarded as the band 's landmark album . single extracts '' silver '' ( uk no . & nbsp ; 30 ) and '' seven seas '' ( uk no . & nbsp ; 16 ) consolidated the album 's continued commercial success . in the same year , mcculloch had a minor solo hit with his cover version of the kurt weill standard '' september song '' . after the release of ocean rain , manager bill drummond announced that the band was taking a year off to write material for the next album , but at the end of 1984 they replaced him , reportedly because they were unhappy that the band was n't making enough money . drummond was succeeded by duran duran tour manager mick hancock . echo & the bunnymen resumed work with a tour of scandinavia in april 1985 , performing cover versions of songs from television , the rolling stones , talking heads and the doors . recordings from the tour emerged as the semi-bootleg on strike . on 21 june they performed a headlining set at that year 's glastonbury festival , where they premiered two new songs from their next album . fifth album and departure of de freitas . ocean rain proved difficult to follow up , and their only releases in 1985 were the single , '' bring on the dancing horses '' ( uk no . & nbsp ; 21 ) , and a compilation album , songs to learn & sing , which made no . 6 in the uk album chart . 1985/86 proved to be the turning point in the group 's career . during their regular winter break , drummer pete de freitas had relocated to america with a loose group of musical colleagues , friends and hangers-on dubbed '' the sex gods '' , but the other bunnymen and his family later revealed that de freitas was suffering from escalating mental health and drug problems , and following a new year 's eve drug binge in new orleans , de freitas announced that he had quit the band . with tour commitments looming , the remaining members hastily recruited former haircut one hundred drummer blair cunningham as their new drummer , but he did not fit in , and left after their spring 1986 american tour . cunningham was replaced by former abc drummer david palmer . the group began recording material for the new album with broudie and producer clive langer but they were unhappy with the results and the recordings were shelved . they then recorded with laurie latham , who was chosen by mcculloch because he had been impressed by latham 's work on the stranglers ' single '' golden brown '' . three tracks from these sessions eventually made their way onto the next album , including the song '' jimmy brown '' , which was subsequently re-titled '' bring on the dancing horses '' , and released as their only single of 1986 . echo & the bunnymen returned to the studio to record more material with a new producer , gil norton , but in july david palmer left the group , and de freitas expressed his wish to rejoin . the other members were concerned about both his commitment to the band and his drug and mental health problems , so he returned to group as a hired musician rather than a full member of the band . the reconstituted lineup performed live on bbc-tv in september , presenting two new songs , '' the game '' and '' lips like sugar '' , but by this stage they were under intense pressure from their label to create what warners considered to be more commercial material -- will sergeant later recalled the band 's outrage when warner executive rob dickens played them peter gabriel 's so album , declaring '' i want you to sound like this ! '' their fifth studio album , the self-titled echo & the bunnymen ( 1987 ) , was initially recorded with palmer , but when de freitas returned in late 1986 , it was largely re-recorded . eventually released in mid-1987 , the record sold well ( uk no . & nbsp ; 4 ) , and was a small american hit , their only lp to have significant sales there . it also significant as the final album to be recorded with the original lineup . like porcupine , the making of the album proved to be a difficult and protracted process . early sessions with gil norton took place at the famous cologne studio of german producer conny plank , but both band and label were unhappy with the results and these recordings were shelved . they began re-recording material from the cologne sessions with laurie latham in brussels , but the sessions were gruelling , with latham spending up to a month on a single song , and tensions within the band were being inflamed by mcculloch 's increasing alcohol use , and the star treatment he was being accorded . in the united states , the band 's best-known songs were '' the killing moon '' and '' lips like sugar '' . '' bring on the dancing horses '' is well known as one of the songs on the soundtrack to the john hughes film pretty in pink . the band also contributed a cover version of the doors song '' people are strange '' to the lost boys soundtrack , which featured a guest appearance by original doors keyboard player ray manzarek , who also contributed keyboards to a re-recorded version of '' bedbugs and ballyhoo '' . '' never stop '' was also used in the alan bennett film history boys . although the album was a significant commercial success , it received mixed reviews from critics , and was disliked by the band , who were sharply critical of the mixing and production . departure of mcculloch , death of de freitas , sixth album , and disbandment . the group jointly headlined an american tour with new order in august-september 1987 , followed by a uk tour in the northern autumn . after a winter break they undertook another round of touring in the us and the uk , to general acclaim , but the march 1988 single release of their cover of the doors ' '' people are strange '' drew withering reviews from the music press , with melody maker denouncing it as '' a rancid effort '' . the end of the original echo & the bunnymen came in march 1988 . following a japanese tour , mcculloch announced that the band was breaking up . he hastily departed for the uk to see his father , who had just suffered two heart attacks , but he died just before mcculloch arrived . months of speculation finally ended in september 1988 when mcculloch officially informed the other members that he was leaving the band , but sergeant told mcculloch that he , pattinson and de freitas would continue working together . mcculloch departed , and later began work on his first solo album , candleland . following an abortive attempt to record with singers kate pierson and cindy wilson of the b-52s , the group advertised for a new lead singer . former colenso parade singer oscar turned down an offer to take over from mcculloch , larkin , colin : '' the guinness who 's who of indie and new wave music '' , page 67 . guinness publishing , 1992 , keyboardist jake brockman ( a touring member of the band for several years previously , and a contributor to the 1987 album ) was promoted to full member , and after hearing an album by the defunct uk group st vitus dance , the bunnymen offered the lead singer spot to vocalist noel burke , who accepted after the band assured him that they did not want '' a mcculloch clone '' . however , their plans were thrown into disarray when pete de freitas was tragically killed in a motorcycle accident on 14 june 1989 . de freitas was on his way to liverpool from london to take part in the group 's first rehearsal with burke , when his ducati motorbike collided with another vehicle on the a51 at longdon green in staffordshire , killing him instantly . he was only 27 years old , and was survived by his widow and their infant daughter , who was born in 1988 . after recruiting new drummer damon reece to replace de freitas , the new five-piece bunnymen recorded the psychedelic-tinged reverberation in 1990 with renowned former beatles engineer and producer geoff emerick . the album did not generate much interest among fans or critics , it sold poorly , and the band was subsequently dropped by their label warner bros . in a 2003 interview , mcculloch said of his replacement with burke : i think it 's pretty obvious what i think . noel burke . the name says it all really does n't it ? no , that 's not fair . it was n't his fault , it was will and pete who were the berks really . but no , i thought it was disgraceful and after that i suppose it was quite surprising that i continued working with will after that . i 'm glad i did though . johnny marr called them echo and the bogusmen when that happened . meanwhile , mcculloch released his well-received debut solo album , candleland in september 1989 , shortly after de freitas ' death ; the album reflected a new maturity influenced by the deaths of his father and his late bandmate . his follow-up solo album was mysterio in 1992 . after two more unsuccessful singles , which were released independently , the bunnymen disbanded in 1993 . reformation . in 1994 , mcculloch and sergeant began working together again under the name electrafixion ; in 1997 pattinson rejoined the duo , meaning the three surviving members of the original bunnymen line-up were now working together again . rather than continue as electrafixion , the trio resurrected the echo & the bunnymen name and released the album evergreen ( 1997 ) , which reached the uk top 10 . immediately prior to the release of the band 's next album , what are you going to do with your life ? ( 1999 ) , les pattinson quit to take care of his mother . mcculloch and sergeant have continued to tour and record as echo & the bunnymen , touring repeatedly and releasing the albums flowers ( 2001 ) , siberia ( 2005 ) , the fountain ( 2009 ) and meteorites ( 2014 ) . the siberia band line up was ian mcculloch , will sergeant , paul fleming ( keyboards ) , simon finley ( drums ) and pete wilkinson ( bass ) , hugh jones produced siberia after previously engineering early bunnymen albums . since august 2009 the group 's touring incarnation has comprised mcculloch and sergeant along with stephen brannan ( bass ) , gordy goudie ( guitar ) , nicholas kilroe ( drums ) and jez wing ( keyboards ) . in 2002 , the group received the q awards award . the award is for inspiring '' new generations of musicians , songs and music lovers in general . '' the band were said to be worthy winners as they have done much to promote the mersey music scene . in a later interview for magnet magazine , mcculloch said '' it validates everything that we 've tried to achieve—cool , great timeless music . it 's not like an inspiration award affecting the past , it 's affecting the current music . '' on 11 september 2006 , echo & the bunnymen released an updated version of their 1985 songs to learn and sing compilation . now re-titled more songs to learn and sing , this new compilation was issued in two versions , a 17-track single cd and a 20-track version with a dvd featuring eight videos from their career . in march 2007 , the bunnymen announced that they had re-signed to their original record label , warner , and were also working on a new album . the band were also said to be planning a live dvd , entitled '' dancing horses '' , which also contained interviews with the band . this was released in may 2007 , on snapper/spv . the live line up was ian mcculloch , will sergeant , simon finley ( drums ) , paul fleming ( keyboards ) , gordy goudie ( guitar ) and steve brannan ( bass ) . on 11 january 2008 , mcculloch was interviewed on bbc breakfast at the start of liverpool 08 . he was asked about new bunnymen material and he revealed that a new album would coincide with their gig at the royal albert hall in september . he went on to say that the album was , '' the best one we 've made , apart from ocean rain . '' in a 20 april 2008 interview with the sunday mail , ian mcculloch announced the fountain as the title of the new echo & the bunnymen album with producers john mclaughlin and simon perry , which was originally due to be released in 2008 but was finally released on 12 october 2009 . the first single from the album , '' think i need it too '' , was released on 28 september 2009 . on 1 september 2009 , former keyboard player jake brockman died on the isle of man , when his motorbike collided with a converted ambulance . brockman had played keyboards for the band during the 1980s . in december 2010 , echo & the bunnymen went on tour playing their first two albums crocodiles and heaven up here in their entirety . echo & the bunnymen 's most recent album of new material , entitled meteorites , was released on 26 may 2014 in the uk , and on 3 june 2014 in the us via 429 records . the album was also released on the pledgemusic.com website . the album was produced and mixed by youth , who also co-wrote three of the tracks and played '' additional bass '' on it . it was the band 's first uk top 40 album entry since 1999 . in 2018 , echo & the bunnymen announced and released an album of reworked orchestral versions of older material and two new songs , entitled the stars , the oceans & the moon , to mixed reception . members . current members . ian mcculloch – vocals , guitar ( 1978–1988 , 1996–present ) will sergeant – guitars , programming ( 1978–1993 , 1996–present ) . former members . les pattinson – bass ( 1978–1993 , 1996–1998 ) pete de freitas – drums ( 1979–1989 ;
