Richard Amerike

biography . 'amerike ' is an anglicised spelling of the welsh ap meuric , ap meurig or ap meryk , which means '' son of meurig '' . it was , however , only one of the many different ways that the customs officer 's name was rendered , even in official documents . the 'amerike ' version was noted by some modern historians because it looked like 'america ' and because this was how his name was spelled on a tomb brass created for his daughter in 1538 . evan t . jones and margaret m . condon , cabot and bristol 's age of discovery : the bristol discovery voyages 1480–1508 ( university of bristol , nov . 2016 )

herefordshire . he may have been born earlier than this , since one of amerike 's daughters , joan , was married to a future lawyer , john broke , by april 1479 . a . s . ellis , 'on the manorial

overseas trade of bristol in the later middle ages ( bristol record society 1937 ) , pp . 150–51 amerike was a burgess of bristol by at least the mid-1470s . becoming a burgess would have admitted him as a both a freeman of the city , and marked him as a member of its political elite . by this time he was sufficiently wealthy to lend £50 towards the ransom from breton pirates of a great-nephew of william canynges . a bristol tax return of 1484 records that his household servants included an icelander . david beers quinn , england and the discovery of america ( london , 1974 ) , pp . 49–51 . he was also buying land . by the early 1490s amerike 's main landed estate , acquired by purchase , seems to have been in long ashton on the somerset side of the river avon . when amerike traded as a merchant , he would have used a distinctive merchant 's mark to identify his goods . unfortunately when amerike shipped on the trinity of bristol for a voyage to andalucia in 1480 the purser , whose private accounts survive , failed to record the mark of amerike , or indeed of any other merchant shipping . t . f . reddaway and alwyn a . ruddock , 'the accounts of john balsall , purser of the

service in bristol 's neighbouring port of bridgwater , with the post of controller of customs . this should have meant that he dwelled within the confines of the port ( which included minehead and combwich ) , but whether he did so is unknown . in september 1486 amerike became one of the customs officials in bristol , holding the post of king 's customs officer , known as a 'customer ' , from 1486 until december 1502 . during his period of office he was several times accused of malpractice , including false accounting , and was obliged to pay a substantial sum of money to the king , henry vii , for his pardon . evan t . jones and margaret m . condon , cabot and bristol 's age of discovery : the bristol discovery voyages 1480–1508 ( university of bristol , nov . 2016 ) , p . 76 as a customs officer amerike could not hold high civic office since this was forbidden by statute . but at the first election after he had ceased to be customer , he was appointed as one of the city 's two sheriffs . he died in post , probably around december 1503 , and was replaced as sheriff by robert thorne .
