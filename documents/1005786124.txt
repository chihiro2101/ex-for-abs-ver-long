RMS Queen Elizabeth

adjustments to the compass and some final testing of equipment were also carried out before she sailed to her secret destination . captain townley discovered that he was to take the ship directly to new york in the then neutral united states without stopping , or even slowing to drop off the southampton harbour pilot who had embarked on at clydebank , and to maintain strict radio silence . later that day , at the time when she was due to arrive at southampton , the city was bombed by the luftwaffe . queen elizabeth zigzagged across the atlantic to elude german u-boats and took six days to reach new york at an average speed of 26 knots . in new york she found herself moored alongside both queen mary and the french line 's , the only time all three of the world 's largest ocean liners were ever berthed together . captain townley received two telegrams on his arrival , one from his wife congratulating him , and the other from her majesty queen elizabeth thanking him for the vessel 's safe delivery . the ship was then secured so that no one could board her without prior permission , including port officials . queen elizabeth left the port of new york on 13 november 1940 for singapore to receive her troopship conversion . after two stops to refuel and replenish her stores in trinidad and cape town , she arrived in singapore 's naval docks , where she was fitted with anti-aircraft guns , and her hull repainted grey . as a troopship , queen elizabeth left singapore on 11 february , and on 23 february 1942 queen elizabeth secretly arrived in esquimalt , british columbia , canada . she underwent refit work in drydock adding accommodation and armaments , and three hundred naval ratings quickly painted the hull . in mid-march , carrying 8,000 american soldiers , queen elizabeth began a 7,700-mile voyage from san francisco to sydney , australia . the rms queen elizabeth ( 1942 ) zacha 's bay window gallery initially she carried australian troops to theatres of operation in asia and africa . after 1942 , the two queens were relocated to the north atlantic for the transportation of american troops to europe . queen elizabeth and queen mary were both used as troop transports during the war . their high speeds allowed them to outrun hazards , principally german u-boats , usually allowing them to travel outside a convoy . during her war service as a troopship , queen elizabeth carried more than 750,000 troops , and she also sailed some . . post-second world war . following the end of the second world war , queen elizabeth was refitted and furnished as an ocean liner , while her running mate queen mary remained in her wartime role and grey appearance except for her funnels , which were repainted in the company 's colours . for another year , her sibling did military service , returning troops and war bride to the united states while queen elizabeth was overhauled at the firth of clyde drydock , in greenock , by the john brown shipyard . six years of war service had never permitted the formal sea trials to take place , so they were now finally undertaken . under the command of commodore sir james bisset , the ship travelled to the isle of arran and her trials were carried out . on board was the ship 's namesake , queen elizabeth , and her two daughters , princesses elizabeth and margaret . during the trials , queen elizabeth took the wheel for a brief time , and the two young princesses recorded the two measured runs with stopwatches that they had been given for the occasion . bisset was under strict instructions from sir percy bates , who was also aboard the trials , that all that was required from the ship was two measured runs of no more than 30 knots and that she was not permitted to attempt to attain a higher speed record than queen mary . r.m.s . queen elizabeth queen elizabeths engines were capable of driving her to speeds of over 32 knots . after her trials queen elizabeth finally entered passenger service , allowing cunard white star to launch the long-planned two-ship weekly service to new york . maxtone-graham 1972 , p . 396 despite specifications similar to those of queen mary , queen elizabeth never held the blue riband , for cunard white star chairman sir percy bates asked that the two ships do not to try to compete against each other . the ship ran aground on a sandbank off southampton on 14 april 1947 , and was re-floated the following day . in 1955 , during an annual overhaul at southampton , england , queen elizabeth was fitted with underwater fin stabilisers to smooth the ride in rough seas . two fins were fitted on each side of the hull . the fins were retractable into the hull to save fuel in smooth seas and for docking .

'' popular science , june 1955 , pp . 122â€“124 . on 29 july 1959 , she was in a collision with the american freighter american hunter in foggy conditions in new york harbor and was holed above the waterline . together with queen mary and in competition with the american liners and , queen elizabeth dominated the transatlantic passenger trade until their fortunes began to decline with the advent of the faster and more economical jet airliner in the late 1950s . as passenger numbers declined , the liners became uneconomic to operate in the face of rising fuel and labour costs . for a short time the queen elizabeth , now under the command of commodore geoffrey trippleton marr attempted a dual role in order to become more profitable ; when not plying her usual transatlantic route , which she now alternated in her sailings with the french line 's ss france , the ship cruised between new york and nassau . for this new tropical purpose , the ship received a major refit in 1965 , with a new lido deck added to her aft section , enhanced air conditioning , and an outdoor swimming pool . with these improvements , cunard intended to keep the ship in operation until at least the mid-1970s . maxtone-graham 1972 , p . 409 however , the strategy did not prove successful , owing to the ship 's deep draught , which prevented her from entering various island ports , her width , which preventing her from using the panama canal , and also her high fuel costs . cunard retired queen mary in 1967 and queen elizabeth by 1969 , and replaced them both with new more economical queen elizabeth 2 . final years . in 1968 , queen elizabeth was sold to a group of american businessmen from a company called the queen corporation ( which was 85 % owned by cunard and 15 % by them ) . the new company intended to operate the ship as a hotel and tourist attraction in port everglades , florida , similar to the planned use of queen mary in long beach , california . elizabeth , as she was now called , opened to tourists before queen mary ( which opened in 1971 ) but it was not to last . the climate of southern florida was much harder on queen elizabeth than the climate of southern california was on queen mary . there was some talk of permanently flooding the bilge and allowing the queen elizabeth to rest on the bed of the intracoastal waterway in ft . lauderdale harbour ( port everglades ) and remain open , but the ship was forced to close after losing money and being declared a fire hazard . the vessel was sold at auction in 1970 to hong kong tycoon tung chao yung . tung , the head of the orient overseas line , intended to convert the vessel into a university for the semester at sea program ( later reformed and renamed as semester at sea ) . following the tradition of the orient overseas line , the ship was renamed seawise university , as a play on tung 's initials ( c.y . 's ) . the ship was now under hong kong ownership , and it was decided to sail her to hong kong . this proved to be problematic , for the ship 's engines and boilers were in poor condition after several years of neglect . the now retired commodore marr and a former chief engineer of the ship were hired by tung as advisors for the journey to hong kong . marr recommended that seawise university be towed to the new territories , but tung and his crew were convinced that they could sail the ship there using just the aft engines and boilers . the planned several-week trip turned into months as the crew battled with boiler issues and a fire . an unplanned lengthy mid-voyage stopover allowed the new owners to fly spare parts out to the ship and carry out repairs before resuming the course to hong kong harbour . with the Â£5 & nbsp ; million conversion nearing completion , the vessel caught fire on 9 january 1972 . there is some suspicion that the fires were set deliberately , as several blazes broke out simultaneously throughout the ship . the fact that c.y . tung had acquired the vessel for 3.5 & nbsp ; million , and had insured it for 8 & nbsp ; million , led some to speculate that the inferno was part of a fraud to collect on the insurance claim . others speculated that the fires were the result of a conflict between tung , a chinese nationalist , and communist-dominated ship construction unions . the ship was completely destroyed by the fire , and the water sprayed on her by fireboats caused the burnt wreck to sink in hong kong 's victoria harbour . the vessel was finally declared a shipping hazard and dismantled for scrap between 1974 and 1975 . portions of the hull that were not salvaged were left at the bottom of the bay . the keel , boilers and engines remained at the bottom of the harbour , and the area was marked as '' foul '' on local sea charts , warning ships not to try to anchor there . it is estimated that around 40â€“50 % of the wreck was still on the seabed . in the late 1990s , the last remains of the wreck were buried during land reclamation for the construction of container terminal 9 . position of the wreck : . after the fire , tung had one of the liner 's anchors and the metal letters '' q '' and '' e '' from the name on the bow placed in front of the office building at del amo fashion center in torrance , california , which had been intended as the headquarters of the seawise university venture ; they later went on display with commemorative plaques in the lobby of wall street plaza , 88 pine street , new york city . two of the ship 's fire warning system brass plaques were recovered by a dredger , and were displayed at the aberdeen boat club in hong kong in an exhibit about the ship . the charred remnants of her last ensign were cut from the flagpole and framed in 1972 , and still adorn the wall of the officers ' mess of marine police hq in hong kong . parker pen company produced a special edition of 5,000 pens made from material recovered from the wreck , each in a presentation box ; today these are highly collectible . following the demise of queen elizabeth , the largest passenger ship in active service became the 66,343 gt , which was longer but with less tonnage than the cunarder . in fiction . in 1959 , the ship made an appearance in the british satirical comedy film the mouse that roared , starring peter sellers and jean seberg . while a troupe of invading men from '' grand fenwick '' , a fictional european micro-nation , cross the atlantic to 'war ' with the united states , they meet and pass the far larger queen elizabeth , and learn that new york city is closed due to an air raid drill . ian fleming set the climax to his 1956 james bond novel diamonds are forever on queen elizabeth . the 1971 diamonds are forever ( film ) used the p & o liner for the sequence . canberra â€“ the james bond ship the wreck was featured in the 1974 james bond film the man with the golden gun , as a covert headquarters for mi6 . q 's labs also are in the wreckage of this ship . references . further reading . harvey , clive , 2008 , r.m.s . queen elizabeth the ultimate ship , carmania press , london , . external links . cunard line white star line r.m.s . queen elizabeth the great ocean liners : queen elizabeth rms queen elizabeth story and picture pathe newsreel of queen elizabeth being built
